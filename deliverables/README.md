## Problem Statement

The new SAT format was formally introduced in 2016. Participation has generally been good but some states have seen lower participation rates. Using the state participation data for 2017, compare with the participation in 2018 and make recommendations to the College Board to help increase participation in future SATs.

## Executive Summary

Average participation rate in SAT was 46% in 2018, increasing 5.9% from 2017. 33 or 65% of all states increased their SAT participation in 2018. Illinois and Colorado had the highest increase in participation of 90% and 89% respectively due to a partnership with these states to get all high school students to take the SAT. However, the sudden influx of ill-prepared students taking SAT in these states had resulted in a drastic drop in SAT scores for Illinois (-96 points) and Colorado (-176 points). Florida, on the other hand saw their SAT scores improve by 82 points even after increasing participation from 83% in 2017 to 97% in 2018. The College Board's partnership with Khan's Academy have contributed to Florida's success in improving on the SAT scores while increasing state participation.

Using Florida as a success example, evangelise the adoption of Khan Academy as a free enabler to guide high school students to do well in the SATs. As evidenced in Florida's case, letting students take the SAT during a regular school day will further encourage participation from students.

### Conclusion:
Taking Florida as an example, it is the most improved state in 2018 for SAT Total score, even after increasing their participation in SAT from 83% to 97%. The other two states Colorado and Illinois which had SAT mandated as the exam by the state did not see the same success. How did Florida achieve that?

There was already a high participation rate of 83% in 2017 for Florida. Through the partnership with Khan Academy, students could now make use of the free, online lessons and practice tests to help prepare for the SAT. With better preparation, their scores have improved.

### Recommendation:
For North Dakota, SAT participation in 2018 is at only 2% but it is among top-5 states with most improved SAT total scores. The students who have taken the SAT test must have benefitted from the Khan Academy resources provided as well.

To increase SAT participation in North Dakota, I will recommend the following:
1. Use Florida as a successful case study to emulate.


2. Do not partner with the state of North Dakota to make it the default exam, as proven by Illinois and Colorado which saw their SAT scores take a hugh drop. This will instill a negative sentiment towards taking the SAT.


3. Promote the **importance of learning** and highlight the availability of online resources like **Khan Academy**, that SAT has made available to help them do well in the SAT.


4. Sweeten the deal by arranging with schools to allow students to take SAT during a regular school day.
