Lately I have dabbled into Islamic faith and have began reading the Quran and the Bible and I do really enjoy it.

Please not this post is not taking shots as muslims. I believe the book if Mohummed is very good but I really feel that the book is an angry approach to islamic faith. Almost every chapter talks about punishment for not believing Allah, or for wrong doing. There are a few examples of sexism, one that comes to mind is the distrubtion of the will that your daughter is to inherit less of the will then your son. 

The bible on the other hand is more calming. There is punishment but you also see God interacting with the people. I think God visited Abraham and stayed for dinner and then went down to two cities of sinners and destroyed them both. The bible also seems to have a lot of incest mind you I have only read the old testament.

To my understanding the Quran was established by Muhammed in 500 AD where as the bible predates BC era. It also claimed that Gabrial would go into his body and speak the words of the Quran. To me it sounds like Muhammed was angry that people didnt follow the bible and decided to scare or demand people follow it resulting in a angry holy text. There are many references to the bible in the Quran.

There is a fact that puzzles me, in the Quran it claimed the Ishmaul was going to be sacrificed but in the bible it says Isaac. If the bible was first then of course it must be true. Both texts indicate God is an all knowing entity and I would think he would not make a mistake like that which furthers my belief that muhammed was angry about the lack of faith and decided to create the Quran.

,religion,"Being an inclusive religion, Hinduism approaches the problems of atheism and agnosticism rather differently. Firstly, it regards them as view points, and secondly, it gives them an equal opportunity to present their case in its search for truth. It may be surprising for many to know that of the six schools of Hinduism, namely Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga and Purva Mimansa and Uttara Mimansa, the first five were originally atheistic or materialistic in their assertions about God or the cause of causes. They became theistic later under the growing influence of Brahmanism, Saivism and Vaishnavism. The ancient scholars of India condemned worldliness and materialism for their corrupting influence upon human character and spirituality, but accepted atheism and skepticism as valid arguments in the pursuit of truth. They acknowledged the existence of eternal, individual souls, but were ambivalent about the role of God in creation or causation.

Those early influences made Hinduism what it is today. While theism is its predominant theme and main driving force, it is more tolerant towards atheism, rationalism and materialism than the dogmatic religions. In its long historical growth that ran concurrent to the growth of human civilization and was facilitated mostly by human intellect, it has also broadened its philosophical base to include diverse views and multiple theories regarding the nature of existence and role of God. Currently, the theistic traditions of Hinduism hold the upper hand. Partly because of the influence exerted by centuries of Islamic rule and the British colonialism, many Hindus who follow the ritual practices and temple traditions show the same attitude as the believers of dogmatic religions towards atheists and agnostics and hold them in contempt as sinners and offenders of God. However for the intellectuals who possess the deeper knowledge of its philosophies and sectarian trends, atheism, materialism, and agnosticism represent at their best the stages in the spiritual evolution of embodied beings (jivas). Since human beings are prone to delusion and ignorance as intended by the law of creation, human beings cannot avoid making mistakes in their assertions and conclusions about metaphysical truths or the existence of transcendental reality.

Those who understand the deeper aspects of Hinduism, know that atheism and agnosticism are the natural states of human mind. At the time of birth, the soul knows the truth, but the human mind does not. It remains ignorant as intended by the principles of rebirth. Hence, everyone is born in this mortal world as an atheist or agnostic only, enveloped in ignorance and delusion which naturally predisposes them to atheism and agnosticism. Some carry it until the end, while some open their eyes during the journey and learn to see the truth. Hindu scriptures repeatedly affirm the illusory nature of our existence. People cannot perceive the truth of things, since they are enveloped in the impurities of Nature (Prakriti), which clog their minds and block their vision. They cease to be true seers, and fall into the trap of disbelief due to the impurities present in them and the influence of Maya. Under the influence of egoism (anava), attachments (bandha) and delusion (maya), they accept the real as unreal and the unreal as real.

Therefore, theoretically, in Hinduism nonbelievers are not held in contempt as evil or enemies of God. Atheism is the natural state of all. Everyone is born in a state of ignorance. Until people regain the knowledge of the Self and the idea of liberation through self-purification and inner awakening, they remain as animals (pasu), ignorant of their true selves (Pati) and their essential nature. When they become aware of their spiritual nature, and the spiritual nature of existence symbolized as God, it signals their second birth as the awakened humans with the potential to achieve liberation.

Thus, in Hinduism, the true faith of the sattvic kind, which arises in humans as part of their self-awakening, is the result of their second birth, which is considered their spiritual birth. This is the true meaning and significance of the concept of the twice born (dvija). The true believers are those who believe in their spiritual potential and the possibility of their union with God or their true Selves. They are the twice born (dvija), first in the body and next in the mind, not those who are simply born into a particular caste and may end up as materialists, secularists, or atheists to the core. Their first birth is the natural birth in the human body, and the second birth is the spiritual birth in the purity of their consciousness.

,religion,"So I'm in a bit of a ""valley of decision"" as of late and have been talking with an old, dear friend of mine. She is much older, has spent time in a monastery, and has a very fresh/new way of talking about faith than I've ever been used to especially living in flyover country in the US.

Essentially from what I can figure, she believes there are two paths (that depend on your previous life/fes) that each individual eventually goes through and they meet (though this part may take many lifetimes as well), and those are an energy based scientific side (the scientist being one who understands more and more about a general idea called energy, but what might be called information in today's lingo) and the mystic (one who is in One-Ment with the beloved and whom has a sense of One-Ness through the universe). We are having an ongoing discussion.

I know she also believes in a god/s, perhaps not a creator but definitely some beings that exist on different planes.

That seems to be the basics of what we've covered so far; my biggest obstacle in any kind of faith thus far in my life comes from a deep distrust of mainstream US religions having rejected them in college due to typical YEC bs. But this seems so far away from that and I can actually see myself believing in this very inclusive sort of rebirth cycle to eventually being on a different, positive plane. We also discussed karma which I am familiar with through some seeking in Eastern religious circles, but that no Hell is permanent (and possibly even no plane is permanent).

If you have any questions, I will be speaking with her tomorrow! The closest I can figure this coming from is some sort of esoteric Eastern faith, which very much interests me; the idea of mainstream religions honestly disgusts me, and I personally have been looking toward polytheism and energy/light/love much more in recent years.

I could go on.

I still do this day in and day out. I've even considered my politics and what denomination I would belong to based on them. I'm pro-choice and support LGBT rights. Yet if I joined a ""liberal"" denomination (i.e. PCUSA), I'd be called ""Not a Christian"" by people. Or maybe I become devout and convert to Catholicism. Then I'd be seen as supporting a system of oppression and violence from its leaders over millennia. Yeah, I'm pretty insecure too. 

Here's where I honestly stand: Do I think Jesus existed? Yes, I think there's sufficient evidence to say he did. Do I think Jesus died on the cross? Maybe; crucifixion was very common back then. Do I think he was divine and rose from the dead? Maybe. 50/50 chance he could have, but we'd need evidence to prove he did. Do I think there's a Heaven and Hell? Maybe, but I don't agree with the idea that you can only gain access if you have faith in Jesus and aren't just a virtuous person. Do I think God is actually present in the Sacrament? Unlikely. He'd make himself more apparent if he was. 

I could go on from there, but you get the idea. On the fence. I just want a clear direction from here so I can quit worrying about it all.

How do Christians know their God IS God? What about all the other faiths of the world? What makes Christianity so special?&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still do this day in and day out. I&amp;#39;ve even considered my politics and what denomination I would belong to based on them. I&amp;#39;m pro-choice and support LGBT rights. Yet if I joined a &amp;quot;liberal&amp;quot; denomination (i.e. PCUSA), I&amp;#39;d be called &amp;quot;Not a Christian&amp;quot; by people. Or maybe I become devout and convert to Catholicism. Then I&amp;#39;d be seen as supporting a system of oppression and violence from its leaders over millennia. Yeah, I&amp;#39;m pretty insecure too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where I honestly stand: Do I think Jesus existed? Yes, I think there&amp;#39;s sufficient evidence to say he did. Do I think Jesus died on the cross? Maybe; crucifixion was very common back then. Do I think he was divine and rose from the dead? Maybe. 50/50 chance he could have, but we&amp;#39;d need evidence to prove he did. Do I think there&amp;#39;s a Heaven and Hell? Maybe, but I don&amp;#39;t agree with the idea that you can only gain access if you have faith in Jesus and aren&amp;#39;t just a virtuous person. Do I think God is actually present in the Sacrament? Unlikely. He&amp;#39;d make himself more apparent if he was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on from there, but you get the idea. On the fence. I just want a clear direction from here so I can quit worrying about it all. I just want to know I made a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;
