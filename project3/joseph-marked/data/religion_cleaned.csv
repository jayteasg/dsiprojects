religion,Thoughts on R/athiesm after being unfairly banned.,"I find that sub is quite unfair and rude i stated my opinion without cursing or being agressive look at my post history, i was even told to ""screw off"" And then i was hit with a ban? i think they arent used to religious worshippers being logical in debates. From lurking there for a week i can summarize that sub as a ""feel good religious bashing circle jerk"" you could say ""what did you expect?"" Well considering athiests are meant to be enlightened i expected some moral values and decency on their behalf but it seems all athiests i come across are rude and arrogant

Athiesm is a joke or atleast that is the image i have formed after meeting and talking to many of them they hold a stigma towards religious people they look for the bad and not the good. ",1530109049.0

religion,"Everyone has Faith (Yes, even Atheists)","Hear me out. Everyone has faith in something, that they cannot prove is correct. To prove means it cannot be another way (like 100% certainty). We cannot prove God exists via a lab experiment.  In the same way, we cannot disprove God via a lab experiment. Due to scientific limitations, science cannot prove many things, such as how the universe started, or how the first cell came about, etc (even though there may be theories). People that believe science regarding this, are either having faith that A) science will figure out sometime in future how these things started (and that it wasn't by an intelligent mind) or B) have faith in the current scientific theories we have and that is enough to state ""there is no god"".  Either way, you're believing and having faith in something you cannot prove without a doubt.

Knowing your intelligence and awareness within this life it is much more likely your beingness draws from an intelligent and conscious source and you are likely part of it vs your beingness coming from some spontaneous dumb unaware thing.

religion,Reza Aslan's book is a polemic against Christianity,"Everyone seems to be gladhanding him, because they hate Fox News.  I am no fan of Fox News, but I have read the book.  And there is a lot of truth to their concerns.  If you're a Christian, you have a lot to be concerned with at this book.  Whether a fundamentalist or a liberal or anything in between.  Especially now that it is number 2 on the NY Times bestseller list.

This book is a serious polemic, first of all.  Though not in the mean-spirited sense, but in the methodical sense.  It is not just saying Jesus was a normal man nor just a gentle spiritual teacher. In fact, the latter is said to be completely false.  Nor will secularists come away liking Jesus very much.  The book also doesn't paint Jews very nicely.  Aslan makes certain that you understand how much Jews loved them some blood.

The book's premise is that Jesus was a Jewish revolutionary bent on destroying the Roman empire only and re-establishing Jewish control in Israel, and not the messiah as we understand it nor founder of a religion or even founder of a new sect of Judaism.  The whole religion of Christianity is a fraud designed later.  Jesus couldn't even read the Hebrew Bible and knew almost nothing about it, given that he was the lowest of the low in that society and couldn't possibly know how to read.  He goes on to say that all of the values of Christianity such as loving thy neighbor were only for other Jews and not universal, and that Jesus never said they were universal.  They were for peace between Jews, and not for universal brotherhood. Jesus also believed that violence was the only way to achieve 'the Kingdom of God' -- which was the end of the Roman empire, not an abstract spiritual peace. Most of the gospels are also said to be inaccurate and ahistorical.  He even says that the gospel writers had no concept of history at all, nor did anyone at that time.  They didn't care about facts but just made things up to 'reveal truth', such as making Jesus more in line with prophecy.  And even prophecy made no sense since all of it contradicts each other, and or is misunderstood as predicting the future instead speaking of contemporary events.  Aslan pretty much demolishes the whole religion of Christianity, gospels and all.  An impressive feat in 300 or so pages.

It is not certain whether he is promoting Islamic views or not, though.  One might see parallels between ancient Jews under Roman occupation and Hamas' current struggles against Zionism.  Though that is a secondary point to the polemic against Christian belief.  The book reads like a secularist attacking his former faith, and completely obliterating it.  (Aslan is a former evangelical, but he turned to Islam as an adult instead of becoming atheist). The Jesus in Islam was meant only for Israel and not universal.  He also was not son of God.  Both are themes of this book.  Mohammad was the universal prophet, and not Jesus.  So in some sense, the book is in line with Islamic views.  Muslims will find comfort in this book, and plenty of ammunition against Christians in religious debate.  I assume that he does not think the historical account is incompatible with Islam, or he wouldn't be a Muslim.  However, he has little respect for Christian belief.  The only thing that deviates from this theory of defending Islam, however, is the problem of his belief about the messiah.  Islam clearly states that Jesus was the messiah.  However, Aslan believes that Jesus was made the messiah through gospel writers lying about his birth place and other details.  This, funnily enough, will be used by atheists against both Muslims and Christians.  (Though Jews have been saying it for 2000 years).  And if he really believes Jesus was a fake ad hoc messiah, then it seems utterly ridiculous to believe in the Qu'ran or Islam.  Is the fake messiah still going to come on Judgment Day?  Especially the one that failed at his task the first time, and was just one of many fake messiahs?   I don't understand how some reconcile facts with religious belief.  Talk about cognitive dissonance.",1375194596.0

religion,"A shit-ton of empirical evidence and logically valid argumentation for gods for atheist to pretend doesn't exist :). (Or to refute, but that never happens)","**DEFINITION OF EVIDENCE:** the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.

**DEFINITION OF VALID ARGUMENT:** validity is the principle that if all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Also known as formal validity and valid argument

CONSCIOUSNESS AS AN ONTOLOGICAL PRIMITIVE: THE EXISTENCE OF GOD(S)

-	Consciousness is empirically proven to be ontologically distinct from matter. This can be shown by comparing the properties of both, such as minds being nonspacial and matter taking up space, the contents of mind being subjective and those of matter objective, the contents of mind private to the individual and those of matter accessible to anyone, the contents of mind being about things and the contents of matter lacking aboutness, and these are only a few examples. Anyone can test this at any time. For instance, the volume in a room your body takes up will be the same if you're actively consciously thinking or dead, there's no difference. Or that no matter who you love the most, they cannot actually access those feelings. [1]

-	Consciousness is an absolute certainty, it is the one thing we know directly and can be sure exists. The existence of the Self and Consciousness is an axiomatic fact, it must be true and cannot even be logically argued against without violating that same logic. Anything that is Not-Consciousness in known through Consciousness, including the material world, body, and brain. Anything you ever have or will know about matter relies on consciousness, and while consciousness cannot have its existence doubted [2-3], we can EASILY doubt matter (such as brain in a vat, solipsism, idealism, philosophical skepticism, etc.) [4-7]. To reduce what we know is 
axiomatically true and we know with direct certainty, into something we can doubt and never directly or certainly know, is height of unreasonable. 

-	Consciousness, even in less advanced beings like animals, comes with very specific traits. This includes being aware of the self and others to some extent, having needs and desires, seeking either social situations or isolation actively, emotions, and so forth.

-	CONCLUSION: since consciousness axiomatically exists, cannot be doubted, and is proven ontologically distinct from matter, consciousness must be a separate “substance” or “thing”, an ontological primitive. We know this primitive because we have direct access to it, so we can know about the nature of consciousness. An ontological primitive – something immaterial and eternal – which desires, has emotions, experiences, is self-aware, etc. is the best possible definition for a God. Therefore at least one God exists. 



THE NATURE/RISE OF CONSCIOUSNESS: THE INTERFERENCE FROM GOD(S)

-	Not only are the properties of consciousness mutually exclusive from those of matter, but what we see consciousness is capable of, at least in humans, does not line up with the deterministic, linearly moving, material universe. For instance the mind of humans can question, manipulate, and even go against this linear, deterministic matter. Questioning is proven in this very writing, we are stepping outside of the system and looking in to figure out how it works, something which, to our knowledge, no other life does. If it does they certainly and evidently don’t to the same extent. We can manipulate nature such as the creation of complex chemical medications, the harnessing of electricity itself, the building of mega-structures that stand the tests of time [8-9], not to mention devices such as what you’re reading this on which would never have grown in a consciousness-less nature. Contradiction of this material nature is scientifically proven in things such as Self-Regulation, Cognitive Therapy, and Placebos without Deception [10-12]. All of these prove that we can willfully recognize our deterministic patterns and freely choose to act differently. 

-	The rise of the higher consciousness possessed by humans is suspicious even if we ignore that this consciousness came to be able to contradict nature, and doesn’t fit with what we know about biological evolution. This is specifically in the Great Leap Forward of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution, a scientifically proven event well known in anthropology. Mankind went from “just another animal” to an abstractly questioning and thinking being. Art arose, religion, language, math, cultures, agriculture, and society and civilization themselves. This has never occurred to the same extent in another species, not even close. Further, there was no genetic change that occurred at this time, and biologically modern humans had already existed for over 100,000 years when the UPR happened![13-15]

-	CONCLUSION: The nature of consciousness the UPR birthed, along with the scientifically evidenced fact that it occurred abruptly and without biological evolution, suggest the interference of something outside of nature, i.e. a God. 




TELEOLOGY OF MIND AND BODY: THE PLAN OF GOD(S)

-	There is a Telos to the mind which was proven by psychological scientist Abraham Maslow in his Hierarchy of Needs. This shows the best path for human beings to follow in order to reach their ideal life, something that applies across times in cultures. Maslow showed that there is a “proper” hierarchy to human priorities, and a “proper” end-goal of Self-Actualization whatever that may before you. [16]

-	There is a Telos to the body which was proven by the Yale School of Medicine, especially through the works of Dr. Harold Burr. It shows that there are external fields creating and controlling, not simply produced by, the physical forms of all life. Anything from trees to amphibians to human beings. Readings of these “Life Fields” can predict cancer, ovulation, birth defects, and much more. Unfortunately Dr. Burr believed this to be evidence of an intelligent plan (it is…), so it has been largely swept under the rug in favor of (much more profitable!) materialism. [17-19]

-	CONCLUSION: There being a clear proper path for both all matter and consciousness shows that there is a Telos, or purpose, to human life and that we do not exist or evolve randomly. 




PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: DIRECT EXPERIENCES OF GOD(S)

-	Every single culture has experienced Gods. Hundreds of millions of people throughout human history and across cultures have experienced Gods, and these experiences have extremely similar characteristics. In fact these are so clear the can be categorized into 3 specific types of experiences (see Philosophy of Religion, and Introduction, by atheism William Rowe for example) [20]. Yes, the pantheons experienced seem to differ, but this is exactly what we would expect from cultures dependent on different geography, weather, economy, class system, and so forth. To say this shows the experiences are invalid would be like saying the stars don’t exist because cultures came up with different constellations. 

-	We also don’t inherently reject any human experience as delusion off the bat. We accept people experience pain, love, fear, happiness, depression, etc., despite never having actual access to their experiences. Yet when it comes to religious experiences many non-believers fall back on SPECIAL PLEADING, which is to judge this one type of experience differently from the rest. [21]

-	CONCLUSION: since we would expect gods to be interpreted differently by cultures, and without reasons to reject religious experiences (which would have to be on an individual basis, such as pain), all we have is something all cultures have consistent experienced across time, which parsimony would suggest means they actually experienced them. 





POLYTHEISM: MORE THAN ONE GOD

- There are experiences of all different gods throughout time, and so if one accepts experience (you have to without reasons specific to that individual case, such as intoxication or mental illness) they cannot say THEIR god is valid while others are not without SPECIAL PLEADING. 

- Monotheistic gods have been logically defeated, such as by the problem of evil, lack of miracles, lack of answered prayers, etc.

-	CONCLUSION: If you believe ANY gods exist, it is more reasonable to believe MANY do.

religion,We shouldn't ask God for evidence,"Asking for more evidence to believe in God defies the whole purpose of Earthly life.

If God were to prove himself and send angels to inform us of what the true form of faith is, it woudn't stop people who feel contempt towards God from feeling it, they would not want to worship Him suddenly. People who don't believe wouldn't be happy to find out they were wrong, they would still rather have a world without God.

Humans are here to be tested by their genuine actions and beliefs, they are free to pursue the reality they choose to adhere to and commit to it. They are free to disbelieve, pray to false deities, and even worship Satan.

More evidence would lead those people who don't like the idea of God to feel compelled to serve Him. Moreover, living in a world where God is a certainty would also hinder the free will of people who incline to commit evil, simply because that certainty would probably come with a very hefty price for wrongdoings, and therefore people would pretend to be good because they're afraid of consequences.

religion,Why does no one ever want to have a discussion.,"I'm an anti theist this means I believe that all religion is inherently harmful however whenever I discuss this topic was on anytime I bring up a point it is ignored.

If there's anyone reading this topic that would like to defend religion my belief stands on two important points.
 
 1 religion brings with it many divisive and immoral practices. not everyone who worships a given religion practices it in the same way and thus not everyone will bring with it the same negatives. However even at its most benign religious belief still causes some level of harm it would take far too long in a brief synopsis to go into the ways in which a light form of belief can negatively impact both an individual's life and Society however the time dedicated to this religious belief as well as a stepping stone that could be used for later generations to fall further into the rabbit hole are two points worth mentioning.
 
 2 well there are many benefits that can also come with religion every single benefit that can come from religious belief or a religious community can also be achieved through purely secularist means for instance a church could be replaced with a community center both would give a community a place to conjugate build communal bonds and do charity work.
 
It is for these reasons that I believe the position of auntie theist is the most reasonable one.
 
 Additionally it is irrational by definition to believe in any religion. The lack of any evidence for any religion should not be ignored. And thus atheism is the only rational position in my opinion. When you combine these two beliefs it should not be hard to see why I am an anti-theist.",1522099700.0
religion,Racism In Christianity,"With the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, I have some very concerned feelings to certain (NOT ALL) conservatives.

Namely, many Trump supporters are claiming to be Christian, yet support and enable his horrible policies that dehumanise people everyday. 

These same people also claim a general supremacy over others due to their skin colour. Here, I am just aiming to debunk a couple rumours. 

1. God created everyone in his image and likeness (Genesis). We here are all a part of the human race and we are all raised with love and support from our Heavenly Father. We are all as one, God does not discriminate against anybody as we are all his children. (This also can be seen with sexism, LGBT+ rights etc). A black man is just as worthy as a white man. Segregation or racism is not a part of God's will. 

2. We see many different languages being used throughout the Bible (Book of Acts). There is also a choir that sings eternal praise, that consists of all languages, tribes and ethnicities. 

3. Jesus disciples saw and praised diversity throughout the Bible. 

4. All forms of supremacy, whether they be racial, sexual etc, are an affront to God's will. Jesus died for all of us on the cross, not just the white people. Most importantly, he died for the sinners, the people that he normally would've hated. The people that killed him, the people that sentenced him to death. With that type of love, you expect him to be racially prejudiced?

5. Jesus himself was black, or dark skinned. Roses in Israel, bordering the continent of Africa and in the very hot Middle East, Jesus was definitely dark skinned. He also faced discrimination being from Nazareth (the poor and lowly neighbourhood).

Now I'm not just talking about Trump supporters. And I'm not just talking about Christianity. In any and all religions, love for everyone is preached. No one should be left behind for supremacy.

There are very few dangerous cults but virtually every religion and anti religion (atheist, and others) have extremists who could be classified as dangerous. Mostly because they try to gather followers on their ignorant hateful ideas. I have respect for all people who are respectful of someone who believes different from them. I have atheist friends mormon friends catholic friends and others.

For example I respect my atheist friends right to believe what he does. As well as my Mormon friend. And catholic. Some of the worlds worst cult leaders (hitler) started off with an ignorant hate for a groups innocent beliefs. I guess the true goal would be for people to have complete tolerance for harmless beliefs. Granted not all beliefs are harmless (al Qaeda). But for those who do not promote violence towards their fellow man I believe it is incorrect to classify whole groups as dangerous cults.

They have told me they had to flee from their countries and even from their families to save their lives. Once you were born a Muslim, you are forced to support Islam, no matter what, if you question, you can pay with your life.

It seems that there is a strong parallel with Nazism in that aspect. I'd love to hear some real testimonies or relevant opinions. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

I see you have opinions contradicting what I said. But statistics are scientifically the best thing we can trust to pursue the TRUTH.

Pew Research is one of the most reliable sources. Look at statistics from each country they present in the charts, sum the numbers and make the average:

* 60% of Muslims are in favor of making sharia the law of their country (average from 38 countries with enough sample)
* 50.75% of Muslims who support Sharia are in favor of stoning as a punishment for adultery. The worst is Pakistan with 89% (average from 20 countries with enough sample)
* 38.15% of Muslims support death for apostates. The worst is Egypt with 86% (average from 20 countries with enough sample)

Making it clear:

6 in every 10 Muslims worldwide are bound to support Sharia as the official law of their country (some indicate that this number is also high among Muslim migrants in Europe who support substituting Western laws for Sharia).

Half of all Muslims who support Sharia are bound to be in favor of stoning adulterers.

**4 in every 10 Muslims worldwide are bound to support death penalty for apostates. If you go to Egypt, almost 9 in every 10 Muslims will be in favor of killing you if you want to leave Islam.**

That's enough scientific sample to draw this conclusion: you can believe whatever you want, but in practice, death penalty for apostasy is a significant and scary part of Islam worldwide.

religion,There are people who believe Adam and Eve ate a literal fruit to piss God off.,"This is 5th grade interpretation of scripture.and this needs to stop! People claiming to have BA in religion studies are even pushing this 

Adam and Eve eating the fruit is symbolic of eating of a spiritual fruit. 

Man has the ability to channel their consicousness and beingness through self or God. Therefore eating of the tree God tells us not to is symbolic of allowing self to be our motive with no consideration for others or the whole which is representative of God.

The Bible starts off teaching us how free will works and the difference between good and evil and how we are our brothers keeper. Every man has to account for others because we are one in God's eyes. 

God man are one as well as man and man.

Even scripture tells us that we must lift up our serpent.. as Moses did as in lifting up his consicousness above self. And we meet God when that is done or rather have a oneness with God. And the eating of fruits and sowing what we reap is confirmation the fruit is not literal. 

The Bible is very spiritual it's not some literal mess pushed by the church and wannabe atheist Bible studiers.

 Faith can give you meaning in life and when you find that and you are happy then why should you be allowed to be told what you can and can't believe in.

I want to advise all people offended by the title that I'm neither against any of the groups represented in the 4-letter acronym, nor am I trying to harm you. This is simply one man's perspective as he's watched this question asked over and over.**

There's a consensus here whenever a religion refuses to affirm LGBT sexuality, identity and lifestyles that the religion in question is somehow being discriminatory. I'm here to refute that, and to try to inject **nuance** into a hot topic, as well as provide rationales. 

There's three points that I'm going to go over here:

1. The opportunity costs associated with both affirmation and non-affirmation (the latter of which is a variety of a positions)
2. What statistics say on the religiosity of homosexual and trans people
3. Conclusions founded on the two points, as well as briefly discussing my perspectives

I am again going to emphasize that by no means is any content here meant to dehumanize anyone. I'm taking the person, the individual out of the equation because it's impossible to account for anecdotes. The singular of data isn't anecdotes. Please keep that in mind.

**Opportunity Costs**

When a religious organization faces the question of to affirm or not to affirm, there's a lot of factors that should, but aren't always, considered. Here's some of them:

 * What are the current members of the organization going to think? How many potential members are they going to lose?
 * Is there a possibility of schism? 
 * What are the potential gains in members? What are the potential losses?
 * How will this affect the org's public image either way?

By declaring affirmation, an affirming organization will draw the ire and anger of the conservative and traditionalist wings in many cases, many of whom may oppose trying to use scripture, doctrine etc. to justify a person's actions, sexuality, identity, and more. Resentment may grow from both priests and laypeople in the organization. 

By not, the opportunity cost is primarily from potential members who would be turned off by this policy, whether they are LGBT themselves, or ""allies"" of LGBT. Liberal members may or may not leave in protest. 

Schism is an issue that's currently affecting the Methodist Church, and being reported on by several outlets, Reason.com among them: https://reason.com/2020/01/05/the-likely-outcome-of-the-methodist-schism/ so this isn't an idle threat. It's important to consider all parties. 

Public image is another thing to consider. In the last 20 years, the western world has decided to affirm the rights of same sex people to enter into unions/marriages, have their sexual acts legalized, etc. There's a general trend towards ending persecution of people who are homosexual, and I think few would honestly consider that a bad thing. There's concerns that not being LGBT affirming in some instances will make themselves seen as opposing these rights. 

My view, personally, on the above paragraph is that it's possible to support ending persecution of homosexuals, allowing same sex unions/marriage, and still be ""not-affirming"" as in, taking a position that doesn't try to justify their sexuality or lifestyle. However, this isn't about me, so I won't spend a lot of time, as you should **draw your own conclusions**

**Statistics**

Generally, the following statistics support the idea that LGBT people are very much less likely to be interested in religion. 

A [New Zealand study from 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20111008072403/http://lavenderislands.massey.ac.nz/downloads/Henrickson (2007) Lavender Faith.pdf) says that 73% of respondents in a sample size of 2269 for LGB (No T in this one) were unaffiliated.

[Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/24/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-americans-are-less-religious-than-straight-adults-by-traditional-measures/) in its latest study from 2014 stated that LGBT people were 12%, on average, less likely to believe in God, 23-26% less likely to attend religious services weekly and 15-17% less likely to pray daily. Other statistics are available in the link for further reading, I'm just highlighting for the purposes of brevity. 

[2013 Pew Research](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/chapter-6-religion/#religious-profile-of-the-lgbt-population) also found that 60% of LGBT people aged 18-29 are unaffiliated. The above source also writes:

&gt;LGBT adults also exhibit lower levels of religious commitment. Compared with the general public, fewer LGBT adults attend worship services regularly (13% attend at least weekly, compared with 37% of the general public). And religion tends to be less salient in the lives of LGBT respondents. A fifth (20%) of LGBT adults say that religion is very important in their lives, compared with roughly six-in-ten (59%) among the general public. - Pew Research 2013 Survey of LGBT Americans, Chapter 6

[Gallup Poll from 2014](https://news.gallup.com/poll/174788/lgbt-population-significantly-less-religious.aspx) also supports the above conclusions by Pew Research

The major point these all suggest is that affirming LGBT people may not bring in many new members, and may lead to more members leaving, especially if the overall consensus of an organization opposes affirmation. 

**Conclusions**

Nobody has the right answer here. I certainly don't, and I'm not claiming that LGBT exclusion is the better option. As I've stated, there's alternatives to the false dichotomy of affirming LGBT or telling them they're not welcome. 

My personal policy and view, as a practitioner of Shinto is: Welcome anyone of any ethnicity, sexuality, identity etc. into the community as long as they are respectful of boundaries and do not try to politicize it. In my case, the majority of people in the Shinto community, even our ""conservatives"" like myself are not opposed at a legal level to same sex marriage, and I personally can say, without speaking for anyone else that when it comes to trans people I don't understand them, like at all, but I do try to avoid passing judgment. I don't always like the LGBT community's politics, but when it comes to the individual it's important to not show any prejudice, especially to an individual coming forward with good intentions. 

I believe that, in my own religion, affirmation in the form of either trying to retroactively rewrite characters in history or stories as LGBT, trying to encourage kami being portrayed in these roles, or performing same sex marriage in Shinzen Kekkon as highly unacceptable. The latter is because our rituals are designed to bring children and create life. A same sex couple, and many types of trans relationships, close off that possibility entirely, so it would be unacceptable, but a heterosexual couple using birth control or with one or more partner being infertile, asexual etc. is not unacceptable. To affirm across most shinto beliefs would probably lead to more schisms and splits (the Shinto faith is not monolithic, and very diverse). 

The view of the Catholic church is that being homosexual isn't sinful, but that homosexual acts are sinful. Homosexuals are called to chastity; such persons must be accepted with respect and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. Their definition of discrimination that is unjust, however, is something that can't be [easily summarized](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19920724_homosexual-persons_en.html)

I'm not going to touch that much on protestant beliefs, but it's worth noting that the liberal PCUSA church has been on a steady decline since 1965, while the PCA has grown, from 2013 to 2017 nearly amassing 25,000 new members. [This source claims to have a graph showing the decline across several denominations](https://juicyecumenism.com/2019/09/25/mainline-protestantism-decline-continues/) - I have not been able to find the sources that they're using here. 

What I want to be taken away from here is that there's actual opportunity costs involved with what seems to some people like a trivial decision.

Some people think it's bad because religion doesn't evolve. I don't think so;  Religion evolves, but its purpose stays the same. That's the key.

Of course, religion needs a balance between dogma and spirituality, because this balance is escential for its success. If a religion is totally based on fear or dogma, it will not has the flexibility to stay many years.

Animals aren't even this cruel. This God's claim that he is ""Light, having in him no darkness"" is false on its face.","Point 1: God is love

&amp;#x200B;

1 John 4:8

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a famous verse, and very clear and simple: God is love, John says.

&amp;#x200B;

Had John read Paul's words in 1st Corinthians? Paul lays out a complete definition of what Biblical love actually is:

&amp;#x200B;

1 Corinthians 13:4

&amp;#x200B;

4  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it  is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it  is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not  delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects,  always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

&amp;#x200B;

So  how does God (that is, the same god who is described as love itself )  measure up to the description of love presented in (what is supposed to  be) his own word?

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see:

&gt;**Love is patient...**

&amp;#x200B;

God  continually lost his patience, especially with his own people. Some  might say that Israel repeatedly tested God's patience and got what was  coming to them, but how can the very God of the universe be provoked so  easily? Even the Bible says ""a day With the Lord a day is like a  thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day."" This would suggest  that 40 years in the desert or a few centuries of evil kings are barely  a blip on the timeline for the eternal God. Yet even during this minute  time period, God loses his patience constantly and lets puny man get  under his skin.

&amp;#x200B;

Deuteronomy 9:7a - Remember, do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness

&amp;#x200B;

Deuteronomy  31:29 - For I know that after my death you will act corruptly and turn  from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the  latter days, for you will do that which is evil in the sight of the  Lord, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands

&amp;#x200B;

2  Kings 22:17 - Because they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to  other gods that they might provoke Me to anger with all the work of  their hands, therefore My wrath burns against this place, and it shall  not be quenched.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel the need to post every instance of God being provoked, but he is provoked constantly.

&gt;**Love is kind...**

&amp;#x200B;

Jesus spoke often spoke insultingly to those closest to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Mark  4:39 - He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be  still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. He said to  his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?

&amp;#x200B;

Mark  7:17-18a - And when he had entered the house and left the people, his  disciples asked him about the parable. ""Are you so dull?"" he asked.

&amp;#x200B;

Matthew  16:21-23 - From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he  must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief  priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. And  Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from  you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.” But he turned and said to  Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me!""

&amp;#x200B;

Christ's  snarky comments aside, the very act of bringing man into existence was  unkind. According to the Bible, God has created a scenario where most of  his image bearers will burn forever in eternal fire. He made finding  Heaven impossibly hard and going to Hell easy. God planned from the  beginning everything that would happen - and his plan was that most  people Go to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Matthew  7:14-15 - Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is  easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.  Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life,  and there are few who find it

&gt;**It does not envy...**

God is bothered by any affection, praise or attention not directed toward him.

&amp;#x200B;

Exodus 34:11-14 - Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.

&amp;#x200B;

Matthew  10:27 - Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of  me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

&amp;#x200B;

""God  hates laughter and despises mirth. To feel free, untrammeled,   irresponsible, joyous,—to forget care and death—to be flooded with   sunshine without a fear of night—to forget the past, to have no thought   of the future, no dream of God, or heaven, or hell—to be intoxicated   with the present—to be conscious only of the clasp and kiss of the one   you love—this is the sin against the Holy Ghost."" --Robert G.

1  Chronicles 19:11 - Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and  the glory and the victory and the majesty, indeed everything that is in  the heavens and the earth; Yours is the dominion, O Lord, and You exalt  Yourself as head over all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**It does not dishonor others,**

&amp;#x200B;

God continually feels the need to belittle man and reiterate how puny, insufficient and disappointing he is.

&amp;#x200B;

Isaiah  64:6 - But we are all like an unclean thing, And all our  righteousnesses are like filthy rags; We all fade as a leaf, And our  iniquities, like the wind, Have taken us away.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**It is not self-seeking**

&amp;#x200B;

The  Bible says that God does whatever he wants, and does it for his own  glory. He demands others do everything for his glory too.

&amp;#x200B;

1 Corinthians 10:31 - So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

&amp;#x200B;

Psalm 115:3 - Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases.

Acts  12:23 - Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he  did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his  last.

&amp;#x200B;

Even  when God acts in a way that initially seems self-sacrificial, the Bible  is clear that he ultimately only does so for his own Glory.

&amp;#x200B;

Ephesians 1:12 - so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory.

&amp;#x200B;

Romans  3:25 - God put \[Christ\] forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be  received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his  divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.

&amp;#x200B;

it is not easily angered

&gt;**God is angered constantly, by infractions big and small.**

&amp;#x200B;

2  Samuel 6:6-7 - But when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon,  Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the  oxen nearly upset it. And the anger of the Lord burned against Uzzah,  and God struck him down there for his irreverence; and he died there by  the ark of God.

&amp;#x200B;

2  Samuel 24:1 - Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,  and he incited David against them, saying, “Go, number Israel and  Judah.”

&amp;#x200B;

Deuteronomy 9:22 - You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.

&amp;#x200B;

Psalm 7:11b - God is angry with the wicked every day

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**It keeps no record of wrongs**

&amp;#x200B;

God keeps a total and complete record of every wrong ever committed.

&amp;#x200B;

2  Corinthians 5:10 - For we must all appear before the judgment seat of  Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body,  according to what he has done, whether good or bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Colossians  3:25 - For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong  which he has done, and that without partiality.

&amp;#x200B;

Matthew 12:36 - I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak

&amp;#x200B;

Luke  8:17 - For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is  anything secret that will not be known and come to light.

&amp;#x200B;

Love does not delight in evil

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**We've  already established God does everything he wants to do and does it for  his own glory. Take note of the below events God decreed - for his own  glory:**

&amp;#x200B;

Isaiah  13:15-18 - Anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword.   Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes.   Their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking  hordes.  For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon, and no amount of  silver or gold will buy them off.  The attacking armies will shoot down  the young people with arrows.  They will have no mercy on helpless  babies and will show no compassion for the children.

&amp;#x200B;

Isaiah 45:7 - I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.

&amp;#x200B;

Leviticus  26:29 - then I will walk contrary to you in fury, and I myself will  discipline you sevenfold for your sins. You shall eat the flesh of your  sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.

&amp;#x200B;

It always protects...

&gt;**God does not always protect. God withdrew his protection many times from his own people to make a point.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jeremiah  15:4 - I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know,  for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jeremiah  16:13 - Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that  neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other  gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.

&amp;#x200B;

Deuteronomy  4:26-17 - I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day  that you will quickly perish from the land you are crossing the Jordan  to possess. You will not live long upon it, but will be utterly  destroyed. Then the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a  few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive  you.

&amp;#x200B;

Jeremiah  14:12 - Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they  offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I  will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence

&amp;#x200B;

Jeremiah  15:8 - Their widows will be increased to Me more than the sand of the  seas; I will bring against them, Against the mother of the young men, A  plunderer at noonday; I will cause anguish and terror to fall on them  suddenly.

&amp;#x200B;

***These  are only a handful of examples that prove God's character is often  shown to be in complete opposition to Paul's description of love.***

&amp;#x200B;

**To describe God as love itself is incorrect - not by my standard - but by the standard of the Bible itself.**

&amp;#x200B;

Point 2: God is merciful

&gt;**The Biblical God is the least merciful being in the cosmos**

&amp;#x200B;

“But You, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth.” Psalm 86:15.

&amp;#x200B;

“The  Lord is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and great in  mercy. The Lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His  works.” Psalm 145:8-9.

&amp;#x200B;

“For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.” James 2:13.

&amp;#x200B;

We  hear constantly about how merciful the Biblical God is supposed to be,  yet we witness elsewhere in the Bible and the rest of the world much  evidence to the contrary.

&amp;#x200B;

God  is not merciful to his creation. His creation is in pain constantly.  All of his creation experiences misery. All of his creation suffers  hunger, sadness, disaster, failing health, grief. All of his creation  inevitably experiences death (even the species that didn't sin!) None of  these concepts - pain, death, misery - had to exist at all, but God  decided to create a cosmos that contained them all in abundance. The  world, with its rape, death, torture, hunger, pain, stepping on Lego,  etc. - this was the world that the richly compassionate and merciful God  chose to speak into existence for his honor and glory. He could have  created a world entirely of puppies and marshmallows. Heck, he could  have created the exact same world we have now except without child  pornography - but no; God didn't feel those worlds would give him glory  quite like the child pornography containing world we have now.

&amp;#x200B;

God  is particularly unmerciful toward his image bearers; to you and me. He  seems to love pointing out that he has no reason to show us mercy at  all, and that when he does show some mercy, we should tell him how great  he is for it. Oh, but we're all dirty, rotten sinners after all, right?  We are owed no mercy, right? In the words of R.C. Sproul, ""These  creatures from the dirt have no right to tell a God he's too harsh.  What's wrong with you people!""

&amp;#x200B;

Well, what's ""wrong"" with us is that God wanted us to be wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

God  created his image bearers specifically to fail. The fall did not take  God by surprise. Unless God's plans can be thwarted (they can’t), man  could only have fallen into sin because God specifically planned they  would. We were ""brought forth in iniquity"" before we had any say in the  matter. Are we depraved because we chose to be? Because we were given  the choice not to be conceived in sin?

&amp;#x200B;

No.

&amp;#x200B;

We  are fallen, sinful, creatures destined to eternal punishment because  that's how the God who is ""rich in mercy"" created us. He wanted the vast  majority of us to fail, die, and burn in terrible pain forever and  ever. We know this because God's plans always come to fruition, and the  Bible tells us that most men will die and go to hell. This is the  merciful God's plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Of  all the realities God could have created, He created the one where men  were automatically imbued with a faulty, sin-prone nature they could  never resist, and he set up a law under which they would never succeed.  It pleased God to place his creation in unavoidable danger of fiery  torture forever, so that he could arbitrarily create a small few who  would escape for no other reason than to tell him how great he is for  it.

&amp;#x200B;

Matthew 7:14-15 - Enter by the  narrow  gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to   destruction, and those who enter by it are many. Because narrow is the   gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who   find it

Romans 9:22- What if God, desiring to  show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much  patience vessels of wrath **destined for destruction** \- **Romans 9:22**

Paul echoes the Proverb,

Proverbs 16:4- The LORD has made **everything for its own purpose**, Even the wicked for the **day of evil**.

Human beings are brought forth for the sole purpose of destruction and eternal torture.

Well,  that mercy is not impressive. That is an infinitely lower level of  mercy and compassion than all humans possess naturally. Animals aren't  even that cruel. Animals don't torture their prey forever. Animals don't  bring things to life specifically to torture them for their ""glory"" or  ""good pleasure."" To deliberately create a world where all of your  creation inevitably experiences terrible pain - some temporarily, most  eternally - is the least merciful thing imaginable. What could be less  merciful?

&amp;#x200B;

Point 3: There is no darkness in God

1 John 1:5 -- ""This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you: God is light, and in him there is **no darkness at all**.""

Darkness as in evil and falsehood.

Yet  in the Bible God has women raped,  children sacrificed alive in fire,  half a hundred  people slaughtered by bears for  making a joke, punishes  parents by  brainwashing them into murdering then  cannibalizing the  flesh of their own  children,  slices open the  stomachs of pregnant  mothers -- yanking out  and then  dashing their  babies to pieces, the  list goes on. All ordained  directly by the Lord. Satan  never does  these things in scripture, but God does. What is all this except the  pitch black darkness of death and evil?

Those 42 people that God had   slaughtered with 2 she-bears for making a joke about Elisha's bald spot,   do you think God extended this same mercy toward them?

**""He   said unto them, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good   to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you,  and  persecute you.""**

The   Bible constantly reminds us of the importance of self control, and to   not give way to anger.  It's interesting, the Bible says of God, ""He is   not a man"" that he should act like we human beings do, that is, in a   hypocritical manner in Numbers 23:19.  Well he could have fooled me, he   sure does give a  convincing performance. You would think that the only   being capable of total self control would show more self control. It  is  as God himself said, **""For they do not practice what they themselves preach"" (Matthew 23:3).** While at the same time demanding others to obey.

Also the Bible says of Satan, ""He is  the deceiver of the whole world"", yet in the Bible we see God doing just  that. Deceiving people for the purpose of damning them.

""Therefore  God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is  false, in order that all may be damned who did not believe the truth but  had pleasure in unrighteousness."" (2 Thess)

""Therefore  God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens the hearts  of other so they refuse to listen."" (Romans 9:18)

""For  this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says: “He  has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they cannot  see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I  would heal them.” (John 12:39-40)

Again  another instance of God hardening peoples hearts so that they cannot  believe and so be ""saved"", as he continually did with Pharaoh. Deceiving  them, making them believe lies for the purpose of damning them.",1600121677.0
religion,God was sitting in heaven...,"God was sitting in heaven one day when a scientist said to Him, “God, we don’t need you anymore. Science has finally figured out a way to create life out of nothing – in other words, we can now do what you did in the beginning.”

“Oh, is that so? Explain…” replies God. “Well,” says the scientist, “we can take dirt and form it into the likeness of you and breathe life into it, thus creating man.”

“Well, that’s very interesting… show Me.”

So the scientist bends down to the earth and starts to mold the soil into the shape of a man. Suddenly god interrupts “Wait, First get your own dirt.”

religion,"OMNISM: A religion where everyone is right, based off physics and psychology!","So, my best friend and I have a creative writing club with monthly prompts. This month's prompt is Explaining your Higher Power.... I thought you might enjoy reading it,.so here it is. Opinions and such are very welcomed.

here's a whack at our creative writing topic explaining your higher power.

Enstein said that the mark of true genius is the ability to explain complex Concepts in such a simple way that a child can understand it, that will be my goal here.
Where to begin? How about... I believe that almost all humans in the whole history of humans were on to something"" and had the right idea. I believe that almost all religions/ have life are simply different languages of trying to explain the same phenomenon: I call"" that thing that's out there"". That thing I'm talking about is humans attempts to understand the un-understandable stuff we can't really know for fact, probably until we die. At least in this current culture we simply do not have the technology required.

I could talk like literally forever about the cool new tech that is out there, so instead I will just say this:

Modern science is starting to uncover the math/physics behind all sorts of pseudoscience stuff! Like... Sacred geometry on a graph chart comes out as Paisley,fractals, and mandalas (when you look at the math behind trees and shit).

Some wacky scientists invented a camera that reads brain waves, uses math to translate that information into standard ""chakra/aura colors, and TOOK PICTURES of people who were literally dying, or ""crossing over into the unknown next realm"", all in attempts to capture a visual of the Soul meeting the body. It  worked, Google that shit!!

Also, physics nerds figured out a math equation to explain what dark matter is and how it works. Basically what they found out is that the ""solid laws of physics"" are 100% irrelevant inside a black holes and wormholes (which have dark matter in them). Dark matter has zero mass that takes up space. Math shows that if you were to jump into a black hole you would experience the literal equivalent of standing in a different universe! Time does not exist in black holes. Since you are in a place with zero matter, there is no way to say for example "" that cop has been sitting there for 5 minutes"". Once in a black hole, the math shows that you are experiencing what string theorists call "" viewing the sixth dimension"".(Google ""imagining the ten dimensions"" on YouTube).

simply put, us humans are stuck in the 3rd Dimension and see pieces of the fourth dimension. You know how cartoons are two-dimensional,  right? well, we are third dimensional beings....but there's ELEVEN DIMENSIONS!

So basically, black holes hold dark matter which means all sorts of wild shit goes down in there. since there is no time in there, you can most likely time travel or visit parallel universes t somehow using them, If we could fully understand what dark matter is all about. Hangar 26 at Area 51 has been messing with dark matter as an energy source for like 5 years now, at LEAST. think ""Back to the Future"". crazy scientist used a chemical (plutonium) that emits a bunch of raw, chaotic energy, and when he turns the car on, he controls where that energy goes. in that engine he created tiny wormholes and he uses speed (88 mph) to literally pick a time in the past or future and ""go there"".

Basically what I am trying to say is that a) time travel is possible just not in this current culture, and b) there math science that proves the existence of some mind-bogglingly cool religious stuff.

for example, they took the pineal gland (what hippies call your Third Eye) while it excretes a natural dose of DMT, and compared it to DMT from plants. they found out that 1) dMT is present in all living things and is responsible for religious stuff SO OFTEN that scientists call it ""the God Particle"", and 2) dMT is just the tip of the iceberg for a new math that makes sense of the well-known ""myth of God"".

** scientific facts to prove God really does exist!! wtf how awesome!**

Where am I going with this? Here's my point: Almost all religions want you to pray/meditate/ have an active relationship with God. well, when you do that stuff, you emit the same amount of DMT as you do when your soul leaves the body during death.

This new math, when you look at the big picture, proves that all religions are ""correct"" (scientifically, at least), or ""on the right track"". There is a word for this: 

OMNISM

Omnism is the belief that all religions have some truth to them, and that these omnibelievers do therefore believe in God. They also believe in what I call ""the religion of balance"".  That is another subject I can talk forever about but I will just say this:

To accurately Express infinity or the higher Dimensions through matter, you have to see the existence of all religions, PLUS see the exact opposite. That it's an equally valid point that there are also in fact zero correct religions, that god DOESN'T exist, and when we die we become fertilizer. Sounds hypocritical, but look at it this way:

While working in a hospital I witnessed a handful of near-death experiences. Jesus Freaks saw Jesus, sceptics saw a light at the end of the tunnel, athiests didn't see Jack shit. lol

so, my theory: drumroll please!

Whatever you believe in most throughout your life is what will happen to you when you die!

This is the perfect expression of infinity!! Christians say "" no matter how far you walk away from Jesus just turn around and he's right there"". I think they are trying to say that we will only experience as much God in this life as you allow yourself. Our brains are strong computers that analyze and interact with this world and the higher dimensions. What you believe in literally becomes a reality (for you at the very least!).

Consider the phrase ""I think therefore I am"". That is why Christians are trying to explain when they say "" we Are All God's Children, and you are special"". 

so, if all religions exist AND don't exist, I'm gonna choose my favorites to believe in.

that would be reincarnation and New Age Christianity.  

that way, as long as I ""walk in God's/higher power's  footsteps,"" I am set up to have a good life as Victoria, AND a good life in my next life too! Either that or I am reunited in heaven with all my friends and family, which ain't too bad either haha :p

food for thought:
1) matter/energy cannot be created or destroyed, so where does the energy go when we die??! according to the laws of physics, it has to go SOMEWHERE! 

2) ""I think therefore I am"": I think (for example) ""I'm a loser"", then I adhere to my lowered standard and  act like a loser, making it reality! our brain never stops emitting brain waves until we die, so while we are alive we are literally constantly influencing the reality of the universe with something as simple as merely thinking about moving a cup just one inch to the left.... the small decision to move the cup can trigger a series events that effects other people's lives. like, let's say you move the cup. later in the day, your roommate sits at the table, and because your cup is 1 "" closer to the edge, he knocks it off the table and it breaks, sending shards of glass into his hands when he tries to pick the pieces up. your little universe-altering decision to move the cup 1"" just landed your roommate in the emergency room, ruining his day and making him create resentments towards you, so he starts to treat you with less respect.  imagine the ghastly large amount of influence that a mere thought can provoke onto the universe around you!


3) Jesus is the walking representation of God, put on the earth to teach us how to live our lives in a Godly way, and show us that it IS in fact possible to do good in life and please God, to give us hope and motivation to try harder.

4) there is a universe exactly like the one we know, except in the other Universe humans can fly much like flying squirrels do! (and other strange imaginings of parallel universe).

5) bible Thumpers suddenly makes SO much more sense now!!!!!!

6): some people say that God planned everything about you in advance including everything you've done or will do. So even though it seems super important to be aware of the impact of your actions, DO NOT WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT TO THE POINT OF IT HINDERING YOUR PERFORMANCE. God knows what's up and ""has a plan for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future"" Jeremiah 29:11 (my life verse) 

7)hurt comes from the past,  worry comes from the future, and happiness comes from the now. We feel hurt when we remember/experience something that HAPPENED ( past tense) to us, worry is when you're extra nervous about what's gonna happen in the future. 

8) taoists and many other ancient Chinese ways of life explains that ""happiness dwells in the now"". so STOP WORRYING AND START TO FORGIVE those who hurt you so you can move the fuck on and finally feel happy!

If I was to say one last thing about this writing topic I would say this: to sum up these pages, I believe that a) god does exist, b) it is up to our use of free will to deserve heaven, c) everyone is right in some way about God, d) science is fucking rad, and most importantly e) only those who think through this shit, will experience feeling spiritually happy, so don't worry you already took the most important step. GO YOU!!",1588317999.0
religion,Why God of the books isn't really God.,"If God created all that is in the world, he would want you to be free. To learn and prosper. To enjoy the creation in all its beauty and glory. He or she wouldn't restrict you with a long set of mundane rules which are politically motivated or have a controlling agenda.

God is so forgiving and the most kind thing ever but will throw you into hell if you disobey him or challenge him? If he was strong, he wouldnt have created a hell or even spoke on a hell because apart of being strong is accepting the criticism, accepting that people will disobey, disbelieve and ridicule you. You don't go on a rant about how you will make people suffer because they don't listen to you. Even humans are strong enough to ignore and let opinions and beliefs of other be respected and wish the best for one another. But somehow.... God doesn't? God's going to torture you for eternity if you disobey him and don't do what he says.

God is too powerful to care about what you do in your bedroom. Or is he? This is to make one live in constant paranoia where they will be controlled like a puppet in fear that God (the almighty powerful strong and most amazing) will punish them for emptying their nuts out or enjoying some few minites pleasure out of this enslaved world where you live as a robot working 24/7 just to keep a pile of bricks sheltered over your head. 

Never has one even came close to spiritual experience by beleiving in the god of the books as much as one who takes a dmt trip and transcends themselves into the spiritual realms where they feel and see that this world and the truth is Love. God of the books isnt love. He is selfish, dictating, controlling, scare mongering, tyrantical, self obsorbed.......I mean why do you need to tell God constantly how great he is and thank him for everything you've got when a truthful person does things out of love and wishes to receive no praise or anything in return for their offerings? Really think about it...and before anyone says God don't need your praise, he absolutely does because otherwise, you're going to burn for eternity ain't you? Is God so insecure that he needs your praise? 

Are you really in love with God or are you just scared of the consequences of your actions in this life that you feel forced and helpless to the point that you need to believe and somehow love him? How can you love something that you've never seen, something you have no idea about apart from books. How can you feel for him? How can you take his word for it.

religion,Religion spreads more hatred than love/ TW: rape,"READ BEFORE DOWNVOTING!!!!

Obviously not all religions are the same. We can all agree that some christian 'subcultures' such as the Mormons are cults. However, I think all religions are cults and they spread more hatred than love. However, I will go in depth about christianity here because it personally affected me. 
92% of America are Christians. America is a country full of hatred because the left and right devide the nation in a horrific way; they have big problems with getting along with each others. It is proven that most Christian's are actually right winged. The right is considered to be the more pro-life side of politics. (Note: I cant get into another issue I have with the church because otherwise my post will be deleted: hint: 👬)  I think most people can agree with me on. 
Nothing wrong with being pro life but that's where things get difficult. You see, I am pro choice but I totally get and respect the pro life stance. I believe life starts at conception and that abortion is in an extent ending a life, however I still believe it's the womans choice. I was r*ped with 14 by my uncle and got an abortion. I had so many Christians come to me, saying Ill go to hell, I am a murderer. And yea it were always Christian's. Never atheists, jews, muslims etc. The second you harrass women who got an abortion is the second I can't accept your stance on it anymore. In terms of not supporting 👬 because of your religion I just dont think you can use your religion as an excuse for you not supporting those kind of people. 
I've been looking at a lot of conservative pages on Instagram that post about not supporting 👬, things about 👫 parades, calling women murderes even the ones that got raped as a minor and incest victims, etc. There is even this one church and priest who calls out for the genocide of all gays. What I've noticed in the past years that most, as I call them ""radical religious"" people spread more hatred than love. Because, there are indeed a lot of loving Christian's. However, I've never had one god loving Christian come to me supporting me for the abortion I had and what I went through. Now, if you're religious, I completely respect that you are.
But, don't go out and harrass other people who just live their lifes. I've been noticing so much hatred in them. Just look at people like Girl Defined or the transformed wife going on about ""no sex or even kissing before marriage, a woman has to stay at home and cook to please her husband, I love all people but I cant accept 👬 (which btw means you dont love all people). "" It's the 21st century we shouldnt live by outdated 'rules' someone who has never been proven to exist and use them to spread hatred. If you believe in god, that's amazing but pls, for the love of god, use it to spread love and not hatred.",1567195060.0

I attended catholic high school and yes, the definition of the belief according to the pope himself is LITERALLY. Sounds good, so running with this thought lets think about jesus; he was the human manifestation of the christian God. Human=Flesh and Flesh=meat. 

To an atheist or non Christian person, Transubstantiation does not occur and therefore the eucharist is bread. To a practicing and believing christian, transubstantiation occurs and the bread is literally flesh. To an agnostic person, or an individual who feels on the fence about Christianity and their belief in it and does believe in a God but cant quite pinpoint it (theres a million ways to describe being on the fence about God), theyre having a sandwich.

religion,My two cents on LGBT clergy in the Christian faith.,"I've been thinking about this topic quite a lot since this whole Methodist fiasco broke. I obviously have bias, being LGBT and Christian myself, but I would like to offer my opinion even so.

Homosexual intercourse is, without a doubt, a sin, according to passages within the traditionally canon New Testament. This is undeniable, and Christians who try to ignore it need to reconsider their way of thinking in regards to spiritual matters.

But, to be frank, who cares if a clergy member is committing a sin by engaging in homosexual intercourse? Are clergy members supposed to be free of sin? Where in any part of either the Old or New Testament is this said?Do non-LGBT clergy not sin in a myriad of other ways? Obviously, clergy should strive to be free of sin, but so should we all. No mortal is free of sin, by nature, so why are we expecting our clergy to be? The responsibility of clergy is not to be free of sin, but to guide our souls to Christ and to God.

There are many desires we let reign and things that we do that God does not command or condone. Just because He allows us to do it so as not to stifle our free will does not mean He condones it. Remember that God is a judge and will judge us on the Last Day. 

I see a lot of this thinking in this subreddit. Religion is like shopping for a new bag. There are people who encourage you to shop for whichever gods most suit your whims, desires and views. If that god does not condone my lifestyle then I'll just find another one, regardless of the truth. In our pride, we cannot possibly imagine that there's something wrong with us and instead think there must be something wrong with God for not condoning our desires and behaviors. 

But sometimes, our innermost desires and views are wrong and in opposition to God's. And the right thing to do is to repent of them, to fight them and deny them daily.

religion,"Christians: We do not hate you for theological reasons, we hate you for historical and political reasons.","Christian often ask why they are so strongly detested by Jews despite your professed love for Jews and Israel.

While this is true, this only explains why we disagree with Christianity, not why we hate Christians.

The truth is that we are not theologically obligated to hate Christians. The hatred toward Christians is largely a result of Judaism's long memory and unwillingness to forgive the oppression and discrimination meted out by Christians during the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Holocaust, and countless other travesties.

The other reason why Jews hate Christians so much is that most Jews are politically liberal, at least in the US and Europe, whereas most Christians are politically conservative.

religion,"Unism: A spiritual worldview which is patently anti-religious, and which has the potential to save humanity.","Unism

As humanity moves forward, religion becomes increasingly cumbersome and dangerous. Needless disagreements arise between people who harbor separate fantasies. Scientific and social progress is stifled because people choose to exist in various forms of mass delusion. The coexist movement attempts to shift the dialogue of religion towards one of peaceful acceptance. But what benefit does humanity get from peaceful acceptance of that which is false? For people to exist in a world where it is acceptable for them to believe false things can ONLY lead towards confusion, conflict, and, ultimately, war. Yes, extremists comprise a minority of religious people. However, it is this mass of religious people which enables the extremists. Humanity's collective acceptance of religion paves the way for them and reinforces their conviction that they are achieving glory. Moreover, extremism is only the furthest, most immediately reprehensible negative aspect of religion. More generally, religion encourages ignorance and stupidity.

Enter Unism.

Unism is a philosophy which emphasizes unity among all things and people on a deep spiritual level. This is a concept to be found in every religion. However, Unism is patently anti-religious (not anti-religion). A follower of Unism may follow tenets of the religions, however, a central tenet of Unism is that Unists have absolutely NO emotional ties or exclusive adherence to any specific religion. Unism teaches that it is the dogmatic adherence to religion which spoils said religion, and the person stuck on it. Dogmatic adherence is typically conjoined with a deep, unexplainable emotional need for the religion and/or its supreme deity. This pathology is precisely the type of thing Unism seeks to weed out of the garden of true spirituality.

Consciousness is all there is. The brain does not create consciousness. The brain *inhibits* consciousness. It does this by placing neurological parameters around it, forged though evolution, which create the illusion of being one specific being going through one specific timeline. A pure white light hitting a prism and refracting into all the different specific colors is akin to how pure infinite consciousness refracts through the prisms of our brains/bodies and becomes different specific people. The death of the biological brain is actually the dissolution of your limitations. Your consciousness expands. Your soul is recognized as the vast all-encompassing spiritual organism that it is.

Humans have the ability to exist in a sane, rational community if they agree on things which are true. The unfortunate reality of our current situation is that too many humans believe things which are not true. Religion, while deeply helpful in important spiritual ways, is also deeply harmful in that it promotes willful ignorance to facts. See: Evolution vs. Intelligent Design. At its worst, and in collusion with our inherently territorial animal psychology, it promotes violence. More generally, and even more insidiously than its insistence on things which are patently false, religion promotes an attitude of non-self-reliance. This goes against the very grain of who we are as refractions of infinite consciousness. The truth is within you if you are not too busy distrusting yourself and your instincts. If we all let this truth shine, imagine what we could accomplish collectively.

A Unist must continuously seek out the experience of a deep personal spiritual connection to the universe and to nature and to the infinite ebb of consciousness which connects all things. It is a lack of intimate personal connection to this vast ocean of mystery and wonder which makes people prone to ignorance and adherence to specific religions.

A Unist must take responsibility for their self. Unists cannot depend on a deity to save them from their own ignorance. It is their responsibility to climb out of that muck and find their own enlightenment. It is the dependence on specific deities of specific religions which deludes people into thinking they are right. This is, in fact, the exact moment in which they become wrong. Unists acknowledge and humbly accept their ignorance, always seeking to further their knowledge of science and philosophy.

A Unist should study other religions and understand that, when the religion rings true, it is speaking to universal truths. When a religion rings false, there can be any number of reasons why, including but not limited to: it was written in the context of previous mythologies which are lost on modern readers; it was written in the context of the times which are lost on modern readers; it was written with the intent of controlling the populace at the time; it was written for poetic or dramatic effect which is lost on modern readers; or it was written for some other reason which has nothing to do with spiritual enlightenment.

A Unist condemns adherence to a specific religion or deity, recognizing that it is this adherence which blinds a person to the truth. However, a Unist praises knowledge of religions and deities, recognizing that it is this knowledge which deepens a person's understanding of the truth.

Unists abhor willful ignorance which is why they are anti-religious. 

Unists recognize that there is life before and after death and that karma and reincarnation are, at the very least, quite strong possibilities. Therefore, Unists maintain a healthy respect for moral hygiene.

Unists not only meditate; they pray. Recognition of and communication with a higher consciousness is essential for Unists. To define this higher consciousness or to attempt to control it is blasphemy for Unists. It is this attempt to define and control what may best be described as ""God,"" which leads to religion.

Unists understand that humanity is mostly in the dark ages spiritually, which is why religion is so rampant, and that this is not likely to change any time soon. However, Unists attempt to maintain at least some semblance of hope that their example will be the ripple that eventually becomes a wave. If humanity were to just drop the falsehoods that they have carried since the dawn of time, things could be far more productive for us all. This is what a Unist dreams of for our future.

Unists respect atheists and agnostics. Atheists and agnostics have rightly perceived the downfalls of religion. However, they have replaced religious dogma with scientific dogma, or the belief that current world knowledge can suffice to explain reality. Or, they have the belief that spiritual reality (if it exists) is too incomprehensible to be understood in any meaningful way. These people would be better off (spiritually, mentally and emotionally) if they would accept Unism and its insistence on personal communion with infinite consciousness, or ""God."" However, Unists understand that not everyone is prepared for such openness, nor should such openness be forced. It must be personally sought. In the end, the Unist appreciates that at least the atheist or agnostic has prudently avoided being religious.",1447888100.0

I've been struggling with very deep depression and disappointment with certain aspects of my life. I begged him to come and help me, to tell me what I needed to do to straighten my life out. Of all the times I ever talked to him, this was probably the most clear and real. Here is what he told me: 

Respect God 

Respect The Creation (Earth)

Respect Others 

Respect Myself

He told me that there is no ""right religion,"" that he is not so petty to pick favorites. However, he told me that if I want to live a good life according to God, then I must live by strict rules. I can't drink alcohol because this violates ""respecting myself."" I should try to avoid foods with hormones and pesticides, to respect myself and the creation. He also told me that I shouldn't have sex before marriage because this was also disrespectful towards myself - that I am giving my body away to someone who isn't making a pact to take care of that body. (This is going to make things very hard for my boyfriend). 

But, he did tell me that humans have gotten a few things wrong in religion - that we believe that ""life is sacred"" instead of respecting the ""balance of life."" Therefore, some people try to have lots of babies and make their lives out of balance as a result. Instead, we need to venerate the balance of life by taking care of all the Earth's creatures, instead of promoting our own selfish human ends. 

He also told me he is okay with Gay marriage, as long as Gays don't have sex before marriage. 

The most important thing though is connecting to God through willpower. Willpower that respects the body, the people around you, the earth you live on, and the creator itself.

&gt;You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.

If the verse had stopped at ""not lie with a male"" the argument would have been entirely different, but even then, the verse would say ""You shall not lie with a male; it is an abomination."" – which woudn't even make sense (especially to women) as it is.

The core of the statment is ""as with a woman"" – which is clearly about a state of likedness to an act that is otherwise unapparent in how men have sex, and essentially exclusive to women. This is **anal penetration**.

While homophobes have used this verse to condemn homosexuality as a whole, pro gay people are avoiding and discrediting this verse in fear of justifying homophobia. But they're both wrong.

The verse is condemning a specific act, an act the Bible has shown elsewhere how inhumane and abusive it can be. It isn't about gay people, we all know that Sodom and Gomorrah weren't two big gay cities, they were rapists, they were married to women; they were, obviously and naturally, mostly straight men who did it to other men for sport.

Undermining the significance of the details of that story, and of the mentioned verse, has led to the a very effective manipulation of gay men, and their justified persecution to oblivion. Most gay men don't know that they're allowed to love, so they live their life in the closet, conditioned to hate themselves, fear people, and doubt God's mercy. Many openly gay men don't like anal, but have been conditioned to it in a community that is conveniently isolated and brainwashed, effectuating the cycle of homophobia by framing themselves for unnaturalness and suscepting themselves to STDs.

religion,"An Open Letter to the Undecided,"," Do you find yourself questioning the possibility that God even exists or how the world came into existence? Wouldn’t you agree that quite a few people believe that you can’t have faith without science and vice versa? 

What if you could use science to further faith? 

Let’s take a closer look at our world and how it came to be.

The leading explanation for the beginning of time is the [Big Bang Theory](https://www.universetoday.com/54756/what-is-the-big-bang-theory/) in which it states that the universe suddenly came into being with a great clash of planets and an

explosion of sound. Some simple cell organisms eventually evolved and over

millions and even billions of years, more complex forms emerged. 

Since our world has had enough **time** and **chance** to evolve into what it has become today, then the Big Bang Theory must be most logical reason for why we exist today.

How can we be so sure?

Scientists have found a way to estimate the ages of rocks, fossils, and the Earth with a technique called [Radiometric Dating](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/carbon-14/doesnt-carbon-14-dating-disprove-the-bible/). From this technique, scientists have come to the conclusion that the Earth is billions of years old.

Does this sound familiar to you?

The Founder of Radiometric Dating, Dr. Willard Libby, made an assumption that the ratio of 14C (unstable radioactive carbon) to 12C (stable isotope of carbon) in the atmosphere has always been the same as it is today ([1 to 1 trillion](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/carbon-14/doesnt-carbon-14-dating-disprove-the-bible/)) to determine the earth was billions of years old.

This ratio is also how the age of fossils is determined. 

However, according to Dr. Libby’s own findings, the atmosphere has **not** appeared to have reached full equilibrium. Meaning, there is an equal amount of radiation going out from the atmosphere as there is entering in from the sun.

You may ask what this has to do with determining the age of the earth, which is an insightful question. Allow me to explain.  

According to his calculations, if at the beginning of time there was no 14C in the atmosphere, it would take[ 30,000](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/carbon-14/doesnt-carbon-14-dating-disprove-the-bible/) years for it to reach a steady state.

Based on this finding that he chose to throw out as an anomaly, it shows that if our atmosphere has still not reached equilibrium, then the ratio of  14C /12C is not constant and the amount of 14C in the atmosphere is still **increasing**. Therefore, radiometric dating is **not accurate** because the ratio of 1 to 1 trillion has been changing and is going to change until the 30,000 years are up and our atmosphere has reached equilibrium. 

What do you think now that you know the man who created the Radiometric Dating system threw this important piece of information out of his work?

From this finding it could also be argued that the earth is not very old because according to Dr. Libby, the atmosphere has not reached a stable state of radiation, even though it takes 30,000 years, which we should have surpassed tenfold by now. 

It’s kind of ironic that the *founder* of Radiometric Dating discovered information that disproves his own theory don’t you think?

In retrospect,  every year, our Oceans accumulate vast amounts of salt from atmospheric and volcanic dust, glaciers, and rivers and amounts to be about[ 458 million tons of sodium](https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-for-creation/9-very-little-salt-in-the-sea/) each year. Only[ 27% or 122 million tons](https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-for-creation/9-very-little-salt-in-the-sea/) of that is removed annually by other natural causes.

Why does that matter you ask? Well if the world has been around for billions of years, then our oceans should be filled with **vastly more** salt than they are today.  

Another example is our[ moon](https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-for-creation/six-evidences-of-young-earth/). It spirals outwards very slowly away from earth, based on the gravitational pull it creates. This means that if the world was billions of years old, the moon would have had to have been **touching the earth** to start out with for it to be the[ 238,855 miles](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/) it is from our world today. 

Your conclusion from this information may be that if the evidence points to a young earth, then how was there enough time for simple organisms to evolve? 

The answer: there couldn't possibly have been.

Our bodies are made up of strands of DNA which contains all of  our genetic information. In fact, a single strand of DNA is a thousand times thinner than a strand of human hair and one pinhead of DNA has enough information in it to fill a stack of books stretching from the earth to the moon more than[ 500](https://creation.com/evolution-chance-and-creation) times.

In addition to that, the odds of  a single strand of DNA arranging itself in the correct

order to create life is[ 1 in 10\^400,000.](https://www.science20.com/philosophical_scientist/dna_probability_and_fallacy) To put this in perspective, it has about the same probability of you winning the lottery every day for **15 billion consecutive years**. That is just one strand of DNA. Our human body consists of about[ 4,600 trillion](http://infomory.com/numbers/number-of-dna-strands/) strands. This makes it

beyond impossible for our human bodies to have evolved by chance and time. 

This seriously questions how our universe came into existence by chance when even a single strand of chromosomes in the correct order is **statistically impossible**. 

I have shown you multiple instances where scientific evidence points towards a young Earth and an *intelligent designer*. The disconnect between faith and science has been bridged so one question remains. 

It takes faith to believe in God and it takes faith to believe that no gods exist, where is *your* faith going to rest? 

Sincerely,

A Believer",1572449465.0
religion,Atheism is an illogical standpoint. Hear me out. Read before you comment.,"Now I'm not a religious person by any means. I was raised catholic and the religion never really stuck. I don't believe that humans know what the true religion is, but there has to be a creator of some sort. A lot of people say that the universe has ""always existed"" but this statement is flawed in several ways. First of all is the fact that time and space are somewhat intertwined in existence. Saying that anything in the physical realm has always existed is breaking the second law of thermodynamics. And many people believe that the universe originated from the big bang, which is possible, but not against the actual belief in religion. What created the gasses that were dense enough to create the universe? Evolution is another common argument against the existence of a God. This is a standpoint that is not reinforced by any arguments or logic. Why does evolution occor? That mutation of DNA. How does the mutation of DNA happen? Through influence in the natural environment. But if that is the case what is the actual CAUSE of the DNA to mutate. The natural world isn't whispering in the DNA's ear telling it that it has to change to keep the cell alive. Science and religion go hand in hand. Now which religion is correct is a very difficult question to answer due to the fact that science can not measure the truth of the metaphysical world. For all we know a God created us and left us to go work on other projects. Like a model on a collectors shelf. But atheism itself is an illogical standpoint to take. Being agnostic is the way to go. Or even being religious if you think that the religion you're following is correct and that you can pursue the afterlife in your beliefs. I myself am unsure so choose to believe in none.

religion,There is such thing as too civil.,"Yes this is religious based. Why must society be overbearing “do this don’t do this, don’t hunt don’t handle dead animals...don’t you dare have an urge to kill (animals)” like shit this world is much different from where I have lived in. 

Where i lived before was deathly, to die yet be reborn was a blessing, to rip each other to shreds, for allies to fight to the death for dominance. As a predatory species, dragons, as well as hyennas, taurs, otters, or mustelid classed species, gryphons, manticores...they know death they know to hunt they know to kill, we do. We are allies yet we rip each other to shreds be it in a hunting ground or be it a more fair arena style fight we had only one rule. To kill each other, we must eat each other, applies with same species fights too. Only rules we creatures of chaos had was this, no killing kids, no adult on kid arena fights (both kids had to consent) as well as you better eat what you kill. Apart from humans killing us for sport and pissing us off their society went from the brutal romans (which was actually far tamer than my society) to the snowflakes of today, those who cry upon a death. Albeit this world is a limbo and no one really returns to this particular world after death, there is an afterlife. Hell religious people who bawl their eyes out are pathetic especially if they’re meat eaters. As a predatory animal i know life is sacred, yet at the same time I acknowledge I need to take life to live, furthermore when i become the prey, i am judged just like how I judged the animals I killed.

religion,The Báb—Manifestation of God,"To all who have come to honour the Herald of a new Dawn
  
Dearly loved Friends,
  
Consider with us. Whenever a divine Educator appears in the world, a Figure Whose teachings will come to shape human thought and action for centuries thereafter—at such a dramatic, seismic moment, what would we expect?
  
The appearance of every such Educator, as recorded in the Sacred Texts of the world’s great faiths, is a pivotal event that propels the advancement of civilization. The spiritual stimulus each has provided throughout history has enabled the radius of human cooperation to extend from the clan, to the tribe, to the city-state, and to the nation. And each of these great Teachers promised that, in time, another divine Figure would appear, Whose advent should be anticipated and Whose influence would reform the world. No wonder, then, that the coming of the Báb, Whose Birth two centuries ago we now honour, gave rise to unprecedented ferment in the country where He was born. The moment of His appearance, like the appearance of all such Figures, precipitated the release of powerful spiritual forces—but there was no accompanying spectacle. There was instead a late evening conversation, in a modest Persian dwelling, between a student of religion and his youthful Host, during which that Host revealed that He was the Promised One, the divine Educator His guest had been seeking. “Observe attentively,” He remarked, “Might not the Person intended … be none other than I?” It is this Youth, the Báb, that we acclaim as the One Whose coming—after an interval of a thousand years—shed the light of divine guidance once again upon the human world.
  
From this first moment unfolded all that has since come to pass. The Báb’s Writings flowed profusely from His pen, disclosing profound truths, dismissing superstitions that held sway in His day, urging the people to recognize the significance of the times, castigating the hypocrisy of their leaders, and summoning the world to an exalted standard of conduct. “O peoples of the earth!” He declares in one of His major works, “Verily the resplendent Light of God hath appeared in your midst … that ye may be guided aright to the ways of peace and, by the leave of God, step out of the darkness into the light and onto this far-extended Path of Truth.” His influence spread with extraordinary rapidity, reaching beyond the limits of Persia. Observers were astonished alike by the fast-swelling numbers of His followers and by their deeds of unsurpassed bravery and devotion. Accounts of the Báb’s life—the swift arc it traced and the tragic drama that ended it—induced curious souls to travel to Persia and investigate further, and inspired a range of artistic tributes to His Person.
  
The brilliance of the light of the Báb seems the more dazzling when set against the darkness of the social milieu in which He appeared. Nineteenth-century Persia was far removed from its glory days when its civilization was the envy of the world. Ignorance now prevailed; senseless dogmas went unchallenged; inequality was fuelled by rampant corruption. Religion, the foundation of Persia’s former prosperity, had become a body devoid of its animating spirit. Each succeeding year offered the subjugated masses only disillusionment and hopelessness. Oppression was complete. Then, like a spring storm, the Báb came to purge and purify, to uproot the withered and spent customs of a wayward age, and to wash away the obscuring dust from the eyes of those blinded by illusion. But the Báb had a special object in view. He sought to prepare people for the imminent appearance of Bahá’u’lláh—the second of the Twin Luminaries destined to bring new light to humankind. This was His most insistent theme. “When the Daystar of Bahá will shine resplendent above the horizon of eternity”, He instructed His followers, “it is incumbent upon you to present yourselves before His Throne.”
  
Thus did the Báb and, with even greater splendour, Bahá’u’lláh illuminate a society and an age shrouded in darkness. They inaugurated a new stage in social evolution: the stage of the unification of the entire human family. The spiritual energies They released into the world infused a new life into every sphere of endeavour, the results of which are evident in the transformation that has occurred. Material civilization has advanced immeasurably; astounding breakthroughs in science and technology have been achieved; the gates to the accumulated knowledge of humanity have been flung open. And principles set out by Bahá’u’lláh for the upliftment and progress of society and for ending systems of domination and exclusion have come to be widely accepted. Consider His teaching that humanity is one people, or that women are equal with men, or that education must be universal, or that rational investigation of the truth must prevail over fanciful theories and prejudices. Across all nations, a large segment of the world’s people now agrees with these fundamental values.
  
Nevertheless, arguments against these values, previously confined to the margins of serious thought, are also resurgent in society—a reminder that ideals require the force of spiritual commitment to cement them. For it is one thing to acknowledge something in principle; it is quite another to embrace it with all of one’s heart, and harder still to refashion society in ways that give collective expression to it. Yet this is the aim of communities emerging across the globe that are patterned on Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings. These communities are striving to focus the light of those teachings on the chronic problems that afflict the societies around them; they are devising programmes of practical action centred on spiritual precepts. These are communities that champion the education of both girls and boys under all circumstances; that subscribe to an expanded conception of worship which includes work carried out in the spirit of service; that look to spiritual aspirations, rather than self-interest, as the ever-flowing springs of motivation; and that inculcate a resolve to advance individual and social transformation. They seek to bring about spiritual, social, and material progress simultaneously. Above all, these are communities that define themselves by their commitment to the oneness of humanity. They value the rich diversity represented by all the world’s kindreds, while maintaining that one’s identity as a member of the human race has precedence before other identities and associations. They affirm the need for a global consciousness, arising from a shared concern for the well-being of humankind, and they count all the peoples of the earth as spiritual brothers and sisters. Not content with simply belonging to such communities, Bahá’u’lláh’s followers are making constant effort to invite like-minded souls to join them in learning how to put His teachings into effect.
  
This brings us to the crux of our case. The matter at hand is a challenging one, and requires candour. There are many noble and admirable causes in the world, and they arise from particular perspectives, each with its own merit. Is the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh merely one amongst them? Or is it universal, embodying the highest ideals of all humanity? After all, a Cause that is to be the wellspring of enduring justice and peace—not for one place or one people, but for all places and all peoples—must be inexhaustible, must possess a heavenly vitality that allows it to transcend all limitations and encompass every dimension of the life of humanity. Ultimately, it must have the power to transform the human heart. Then let us, like the Báb’s guest, observe attentively. Does not the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh possess these very qualities?
  
If the teachings brought by Bahá’u’lláh are what will enable humanity to advance to the highest levels of unity, then one must search the soul for the right response. The multitudes who recognized the Báb were summoned to heroism, and their magnificent response is recorded by history. Let every one who is awake to the condition of the world, and to the persistent evils that warp the lives of its inhabitants, heed Bahá’u’lláh’s call to selfless and steadfast service—heroism for the present age. What else will rescue the world but the efforts of countless souls who each make the welfare of humanity their principal, their dominating concern?

religion,Satan vs God - who's really the bad guy?,"I'll begin by saying I have not always felt this way, I have grown into this belief and am just wondering what others think. In my younger years I was so moved by what I thought was the Holy Spirit that I accepted Christ into my life. I felt that I had been born again and I was a hardcore teenage bible beater! The older I grew, the more I learned, the less and less I began to believe. 

While I have a hard time believing in a god, I have little trouble believing in the Devil. But not the Devil that god would have people believe in. 
What I have come to believe is that if there is, indeed, a god and a devil...their roles have been reversed and many people are trusting in the wrong deity. 

To the winner goes the spoils and also the ability to write history. Just think if the Nazis had won? What would history books say?  Say, for arguments sake, that christians are at least correct about the existence of god and the Devil and demons and angels...OK..so, god and the Devil had it out. The Devil lost and was banished to rule over Hell for all eternity. Many Christians will tell you that God, through human vessels, wrote the Bible. If God, through humans, wrote the Bible, who is to say if what he wrote is fact, fiction, or something in-between? 

God put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. In which was planted the tree of knowledge. But then he forbade Adam and Eve to eat of the fruit so that they would not know good from evil, truth from lies, etc. Why? Why would he want to hide that knowledge from them? The only person who you would think would like to hide something like that would be the evil one...I mean, really. So, in comes Lucifer. He sees that God isn’t sharing his knowledge with the humans he created, he feels compassion for these humans, and bam! I don’t see how Lucifer did anything but give humans the ability to see. To see right from wrong, to see themselves for what they are. He opened their eyes in a way that God wouldn’t. If you look at it like that, God seems like the ‘bad guy’ and Lucifer kinda seems like the good guy. No, he really sounds like the good guy. Maybe he just got a bad wrap. Everyone assumes that the Devil is evil, but doesn’t the Devil punishes evil. Lucifer doesn’t create, condone, cause evil. He punishes those who are evil. 

Humans are evil. At least some humans have evil in their hearts and in their souls, and this evil is punished by Lucifer. When people do evil things they say ‘the Devil made me do it’. People in church blame Satan for a ‘war for our souls’ that is happening in a spiritual realm right now. He just becomes a scapegoat whom they can blame for all bad things that happen. It isn’t Lucifer’s fault that people kill one another. It isn’t Lucifer’s fault that people hate and steal and rape and murder. It is the fault of the human mind and heart. Lucifer justly doles out punishment to those who give into evil thoughts and ways. 

Personally, I like the idea of a much more translucent, open deity. A deity that doesn’t want to keep us in the dark. And a deity that punishes the wicked and doesn’t try to claim that ‘all sin is equal’ because I’m sorry, but torturing/killing someone is not equal to lying to get out of work for a day.

Can’t wait to hear everyone’s thoughts, comments. I don’t know all that much about all this stuff, so I won’t be offended by alternate views or corrections to my thought process/logic.

religion,"Which is more important? Freedom of Religion, or separation of Church and State?  ","Now, I may be religiously and politically out of my league as I am no expert of either, but to my simple yet question-filled mind it seems as though the two cannot co-exist. 

Freedom of Religion implies you are free to practice whatever religion however you please, as long as it doesn't impose on another person's rights. This, however, causes government interference by protecting religions from other religions, honoring religious holidays and events, and making places of worship available for religious institutions. This results in non-separation of Church and State.

If true separation of Church and State were practiced, then some religions would not have the means to be practiced, and would be unable to survive monetarily, giving some people no TRUE choice in which religion to be a part of, resulting in the non-Freedom of Religion.

With that being said, I do think here in the US there is a somewhat balance of these two, but it only works because (soapbox moment) the government is so tied into religion that the separation of Church and State is viewed as something COMPLETELY different than what I believe the founding fathers actually wanted.

religion,The Creation Story,"The creation story from the Bible is mocked, yet, based on what science currently offers, remarkably accurate as creation stories go. Christians should not mock scientists for what they discover, but embrace at least the raw data. We’re after the truth, after all. Jesus did not mock human wisdom discovering truth around us, saying, “When you see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway you say, ‘A shower is coming’, and so it is. And when you see the south wind blow, you say, ‘There will be heat’; and it comes to pass. "". What He questioned about our wisdom was our inability to discern “love your enemies”, which is our ability to see God. He also said, “You do not hear my words because my words have no place within you.” Therefore, some scientists refuse Him and find that refusal in all that they can see.

There are a few points about the creation story in the Bible that are fuzzy, if taking science to be accurate, but science, the further back, is fuzzy and changing constantly. Using what science offers in the early Universe, the Bible version appears to have a few things wrong, yet in the more recent history of life, it has some remarkably accurate placement of events, according to science and within my bias -- I can see God through Christ. The issue of the “fourth day” in the story seems to be problematic, but aside from that, this story is remarkable when viewed from scientific offerings.

For a story about the whole creation process to be right, it would have to have been given to an early prophet who would be describing how it was shown to him (or her), and as Jesus taught us, the truth from God is offered in parables, “that seeing you might see and not perceive, and hearing you might hear, and not understand”. Science refuses a coming judgement and He lets them. He reveals the Truth to whom He will.

The author of the Bible’s Creation Story could not have been an eye-witness to what happened. If it is accurate then it was accurate before science could contribute to it. If only a few things are accurate, then it is likely coincidence. If most of it is right, then there is reason to wonder. If it is accurate, then it is evidence that the story in the Bible came from someone who witnessed it, which would have to be God.

This being said, based on science, there are a few offerings from the Creation Story that would not be right. The Bible story says that birds showed up during the time when animals were only in the ocean and after plants covered the dry land. The fossil record would seem to refute that, but only if we are talking about birds as we know it. The writer describes seeing fowl. But, if God was showing him the introduction of flight into life, then the Bible story agrees exactly with science as to when that happened. Science says that insects were the first to take flight and that they were out on land while the rest of life, from which we came, was still in the sea.

Other than that, there is the “fourth day” in the Creation Story. The mention of “morning and evening” of each day seems to be stages of the creation, not single rotations of the earth. The fourth day introduces the sun and moon which would define morning and evening as we know it. Science knows these things didn’t happen in seven rotations of the earth, and, I offer, so did Jesus. Peter bore witness.

The Creation Story begins saying “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. and the earth was without form and void.” After that light was added. Today, under the influence of Einstein, science can agree that in the beginning everything here today in the Universe was there then, just not yet. This is important in light of what Peter wrote about this story. For science, time is just a dimension of space, on which we are at a certain position right now. It is a postulation from Relativity that Einstein called Block Universe. Time “is”. Today “is”. Yesterday “is”. Tomorrow “is”. God said to Moses, “Tell them ‘I am’ has sent you.” Jesus said, “Before Abraham was, I am”. They were both offering that they exist in a different perspective, one not subject to time. In the beginning, the earth, the stars, the sun, the moon and us were already there, but without form and void, no body and no life. Yet, we already existed, were planned out, sitting in our place in the dimension of time. Jesus told us, “Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.” For science, Einstein’s “proven” postulations would have to be found in any Creation Story for them to be moved. Yet even it it were, Jesus said, “They will not believe though one rose from the dead”, because they cannot hear “love your enemies”, which may required seeing God and seeing past the barrier of death.

Jesus surely touched on this connection in the Creation Story while here, though it was not recorded in the gospels. The truth that the Creation Story is tied to Relativity is expressed in the writings of His apostle Peter. Thanks to science, we can see what Peter was told in a most profound way. Peter turned in his writings to the Creation Story and set us up to have a strength to resist the denials of science. He wrote about the Creation Story and then added, “Remember this one thing, with God, a day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years is as one day.” Time is relative and God exits in a different perspective than flesh to look upon it. Unlike us, He is not subject to it. Even science says that time is a very feature of our Universe. God does not disagree. Jesus promise, “I will not leave you comfortless”, and they use this discovery to mock our faith. Peter made this discover a very part of this ancient prophecy, from surely an ancient vision.

In the Creation Story, between the earth being without form and void, it says, “and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.” These words in the prophecy turn out to be the difficult using scientific theory, but this is a very brief summary and a parable. Which came first in the Universe, water or light? According to science, light, so there is a place they can mock. In the vastness of time, science says, together and about the same time. Science believes that early short lived stars would have been needed to create the oxygen required for water to form. Not long ago, science was teaching us that an abundance of water came billions of years after the first stars, but recent observations have moved them to now say less than a billion years after the bang. They were so sure, until they weren’t. Observation required revision. In fact, observations in young molecular clouds let to the realization that concentrations of water back then could have been about what they are now. For science, a requirement of even an extremely brief summary of the creation of life better have a strong focus on water and sun light.

Science discovered the existence of a “hum” everywhere in space and call it The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. They theorize that it is the remnant of the first light in our Universe, a great flash. There was already a theory about such a flash, so they pinned this discover to it. They might be right, but what this really offers is that there was a great flash somewhere in our past. If it was what they believe remains in question. If it is seen now, billions of years later and faint, the same in all directions, then the Universe had to be already very very large when the flash happened. They theorize that this light came from the early “stuff” of the Universe, when no objects had taken form yet so the stuff was already equally distributed in the already vastness of our Universe. They devised a theory to solve the problem of how the Universe could already be so big when this happened and now refuse anything that refuses that theory, because it “explains everything that is today so nicely”.

This remnant is their advent of light in the Universe, and it sure seems to be. They place it in the right place in history within the Biblical Creation Story, when the “stuff” was without form and void, as seen within my bias. I do struggle with the wording “the face of the waters”, but again, this is a parable to a prophet who knew nothing of these things and we would not know either for many thousands of years. This is a summary focused on the coming of life. It is, after all, a story about earth and the life we see. This is a story about us, that we were planned from the beginning of time and that things aren’t just what the flesh sees and confirms, a cross baring witness.

Science says that after the earth formed it grew to size and was hot. It eventually formed an atmosphere, sky. This sky reached a stage that it was full of water in the form of vapor, because of the heat. As the earth cooled the vapor began to condense and rained down onto the earth’s surface as liquid water. According to science, this process eventually created one big ocean covering the earth. This theory from science seems to confirm the progression found in the Creation Story. It reports that after light was added, a next major step for life on earth was water and an atmosphere. It calls it sky.

The Bible also reports that this water existed below the sky and above it. This entry in the story sounds like a clear overview of science’s condensation period, and in the correct order. Since science holds the condensation period to be the birth of the oceans, then science concurs with the Bible. Science would likely maintain that a summary of the creation, however brief, would have to convey information about the importance of the oceans, even when and how. Science would have to admit that during this long rain period, the oceans existed on the surface and in the sky. The creation story from the Bible states it like this, “And God said, ‘Let an expanse be in the midst of the waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.’ And God made the expanse, and it separated between the waters which are under the expanse, and the waters which are above the expanse"" That is what science reports, and in the right place in history. The waters that would eventually become our oceans where once throughout the atmosphere and the expanse (sky) appeared out of the “midst” of it. Liquid below and vapor above.

The Bible and science continue to concur on the order of things, both stating that after this there was just ocean covering the surface of the earth, no visible land. The Bible reports that land appeared next, out of the water, and the land “divided the ocean into seas”. This is another critical event in the advent of life that would have to be included in an accurate summary, and it is. Science agrees that after the water condensation period the world was one big ocean, but soon land appeared. Data suggests that molten rocks of different densities moving sank or floated in the heated body of earth. Along with volcanic activity, this dynamic soon breached the surface of the waters and became dry land.

The Bible reports that vegetation then covered the land, with no mention of animals. The fossil records report some life forms on land at this point, but, I read on one website, “compared to the spread of vegetation, it was negligible”, and that it had little or nothing to do with the life we know today. It reports that these “animals” were a dead end. Science concurs again with the Bible saying that animal life began first in the sea and that was followed by animal life appearing on land. Then, mankind.

This Bible story is a fairly reasonable condensed summary of the creation of earth and of the life we know, according to science, so far. Being that it was given to an ancient prophet who understood none of these things, and that it was propagated for who knows how long before recorded, and maybe altered after that before reaching us in the dimensions of time, it is astonishingly accurate.

Because a few have attacked my understanding of science, instead of trying to answer all individually, I suggest anyone google this offerings for yourself. 

I am scientifically trained in the discipline of physics (many years ago but no PHD) and data analysis. For the last 35 years I have worked in application development and data analysis. A few years ago, my interest flared again for science when I was given subscriptions to 3 science magazines (one of which was Scientific American). I have read every issue cover-to-cover since. After years of this, one day, not long ago, I re-read the Creation Story in the Bible. When I did, I recognized some things. I decided to write a paper and this posting is a excerpt.

As for the science, if you want to google stuff for yourself, here are some starters:

Early Earth:

https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130266-early-earth-was-covered-in-a-global-ocean-and-had-no-mountains/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological\_history\_of\_Earth

Earth was initially molten due to extreme [volcanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism) and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)) when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with the Earth. [Outgassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing) and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor), augmented by ice delivered from [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet), [produced the oceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth). 

As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. 

https://earthsky.org/earth/when-earths-continents-rose-above-its-oceans

Bottom line: A study led by geochemist Bruno Dhuime of the University of Bristol in England suggests Earth’s thick continental crust – the land under our feet – may have risen from the oceans half a billion years earlier than scientists previously thought, or 3 billion years ago

First Vegetation on dry land 470 to 500mya 

[https://newatlas.com/earliest-land-plants/53472/](https://newatlas.com/earliest-land-plants/53472/)

Most of what we know about the deep history of life on Earth comes from fossils, and according to that record, plants migrated from the sea onto land about 420 million years ago. But the story told by those dusty old rocks is patchy at best. New research led by the University of Bristol has wound back the evolutionary clock to determine that plants likely invaded dry land much earlier, about 500 million years ago.

400mya insects

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution\_of\_insects

Evolution has produced astonishing variety in insects. Pictured are some of the possible shapes of [antennae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(biology)).

The most recent understanding of the **evolution of insects** is based on studies of the following branches of science: molecular biology, insect morphology, paleontology, insect taxonomy, evolution, embryology, bioinformatics and scientific computing. It is estimated that the class of [insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect) originated on Earth about 480 million years ago, in the [Ordovician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician), at about the same time [terrestrial plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_plant) appeared.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_insects#cite_note-:0-1) Insects evolved from a group of [crustaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_insects#cite_note-2) The first insects were land bound, but about 400 million years ago in the [Devonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian) period one lineage of insects evolved flight, the first animals to do so.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_insects#cite_note-:0-1) The oldest insect fossil has been proposed to be [*Rhyniognatha hirsti*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyniognatha_hirsti), estimated to be 400 million years old, but the insect identity of the fossil has been contested.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_insects#cite_note-Haug_C.,_Haug_J._T._(2017).-3) Global climate conditions changed several times during the history of Earth, and along with it the [diversity of insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_of_insects). The [Pterygotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygotes) (winged insects) underwent a major [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_radiation) in the [Carboniferous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous) (356 to 299 million years ago) while the [Endopterygota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endopterygota) (insects that go through different life stages with [metamorphosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis)) underwent another major radiation in the [Permian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian) (299 to 252 million years ago).

(This one is interesting, the author likewise must have seen a connection to The Creation Story)

Around 530 million years ago, there is evidence [that centipede-like animals began to explore the world above water](http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/earth_sciences/report-9641.html). Somewhere around 430 million years ago, plants and colonized the bare earth, creating a land rich in food and resources, while fish evolved from ancestral vertebrates in the sea. It was another 30 million years before those [prehistoric fish crawled out of the water](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/01/06/fossil-footprints-show-animals-adventured-onto-land-earlier-than-thought/) and began the evolutionary lineage we sit atop today. To understand life as we know it, we have to look back at where we came from, and understand how our ancestors braved a brand new world above the waves. 

Life that led to us today began in the sea starting about 541mya and remained only in the sea for millions of years

Life left the sea and crawled unto land 440mya

religion,"To Most Muslims: If you are against homosexuals/homosexuality, then there is no way your version of Islam can be the truth, period.","In order to adhere to the idea that homosexual marriage / homosexuality as a sexual attraction is forbidden/evil, you would have to adhere to the idea that not all human beings have the right to lawful partners and romantic relationships, which through basic logic and reason, is sheer corruption of the human race. To prevent consenting adults from exercising their right and natural desires to be romantically engaged with a partner (just like God expects heterosexual people to get into lawful relationships), is following the footsteps of satan, division, and discord.

You are essentially preventing people from satisfying their right to love and also sexual satisfaction. If God allows heterosexual people to love and be loved, then it would be cruel, unjust, and ridiculous for God to prevent gay people to do the same.

All human beings, through our biological natures as God created us, have desires. God never once told humans that we have to suppress every single one of these desires. No, God allows humans to satisfy their various desires, urges, and wants, but through lawful means.

Sexual and romantic desires are among many desires of humans, and it would be unjust for God to allow one portion of humanity to satisfy them properly and leave out another portion completely. The only people in the world today that are against the idea of gays/lesbians being able to freely love whom they want are the Westboro Baptist Church types and the extremist/radical Islamist types of the middle east, among many other countless extreme conservative Christian/Muslim/religious folks scattered across the world.

Many of these people also believe in conspiracy theories and other ridiculous nonsense that has no place in modern science and rationalism.

It is pretty clear that regardless of what religion you follow or what background you have, it's possible that with a slight twist, you can easily turn into one of these extremist types.

Whoever you are, if you adhere to these ideas that homosexuals do NOT have the God-given right to marry people whom they love, despite their attraction being different, then you have a serious illness that can never be cured unless God Himself wills.

I myself used to think that homosexuals were evil and homosexuality was a ""sin"" years ago. I was forced to change my beliefs because it contradicted reason, nothing more. I realized that if I was following a true faith given by God, it can NEVER contradict reason.

Homophobia contradicts reason. No amount of religious bigotry from anyone can change that. If you believe Allah actually thinks or teaches that homosexuality is evil/forbidden, then unfortunately, that is a god I cannot or ever worship, since this god created homosexuality, not just in humans, but in hundreds of animal species, then has the audacity to prevent them from simply loving each other lawfully.

Fortunately, Allah is not such a ruthless god.

-----

The Qur'an states that one of God's signs is the existence of love and attraction between two mates. There is no mention of it being specifically between a male or female, but just two mates.

**30;21:** - *And of His signs is that He created for you from among yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you love and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.*

God claims that there are *signs* in the existence of love and mercy between two people, that they are able to love each other to a point where they feel joy, happiness, and tranquility, and this reality is simply a sign for people who reflect and give thought.

It is a reality that two people who feel romantic love for each other can be of any gender, whether male/female, male/male, or female/female. The gender is not important, only the love is. People can argue all day about whether this is normal/abnormal or natural/unnatural, but that doesn't negate this basic fact that this phenomenon exists.

So with all that said, anyone who denies the legitimacy of two males or two females legitimately in love with each other are simply denying one of God's signs.

-----

Allah's deen is simple, not complicated. Human beings make it complicated, human beings turn it into something ridiculous, like an inclusive cult where only certain types of humans are permitted and the rest are either outcast or severely restricted. That's not how God's deen works.

Whether you are a heterosexual, homosexual, asexual, bisexual, that is how God created you. You have the God-given right to marry whomever you like, granted you are of age, and you marry someone lawfully, and not commit transgression. Committing adultery/cheating is transgression.

People mix a normal sexuality with actual transgression like adultery, which the Qur'an makes no short mention of, and also lays out punishment for it.

There are no punishments detailed for anything like homosexuality: https://lampofislam.wordpress.com/2018/07/30/the-quran-doesnt-penalize-homosexuality

A God who literally torments his followers and ruins their lives to prove their faith (ie Job)

A God who believes anyone who disagrees with him should suffer for eternity (ie hell)

A God responsible for endless hatred and war (ie the crusades, homophobia, etc)

A God who made us a certain way then said that natural way is evil and in need of saving (ie the 7 deadly sins) [or who knew we'd fall and become sinful]

A God who punished us for seeking knowledge (ie the garden)

A God who would force his own son to suffer horrendously for a problem he could snap his fingers and fix (the crucifixion)

religion,For those who like to say the Quran is just a copy of the former books such as the bible...,"If a person looks at the Quran with an open heart and mind, it is clear that the Quran is not a copy of the bible but a rectification. This is obvious if one has knowledge of both books, those who say that it’s a copy and that the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) copied the bible and made the Quran, haven’t read the Quran with sincerity. One of the big reasons a lot of Christians come to islam is because there are so many things in the bible that don’t make sense, that contradict each other, and when they come to the Quran and see the way it’s described in the Quran, they have the feeling of “ohhh now it makes sense”. Some examples being.

* The bible says god rested on the seventh day. While the Quran says

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
Allah! There is no God but He,
the Living, the Self-subsisting, the Eternal.
**No slumber can seize Him, nor sleep.**
All things in heaven and earth are His.
Who could intercede in His presence without His permission?
He knows what appears in front of and behind His creatures.
Nor can they encompass any knowledge of Him except what he wills.
His throne extends over the heavens and the earth,
and **He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them,**
for He is the Highest and Most Exalted.

The bible says god created man in his own image. And this is a reason that a lot of atheist mock religion. They think we believe in a man in the clouds, looking down on us. However, the Quran says, there is nothing like God. We cannot picture nor comprehend him, and he is not like any of his creation in likeness.

[He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He multiplies you thereby. *There is nothing like unto Him*, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
(42:11)


* The bible says that someone had to die on a cross for our sins. How does that make sense? Islam says, no one died or can die for our sins. What a person has to do is ask god for forgiveness directly and he will forgive you. Which makes perfect sense. Why would someone have to die for our sins? I know there’s a philosophy behind it that people love to say and repeat, of god loving mankind so much that he sent his only son and etc, etc. but the matter of the fact is, it makes no sense and all it is, is that it sounds good to people, it appeals to their emotions rather than their logic. What makes sense is if we sin and we ask god for forgiveness directly for our sins.

“Indeed Allah loves those who repent and purify themselves.“ [Surah Al Baqarah, 2:222]

“Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Surah Az-Zumar 39:53)

* The bible says Satan was a fallen angel. The Quran says the Satan was not a fallen angel. The angels can’t disobey god as they have no free will. What iblees (Satan) was, was a jinn, which is a creation like humans, but they were created before humans. Humans are made of clay while they are made of fire.

* The bible says god begot a son. Glory be to god! How can this be? How can god beget a son. And how it makes sense to people is beyond me. They say that Jesus was god. Yet the Quran says

The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. **They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.**
(5:75)

This whole idea of the trinity makes no sense. What makes perfect sense is this idea of one god.

* The bible says most of the prophets and messengers were sinners and bad people in general, going so far as to call some of them drunkards, while islam says these were among the best of people, Noah , Abraham, Solomon, moses, etc. Which makes so much more sense. 

* Christians say doing good or bad doesn’t mean much in terms of what happens to a person in the afterlife, what’s important is belief. That heaven is not earned by works.  While in Islam it is both belief and god deeds and avoiding sins. Does this idea of having each good deed you do written for you and each bad deed you do written for you and on the day of judgment weighed not make more sense? We believe Muslims who are bad can also end up in hell. Deeds play a big part, a person has to lead a good life. They can’t just say we believe on their tongue and that’s it. 

Do the people think that they will be left to say, ""We believe"" and they will not be tried?
But We have certainly tried those before them, and Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars.
(29:2-3)

* The bible talks about original sin. How we inherited the sins of Adam and Eve. While in Islam it says no one can inherit anyone’s sins. Every person is held accountable for their own good and bad. Honestly which one makes more sense?

I died on a cross and you've got souvenirs celebrating the event as if it was a home run baseball or something. That's how I died, I don't want my death to be celebrated; it was painful - I had nothing to do with the means by which I died (the cross), so why worship it? So if I died in an Iron Maiden, that would be around your neck instead?

I just don't want Jesus to feel threatened/scared or have a PTSD episode when he comes back and sees us all celebrating his impalement upon the cross. It's VERY creepy. Put yourself in his shoes, how would you feel? Is it merely because there wasn't anything else to symbolize his great deeds during life? For instance, we couldn't find a way to put his healing on a necklace or a-top a church? Or changing water to wine? Why not breaking bread? That would seem to be a good symbol and asthetic as well.

If I saw people with my image breaking bread, I would understand completely that it was being worn in love for me and my love for others.

religion,Religion is a necessary evolutionary step. Its purpose beeing to transport knowledge of beneficial behavioral patterns across time through stories. Therefore Religion is misunderstood since thousends of years by the majority of ppl.,"\---if this does not belong here - iam sorry.---

We can see this today in chimps (how it might have started millions of years ago).

The strongest chimp maybe becomes the leader of the group, but if he is a tyrant, he wont stay very long.  Because if he is, 2 chimps with 2/3 of his strength will tare him to pieces when he is not prepared. so not the strongest chimp, but a strong chimp who is also very cooperative forms the most stable society.

Millions of years ago humans developed a way to transport this kind of knowledge (""dont be a dick, help your community"") with stories in form of imagery and later language. And with this, the first form of morality was born (dont do what you want and fuck up who u like, be humble and help others) which later developed in what we call today religion.

okay i need to edit this to address ""god"" and put it in the misunderstood basked:  
"" 

damn i wish i would have added this to the op or could answer to everyone at once...

i also think that ""god"" as an entity to believe in is misunderstood from us.

originally god was ""just"" a mythological kategory for a ""wholesome"" set of principles and values (i dont know all the values and principles in there tho, i think no one does?).

its like in every other creation myth where the god's are categories of behaviour so to speak. if you put that in writing and transport those writing over thousends of years i think its just natural to be misinterpreted when said writings are full of  
metaphorical truths (which is necessary because metaphorical texts have a much higher density of knowledge which they can transport to future generations).

religion,Christians don't have shit on lesbians," 

So this is kind of a rant, but i will try and prevent walls of text.

There are a few things that most Christians get wrong when talking about Homosexuality, from a semi-christian perspective.

1. The bible makes it ABUNDANTLY clear that homosexuality is only a sin when it is between two men.
2. every single verse regarding homosexuality in its pure form never mentions women.
3. most verses on homosexuality differ GREATLY from the same verses in earlier versions of the same text.
4. Homosexuality was legal for the majority of the old testament until the specific verses were changed during (most likely) the later parts of the old testament, or sometime during the middle ages.
5. Female homosexuality existed during biblical times. (this was due to the fact that polygamy was rampant and because people had 5 or more wives, they definitely slept together when there husband was not around, or if there husband wanted them to)

There is more on this topic but i will save it for a later post...

religion,Atheism is a Proposition,"[Atheism and Agnosticism - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#DefiAthe)

""“Atheism” is typically defined in terms of “theism”. Theism, in turn, is best understood as a proposition—something that is either true or false. It is often defined as “the belief that God exists”, but here “belief” means “something believed”. It refers to the propositional content of belief, not to the attitude or psychological state of believing. This is why it makes sense to say that theism is true or false and to argue for or against theism. If, however, “atheism” is defined in terms of theism and theism is the proposition that God exists and not the psychological condition of believing that there is a God, then it follows that atheism is not the absence of the psychological condition of believing that God exists (more on this below). The “a-” in “atheism” must be understood as negation instead of absence, as “not” instead of “without”. Therefore, in philosophy at least, atheism should be construed as the proposition that God does not exist (or, more broadly, the proposition that there are no gods).

This definition has the added virtue of making atheism a direct answer to one of the most important metaphysical questions in philosophy of religion, namely, “Is there a God?” There are only two possible direct answers to this question: “yes”, which is theism, and “no”, which is atheism. Answers like “I don’t know”, “no one knows”, “I don’t care”, “an affirmative answer has never been established”, or “the question is meaningless” are not directanswers to this question.""

This is a very clear explanation of why atheism is, indeed, a position. It's not simply a psychological state, it's a metaphysical view that the unvierse is absent gods, opposed to theism being 1+ existing god. Further, atheism doesn't exist in a vaccuum. The second you get to morality, epistemology, materialism, and so on the more defense the position needs.

In no other cases do we accept a position that does not need defense and support, so why do some do so with atheism? Even worse, why not just defend your atheism if you can?

A great example is being told ""you don't need to defend/support being an abigfootist."" That's ... That's not true. If you think Bigfoot is fiction you need reason to think so or we shouldn't seriously consider your position. For instance - ""I don't believe because the video evidence was shown to be a man in a monkey suit"". That's a reason one can defend for holding their position. If you disagree, please share other positions outside of atheism that one can accept without reasons or evidence. Can anyone claim any position for any reason and it should be accepted, or is it special pleading?

Why do I think atheism has taken to this? Burden of proof games. The idea that any position can be accepted without needing to support it is absurd and dangerous. There is no ""burden of proof,"" anyone who has a position needs to defend it. Ask yourself: if you don't have evidence and arguments to believe something, and can't / aren't willing to defend it... Is it really a worthwhile position?",1535826272.0

3. Regarding the teleological arguments, we also see division not union. Even at the level of mindless nature it is a constant battle - atoms combining, rocks colliding, galaxies eating each other, predator and prey. If it is ordered it seems clearly ordered by dynamically different forces.

religion,Is Christianity a bad religion?,"First of all, this isn’t a shitpost. There’s lots of things about Christianity that irk me, and I feel like other members of this subreddit also feel the same way.

First of all, Christianity spread less like a religion, and more like a disease. It wasn’t spread peacefully where people could adhere to it if they wanted to, it was forced onto them. When Christianity was introduced to the mesoamerican people, they brushed it off, and not in a malevolent manner. As a result, the Spaniards attempting to spread the religion attacked the people and slaughtered hundreds of innocent people.

Deities of Pagan and Norse religion were literally demonized and made into evil creatures that feared the “great” and “mighty” Christian God. That’s literally like brainwashing if you ask me, painting their deities out to be evil, but the Christian God to be good. You never hear anything about Buddhists massacring villages because they won’t listen to the way of Buddha.

And then there was the whole satanic panic fiasco in the 80’s. D&amp;amp;D (a game that stimulates the imagination of the players) was becoming popular, and since it features creatures from religions Christianity destroyed I guess that made it bad. If you’re unaware, D&amp;amp;D is basically just a board game where the players use their imagination to fill in the gaps, that’s it.

religion,Why Jesus/Yahushua cannot be the Jewish Messiah,"Number 1 - the most abominable concept in the Tanak is the concept of human sacrifice. The Jewish Messiah would never ever be a human sacrifice, and no matter how allegorical or metaphorical he was trying to be, the Jewish Messiah would never use the words ""unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, etc. etc."" In fact saying something like that would pretty much ensure that the Jewish people reject you...

Number 2 - there are no proof texts that exist in the Tanakh for Jesus's life, death or supposed Resurrection. as you stated they are intentional mistranslations or text taken completely out of context.
The verse in the Psalms that reads ""kiss the son lest he be angry"", actually reads in the Hebrew, ""yearn for purity lest he be angry"", and how does one yearn for purity? By striving the best of one's ability to live by Torah aka ""the Law"". As (Tehilim)Psalm 119 reads, ""the law is perfect restoring the soul.""
The verse in the Psalms that supposedly reads ""my hands and my feet they have pierced"", actually reads in the original Hebrew Lo ahri, ""they are at my hands and feet like a lion""
Also if Yehsyahu(Isaiah) is read in context without the artificial chapter break, it quickly becomes clear that Isaiah 53 is not about Jesus, but about corporate Israel. Corporate Israel is referred to in the singular as a single servant countless times in the tanakh and in the chapters preceding and following Isaiah 53. 

Number 3 - Pretty much all of the supposed proof texts for Jesus have to do with his death and Resurrection, In the New testament Jesus asks his followers who they think he is, to which they reply, ""You are the Messiah"". Immediately following this the New testament tells us that Jesus began from that point forward to reveal and show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things. So the question is? if Jesus didn't teach them that he was going to have to be put to death and resurrected until after they believed in him as the Messiah, then what texts were they relating him to in the Tanakh that made them believe that he was the Messiah? Because at that point he had not fulfilled nor done one single thing written about the coming messiah in the Tanakh. It is a widely taught and understood thing in Israel today and was even in the day of Jesus that miracles we're not proof that anyone was a prophet or from God. to this day Jesus has still not fulfilled one single prophecy written about the Messiah that was/is to come in the Tanak. 

Number 4 - Christians and the New testament are guilty of the very things that they accuse the Jews of doing, creating their own commandments or meaning for them and making the commandments of God of no effect. Paul writes in one of his letters, ""so it is written, you shall not muzzle an ox while it treads the grain. Is it oxen God is concerned with?"" so Paul on his own authority has now decided that God has no care for the right treatment of animals and that the commandment that God gave and was followed for over three thousand years it's now obviously not about what it clearly states. it's about paying your pastor or this or that... This is complete Insanity!!!!

Number 5 - Christians in the New testament claim that ""without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness for sins"". There is a big problem with this concept and Christianity / Pauline christology is dependent upon this belief that, without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins. However nowhere is it taught within Judaism that sacrifices are not required for forgiveness. Even the Talmud, the foundation of all Orthodox Judaism, teaches that the only requirement for forgiveness of sin before God is to Teshuva(Repentance). 

Number 5 - Christianity also rests on the belief that in order to be righteous one must live a life completely free of sin never having made one mistake in accordance with the law in one's life. This is not what the Tanakh teaches. Ezekiel clearly states that if a man turns from his way of wickedness (Teshuva), and does his best to keep the commandments of God that his past sins will be remembered no more and he will be considered righteous. Job was considered perfect and upright in his generation. Do you think that Job never committed a single sin in his life? Of course not. Yet he is still called perfect and upright....

Number 6 - the Tanakh clearly speaks of a day when the Messiah will return, build the temple, restore the sacrifices, and teach the Torah (Law). The Tanakh even states that the new Temple will have water that flows from it into the salt sea and make it fresh. Yet the New testament in Revelation tells us that when the Messiah returns and makes all things new that there will be no sea. This in itself is a major conflict between the Tanakh and the New testament.

Number 7 - I could go on and on, I can talk about how the gospel stories do not match one another in grotesque ways. I could talk about the fact that Matthew whom supposedly wrote that Jesus rode on the top of two donkeys at the same time, thus proving the authors attempt to create a story in which Jesus fulfilled a prophecy according to the writer's own literal understanding of the passage and not their actual eye witness accounts.
    Christianity is merely the rebranding of Babylonian paganism. They celebrate all of the same holidays as the Babylonian pagans, their Messiah is born on the same day as tammuz and the winter solstice, they cut down and decorate trees when Jeremiah chapter 10 specifically condemns the practice of placing a tree in one's house and decorating it with silver and gold.
   Jesus died with the words eli eli lama sabachthani, my God my God why have you forsaken me, on his lips because he realized in the time of his death that he was not who he believed to be and that God was not going to save him. 

If you ever have time, research ""Sabatai Zvi'. There have been tons of false Messiah's.

I'm going to leave you all with a little bit of a mystery and if you desired to know the aswer and search for it as silver and search for it as though it were a hidden treasure, you'll figure out what I'm saying.

The only mention of blasphemy in the Quran is when God instructs Muslims [not to insult other religions gods.](https://quran.com/6/108-118?translations=20) 

The Hadiths, however... 

&gt; **“From Ibn ‘Abbaas (ra) who said: A blind man had a female slave who had borne him a child (Umm Walad) who reviled the Prophet** **ﷺ** **and disparaged him, and he told her not to do that but she did not stop, and he rebuked her but she paid no heed. One night she started to disparage and revile the Prophet** **ﷺ, so he took a dagger and put it in her stomach and pressed on it and killed her. There fell between her legs a child who was smeared with the blood that was there. The next morning mention of that was made to the Prophet** **ﷺ** **and he assembled the people and said: “I adjure by Allah the man who did this to stand up.” The blind man stood up and came through the people, trembling, and he came and sat before the Prophet** **ﷺ. He said: O Messenger of Allah, I am the one who did it. She used to revile you and disparage you, and I told her not to do it but she did not stop, and I rebuked her but she paid no heed. I have two sons from her who are like two pearls, and she was good to me. Last night she started to revile you and disparage you, and I took a dagger and placed it on her stomach and I pressed on it until I killed her. The Prophet** **ﷺ** **said: “Bear witness that no retaliation is due for her blood.”** \[Narrated by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa’ie and Ahmad used it as his argument\] 

And this isn't the only Hadith calling for death for trivial things such as making fun of Muhammad. The Hadiths are a horror show of violence from stoning to pedophilia and, as France proves, directly responsible for inspiring terrorism. 

Before the Sunni and Shia try to cite Quran verses about those who[""mocked the Prophet"" ](https://legacy.quran.com/9/65-66)are doomed to hell, reread them, and carefully.

""Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.” (Matthew 5:17)

“It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid.” (Luke 16:17)

I know that for some, it can be a hard pill to swallow. But God doesn't change, his law doesn't change. The God who sent plagues and demanded the sacrifice of sons and allows multiple wives is still ""up-to-date"" and relevant.

However, how Muslims pick and choose what to take action on and what is deemed offensive is why the West is having a hard time reconciling when Muslims countries have such poor human rights records towards women, gays and child marriages. What is at the heart of this is that the West is fed up with the exponentially disproportionate amount of extremists terrorizing our entire World from the teachings of one religion. Frankly, the West feels Muslims aren't doing enough. As an outsider, I see that both the Jewish faith and Christian faiths have had a reformation to align their teachings to more progressive ways of thought. However, the Muslim faith has not had such a reformation. I (and I would safely say, a majority of Western individuals) would not post offensive images of Mohammad knowing that he is the sacred god of Muslims. Yet, extremists are targeting the innocent of our society. The Western world is fed up with the 'global' muslim extremism that has been problematic for too long and await Muslims to do more.

Why then would they enjoy reading a man like David Foster Wallace, who was also both earnest and hyper intelligent and studied? First off, I don’t know if they would. But the point is that Wallace came to different conclusions about the state of the universe (which I’m not going into here), abused his mind with way more drugs, tended to write about trivial truths (which he seemed to be aware of, and not always of course), had sex with his students and killed himself (you shall know them by their fruits—the cynics must forgive me the Jesus quote).

religion,Is Hinduism A Religion?,"Truly speaking, when we refer to Hinduism, we do not know whether we should consider it a religion or a group of religions. Neither Hinduism nor any of its sects is founded by a founder or institution. Numerous seers, sages, saints, scholars, philosophers, kings and common people contributed to its multifarious growth. Some of its beliefs and traditions are diametrically opposed to its core teachings which point to its organic growth and inclusive nature. The contradictions of Hinduism lead to the argument that Hinduism cannot be considered a religion in the strict sense of the word, but as a complex theology which was born out of the profound human wisdom of ancient seers and which incorporates into its body numerous beliefs, scriptures, philosophies, concepts and practices.

The word Hindu is not a religious term, but a geographical one. It was originally derived from the River Sindhu (River Indus), which flowed in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. To the world outside, the people who inhabited the region south of the river were known as Hindus. Several centuries later, the land became identified as Hindustan and the faiths of its people, although they were numerous and diverse, became known as Hinduism. Some scholars prefer calling it Santana Dharma, meaning the eternal religion, since God, who is said to be its source, is eternal. The constitution of India recognizes the country as Bharat in memory of the legendary king Bharata or the legendary tribe known as Bharatas to which he belonged.

Hinduism differs from other organized religions in the following aspects:

It is not based upon a particular founder.

It is not based upon a particular religious book.

It is not controlled by a central institution or the authority of any brotherhood such as a church or a sangha or association.

It is flexible and not averse to admit fundamentally diverse thoughts and beliefs into its system.

It accepts other faiths as alternative paths to salvation

It does not believe that dharma can be upheld by forced conversions or through organized missionary activity to proselytize people.

It believes that human beings should be allowed to practice their faith according to their convictions, karmic past and essential nature

It has been evolving continuously, through internal reforms and in response to the threats and challenges posed by rival faiths.",1603777613.0
religion,"The only ""default position"" is solipsism, and what that means for the discussion on theism","Solipsism is the position that only ones own mind exists and is real. It fabricates all other minds, everything outside of oneself. 

Solipsism is the default position precisely because self existence is the one greatest certainty. Further it's not like we actually have or can disprove solipsism, we just find it more likely than not to be false. The world of matter seems consistent and real but even mere knowledge of it relies on one's own mind. Other people seem just as alive and conscious as us, but even mere recognition of this relies on one's own mind. 

Note: I'm in no way a solipsist. I absolutely believe there's an objective world and other minds. Believe, not claim to have absolute truth of. 

This is extremely relevant to theism because theists are often asked for ""proof"" of God, sometimes with added ideas like ""absolute"" or ""concrete"" or ""undeniable"". But we don't have this type of proof for litetally anything. If you need concrete, absolute, undoubtable truth then I'm fine with that, but you should really be a solipist then. More commonly though is the person asking for this type of proof of God already rejects solipsism just as well as the rest of us. In other words concrete proof is needed for gods but not other things people believe in/ accept, a case of special pleading. 

""Okay"" you say, ""but I still have more reason to believe in other minds than gods."" You're probably right! But it opens up a whole new world of possibility. Obviously if you believe nothing ever presented could be reasonably used to be a theist, there's no changing your mind and you're probably proud of it. The issue with that is there have. Take the most basic of them all: the cosmological argument. Atheist or theist if you understand logic you understand the cosmological argument is valid. If it's premises are true then the conclusion is true. The question is if the premises are true.

Now taking this road leads to what atheist William Rowe called epistemological friendliness. Basically this is the idea that people can come to differing but equally reasonable conclusions because epistemology is complicated and very uncertain. For instance if someone never experienced a god, encountered nothing but suffering at the hands of religion, etc then it's perfectly reasonable for them to be an atheist. Likewise if one experiences gods and benefits from their religion, it's perfectly reasonable to be a theist. 

This is just better all around. Besides the obvious fact that kinder engagement will come from seeing those who disagree as still reasonable, this is simply a fact of reality. We don't know much of anything, knowledge is extremely limited.",1603579675.0

This discussion should be done in civillized way, everything I wrote is a personal opinion, if you feel offended and don't want to contribute then please ignore this post.

Also, I urge muslims and jews to correct me if I forget/misunderstand something.


Obviously, each faith will claim its the truth, however for a faith to claim to be an abrahamic faith, it needs at least to lives up to its claims.

- The concept of God: 

God is one. Judaism and Islam agree. No trinity, no one in three or three in one. The Lord Our God Is One. This message was taught by all the prophets/messengers even Jesus/Yesa PBUH. There's no room for discussion, trinity is against monotheism.

And before you quote any verse from the bible.
See this video by this rabbi : 

https://youtu.be/kRVD4NT7RnI

The trinity itself is an assioation with God, a polytheism concept. Trinity puts God's creation (human, spirit) as gods. Next thing we will have people believing satan is god or Mary as god or other continuous blasphemy that will be born from the trinity.

- The concept of Barzakh :

Both jews and muslims believe in it. This concept destroys the foundation of Christianity. There are minor differences in this in Judaism (more like more questions)

Basically when you die you get asked three questions

Who was your God:

The answer is Allahom/Ellohim/Alaha/Eloah/YHWH/Al-Rahim(arabic)/Rakhum(hebrew)...etc or any specific name in your language

Who was your prophet/messenger ?

If you were born in time of Moses PBUH you say Moses PBUH.
If you were born in the time of Noah PBUH you say Noah.
If you were born in the time of David PBUH you say David PBUH.
If you were born in the time of Jesus PBUH you say Jesus PBUH.
If you were born in the time of Mohammed PBUH you say Mohammed PBUH.

(The last two prophets/messengers of God are rejected by the jews according to Judaism)

This is why the messengers of God are the way to God, no one goes to heaven only after he was guided by a messenger/prophet of God in his time.

YOU CAN'T WORSHIP A PROPHET/MESSENGER AS GOD. NEVER EVER. GOD IS ONE.

What was the book you followed ?

Depending on the era you were born, if you were a follower of Moses PBUH you say the Torah, if you were a follower of Jesus PBUH you say the gospel/injeel, muslims will obviously say the Quran.

There are other questions in judaism but this is the most important ones in Islam.


- The concept of original sin :

No, no no no no no no no.

No one shall bear the sins of another. God is justice.

Adam PBUH sinned but then he repented and was forgiven. Judaism and Islam agree. 

The concept of Judgment Day/Yom Al Qiyama destroys the original sin. God will judge every human for his own sins not the sins of Mr. Sakamoto or Miss Rasha next to him. 

Any human is responsible for his own sins. The only way to get rid of sins is through repentence/teshuvah(hebrew?)/toubah(arabic), there are also actions that can help erase sins that are common between judaism and islam. However, forgiveness is only up to God alone.

- Jesus PBUH in Judaism and Islam : 

Jews sees him as heretic jew who led people astray and call them to worship him instead of God.

Muslims sees him as messenger/prophet and the Messiah who performed miracles by God's permission just like Moses parting the red sea or Solomon PBUH talking to animals and he  will come back again in the last days. 
He didn't claim to be a god, he called people to worship God the one and only and FOLLOW HIS COMMANDMENTS , there's no ""new covenant"".

- Religious Laws :

Jews and Muslims live by God's law. Christians are lawless, what are the punishment of murder, theft...etc in Christianity ? Don't bring forgiveness here because God sent messengers and prophets to show us how to live our lives, if he didn't bring laws then humans will commit chaos and the rights of the people will be forgotten.

- Idols, drawings and graven images:

 There's no single church without a naked body  nailed  on a cross or imaginary drawing of Jesus PBUH. 

Idols, drawings and graven images are forbidden in judaism and islam. It doesn't matter your intentions. It's idolatry and it's despised by all the scriptures of God. 

No means No. No idols, no drawings and images.

This is why jews and muslims are forbidden from praying inside a church let alone getting close to it.


- Pagan holidays : 

Easter and all of its eggs, christmas (Jesus PBUH was born in the summer/spring, this was proven biblically and historically )  and even if he was, you should not do this. Only honor the days the God the one and only talked about.

God told us to not imitate the pagans in any way, in clothes (muslims and jews have these specific clothings), holidays...etc. Because if you imitate a pagan you are with him.

Notes : 

I mean the lack of understanding the hebrew and culture of the jews not to mention the clash with pagans have given birth to this disorted christianity. So I understand where the confusion is. However if someone wants to learn about the God of Abraham, the God of humanity he needs to look at the people who were intrusted with the message ( hebrew jews and muslims ) not the trinitarian christians.

- When God told the jews and muslims to pray towards the direction of their holy sites (Jerusalem, Kaaba) as a mean of unity, he didn't command them to worship these places.

- There are certain actions than can help in eradicating sins like sacrificing animals in halal/kosher way for food, giving sadakah/zadakah/charity,  touching the black stones that absorbs sins by GOD'S permission, however forgiveness is up to God alone to decide. These are minor differences between judaism and islam and if any non-jew or non-muslim misunderstand it then he needs better education in semetic languages/cultures/religions.

My side questions for the Jews and Muslims : 

Do you consider christianity an abrahamic faith since christians are pagans according to your revelations ?


Let's begin.


.................................
Edit : Ok, my bad. The christian dominations who don't believe in the trinity, idols....etc deserve to be called an abrahamic faith.

religion,The Kindergarten to Spirituality,"We know that religion is an organized system of beliefs and practices to worship the Creator or the cosmic power, commonly referred to as God. There are many religions in the world. Amongst the known religions, including Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Sikhism, Jainism, Bahai Faith, Zoroastrianism, Shintoism, and Taoism, the largest ones are Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Each religion has its own God and its own scripture. What do religions preach? They teach us how we must pray and they lay down the dos and don’ts of our moral life. Most religions have divine rituals that are devoutly followed by their followers. Every religion forms its own cultural lifestyle and has its own places of pilgrimage. While all religions differ in most aspects, the one thing that they all agree on is the existence of a Creator, God. It is strange but every religion claims that their God is supreme. There is so much devotion, dedication, and passion for their God that most unfortunately, their followers inadvertently start condemning other religions. If one was to introspect, it becomes so obvious that there is only One God. All of creation seems to have one Creator, one God known to different religious followers with different names and different forms. Just because water is called *aqua* in France, *mizu* in Japan, *shui* in China and *paani* in India, it doesn’t change the essence of water.

Why were religions created? It seems that religions were formed when groups of people accepted the theology and philosophy of their saints or sages regarding a belief system to pray to God. Religions are needed to organize faith and prayer and to make our relationship with God more effective. Imagine if a child is born without any religion, how would the child ever know the meaning of God? How would the new entrant into this world comprehend the power that created life and everything on the planet? As kids, whether we are Hindus, Muslims or Christians, religion plays an important role in igniting faith and building our theological foundation of spirituality. While most of the beliefs of a religion may be mythological, the principles behind religions are founded on very sincere objectives of connecting man with God. However, as time passed, man started following religious dogmas, rituals, and superstitions more than the founding principles and teachings of the religion. While this is unfortunate, it is definitely better than a scenario where we are lost without religion and not taught to accept and believe in God. Religion is a kindergarten to spirituality. All religions ignite our faith in God and teach us the basics. It is then for us to evolve, grow and transcend from being religious to being spiritual. Each one of us has an intellect and it is up to us to use this power of discrimination to pick the foundations of our religious beliefs and to knit it into a peaceful and blissful spiritual philosophy for our life.

Religions give their God a name and a form, and often, mythological stories form the foundation of religions. The objective of this is to create an interesting religious tale for youngsters to believe in. What is more important is to understand the existence of God and the realization that the name and the form are meant more to build our faith in the Creator than to be enamored by a picture that symbolizes God. We human beings need form and shape to comprehend something and God, being nameless and formless, would never be understood unless there were religions. It has been a remarkable feat of saints and sages of all the religions of the world to create believers in the vast majority of people. The belief in God as religions project it, unfortunately, has become so strong that we can’t see the true power that lies behind the name and form that we pray to. As kids, we need a religion to initiate our belief in God, but most, unfortunately, we never grow up. We keep our childlike belief until we die.

Why is there a war among the followers of different religions? The power of faith is so strong that the followers become obsessed with their God believing that their religion is supreme and others are inferior. It is common for people of faith to consider their God as the one and only real God and all other Gods to be imposters, duplicates or false representation. This passion behind believing that one’s God is supreme amongst different religious followers and their sincere eagerness to evangelize their religion across the globe has led to conflict and war. Instead of peacefully realizing that God is a power known to different religions differently and understanding that essentially there is one God, people continue their conflict against other religions. If only people realized that their God was no different from the God of other religions, it would foster peace, acceptance, and love in the world. Although we pray to different Gods, we should realize that in essence, God is the power behind all the Gods of all the religions in the world.

God is a power – a power beyond shape, name, and form. It is our inadequacy and incapability of comprehending God that we look up to religious icons as God. There’s actually nothing wrong in doing that. All individuals regardless of all religions, race, caste, creed, or place of birth are manifestations of one Creator, one power, God. God created the earth and everything on it. God also created man, but man is a mortal being. He is born and he dies. God is immortal. Since we cannot see the invisible power and cannot comprehend the power without name, shape, and form, there is no harm in considering a religious icon to be God. However, we must realize the truth beyond. Those who are fortunate to realize the truth pray to God through who they consider a saint rather than to their saint. God is a power beyond human comprehension. We have not been given the sense to perceive God. We understand that God exists. God is the creative power of this cosmos, but we are unable to define who God is, where God is and what God is. To realize God, we need the help of religion just as we need to pass kindergarten to further our education. Religion is just a basic foundation. No religion can give us God, but it can ignite in us a love for God that will eventually make us seek God and realize God.",1605803958.0

The issue of human evil I am not too fussed with, because I accept humans can do whatever they will. But the issue of non-human evil like tsunamis, earthquakes, cancer, deformed people and so on, just seems to be a matter of god being cruel. He has the option to NOT do it, yet does it anyway. 

To religious people, everything is a test. But what is the purpose of testing a 7 year old child with leukaemia? Or killing 200,000+ people in a tsunami in Indonesia? If god was all-loving, he wouldn’t allow others to suffer at his hands. But he does. People in the 2004 Indonesian tsunami saw it as a punishment for their lack of faith, similar to the story of Noah. How can god be this manipulative? The only reason why tsunamis and natural disasters happen often in South East Asia is because of their tectonic plates, not because god is on a mission to punish them. 

My favourite is this quote by David Hume regarding the problem of evil. “Is [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?”

religion,Women and left-wingers converting to Islam...,"I've talked about this subject many times in the past, I've looked at the Quran and Hadith a bit and most importantly, personally talked with many exMuslims during personal meetings and lectures about dangers of Islam (when those were still legal of course) and the conclusion about the topic was always the same, confusion.

The topic I wanted to focus on is 'women and people who are left-wing converting to Islam' because that's something really bizarre for me. I don't do it to defend or make other religions look better, I just want to talk about Islam and confusing logic of some people. 

To make it short and simple, if you ever took interest in Islamic teachings or talked with exMuslims you've probably learned that Islam has some terrible teachings about women (at least by modern western standards), where women are often treated as lesser humans, worth half as much as men, half as intelligent as men, half as trustworthy or faithful as men. Islam allows both mental and physical punishments for disobedient wifes who by the Islamic scripture should completely obey their husbands if they want to go to heaven. Islam also puts heavy restrictions on women, before mentioned strict obedience, body and face covering, telling women where they can't go or what they can't do without man's approval, in extreme cases, Islam even allows death penalty for disobedient/unfaithful women, and much more, often reducing women to a role of breeding slave.

Additionally it probably doesn't come by surprise that Islam is probably the most conservative and traditionalist religion in the world, with some of the most strict rules as well.

(Of course all of this applies only when we talk about real, strict, practicing Muslims, not the ""Modern Muslims"" who don't much care about the detailed everyday Islamic practices and probably have never read through Quran once in their lives, instead just heard about it from their families or Imams or even worse, Islamic Activists on YouTube, who's only purpose is to make Islam look as innocent as possible.)

Thus I find it strange that in recent years it became popular for women and left-wing people to convert to Islam. It just doesn't seem to make sense does it? And yet this bizarre act seems to only trend more.
From what I've noticed while looking at those people on internet, it seems that majority of them must've done it as some twisted show of virtue, since not only almost all of them know very little about Islamic practices, believes, teachings or even the most basic facts about the creation of Islam and Prophet Muhammad's life, but also, many of them openly admits that they don't really practice Islam in their daily life, Islam being probably the most practice and ritual based religion in the world, they just believe and live life identical to the one before converting.
If they don't even put the smallest amount of effort into their new religious lives, why did they even convert? Very often bragging about it as well, whenever and to whoever they can. Why?

What's the point? Virtue signaling? Need of attention? Desire to be rebellious and different? Probably, seems like the only explanation to me.

religion,Did Mohammed's scribes change the Quran?," 

The Islamic faith abundantly claims that the Quran is the pure, unchanged, and uncorruptable word of God. A problem that receives very little attention, however, can be found in Surah Al-Muminun, Ayat 14. This Surah states:

&gt;"" ثُمَّ خَلَقۡنَا ٱلنُّطۡفَةَ عَلَقَةً۬ فَخَلَقۡنَا ٱلۡعَلَقَةَ مُضۡغَةً۬ فَخَلَقۡنَا ٱلۡمُضۡغَةَ عِظَـٰمً۬ا فَكَسَوۡنَا ٱلۡعِظَـٰمَ لَحۡمً۬ا ثُمَّ أَنشَأۡنَـٰهُ خَلۡقًا ءَاخَرَ‌ۚ فَتَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ أَحۡسَنُ ٱلۡخَـٰلِقِينَ ""

**TRANSLATION:**

&gt;""then We developed the drop into a clinging clot ˹of blood˺, then developed the clot into a lump ˹of flesh˺, then developed the lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, then We brought it into being as a new creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.""

Besides the complete lack of scientific accuracy displayed in the verse, there is actually a deeper problem than what we see on the surface. But first, it is important to recall some background information-- Mohammed was illiterate, and was not able to directly write down the words that God revealed to him. Instead, he had scribes who would listen to his recitation of the sacred verses, and copy them down into their own compendiums.

One of Mohammed's scribes was [Abdallah ibn Saʿd ibn Abi Sarḥ](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abd-Allah-ibn-Sad-ibn-Abi-Sarh). Abdallah was a smart guy who was good at writing, and Mohammed saw it fitting to make him his scribe.

[Abdallah would often suggest changing the closing words of some verses in the Quran](https://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/meccan10.htm), with Mohammed's permission. For example, when Mohammed would say ""And God is mighty and wise"", Abdallah would respond ""And God is knowing and wise"" and Mohammed would answer that there is no objection. Abdallah was slightly suspicious at the fact that he swayed Mohammed, a supposed true prophet, into changing words that were allegedly given by God. Abdallah was beginning to consider renouncing Islam.

**But that's not all!**

What really sealed the deal in Abdallah's apostasy was even more dramatic. In the Surah provided earlier, the sentence ""So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators."" is [actually the words of Abdallah himself, after hearing Mohammed recite the first sentence of the verse.](https://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=86&amp;tSoraNo=6&amp;tAyahNo=93&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=2) Mohammed replied with “This \['Abd Allah's last expression\] is how it was revealed to me” , and Abdallah's words were put into the Quranic text.

When Abdallah noticed that Mohammed gave the green light to change and add words into the Quran, Abdallah renounced Islam and fled to Mecca. After Mohammed eventually took power of Mecca, he issued an order to kill Abdallah, but Abdallah pled for amnesty and it was granted to him. Abdallah actually re-converts to Islam in the future, likely in order to obtain his new political position as the governor of Egypt.

From what I have seen, the general Islamic response to this is ""the source of this story is inauthentic"", but then again, why do you get to determine what is authentic or not?

Please feel free to discuss these findings. I don't intend to offend anyone through this argument, this is simply an observation. I am completely open to new ideas and I am simply trying to seek the truth. If possible, I would really like to get the Islamic perspective on this argument.",1604212785.0
religion,"People say they believe in a Prophet partly due to the suffering they endured, and then reject other Prophets...","But all the Prophets, throughout history, have suffered at the hands of unbelievers. Moses was banished, Christ was crucified, Mohammad was assailed from every side for bringing the Guidance from God to the people, The Bab was martyred by a squad of 750 soldiers for speaking the Word of God, Baha'u'llah describes in His own words the persecution: 
  ""Alas, alas, for that which befell Him Who was the Manifestation of the Self of God, and for that which He and His loved ones were made to suffer! The people inflicted upon them what no soul hath ever inflicted upon another, and what no infidel hath wrought against a believer or suffered at his hand. Alas, alas! That immortal Being sat upon the darksome dust, the Holy Spirit lamented in the retreats of glory, the pillars of the Throne crumbled in the exalted dominion, the joy of the world was changed into sorrow in the crimson land, and the voice of the Nightingale was silenced in the golden realm. Woe betide them for what their hands have wrought and for what they have committed!
Hearken then unto that which the Bird of Heaven uttered, in the sweetest and most wondrous accents, and in the most perfect and exalted melodies, concerning them – an utterance that shall fill them with remorse from now unto ""the day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds"":  ""Although they had before prayed for victory over those who believed not, yet when there came unto them He of Whom they had knowledge, they disbelieved in Him. The curse of God on the infidels!"" [Qur'án 83:6; 2:89]  Such indeed are their condition and attainments in their vain and empty life. Erelong shall they be cast into the fire of affliction and find none to help or succour them.""

religion,Limitations On Propagation,"Propagating the faith is not one of the obligatory duties in Hinduism. Since people are subject to karma and bound to the cycle of births and deaths, they have to earn the right to acquire the right knowledge through self-effort only, and they have to come to it by earning the merit through righteous actions. The scripture suggest that God loves those who propagate his teachings to people who are ready for that knowledge. At the same time, they also state that one should not confuse others with their knowledge. Since people are deluded and ignorant, they should be allowed to practice their chosen Dharma, however inferior it might be.

The world is made up of dualities. They serve as the framework of our knowledge. Hence, whether it is religion, science or any other branch of knowledge, contradictions and diversity of opinion are inevitable in our world. Since our knowledge is relative to the context and the perspective in which they are perceived or comprehended, we cannot consider any truth absolute, except those which are declared so in the revelatory scriptures such as the eternal and indivisible state of Brahman or the nature of Self.

Relative truths and polarities of opinion exist in our perceptual world because God in his eternal wisdom has granted free will and freedom to each human being to explore and comprehend truth according to his or her essential nature. That freedom should not be taken away by any human institution or individual because in the ultimate analysis everything here is subject to the eternal and inviolable law of Dharma and Nature. They ensure that our knowledge is defined and limited by the degree of our delusion and ignorance as well as by the degree of purity or impurity which is present in us.

Diversity is the outward projection of God. Its purpose is to confuse, delude, distract and attract so that one remains engaged with it. All our intellectual knowledge is part of it. Hence some confusion is inevitable in our understanding any subject. The more we explore truth with our minds and senses the more we become confused. Hence, Hinduism cautions people against becoming excessively involved with the world, and recommends for withdrawing into oneself to find the eternal truth which is hidden in all. When you find it, knowledge becomes self-evident, and confusion and delusion disappear.

The diversity and complexity of Hinduism also teaches us an important lesson. It is the need for humility and openness in our thinking and attitude so that we can avoid debating and disputing with others on trivial matters and cultivate the all inclusive vision of the inner Self, without which one cannot purify the mind and stabilize it in contemplation.",1606022984.0
religion,The Significance Of The Vedas,"The Vedas are companions of the learned, the knowledgeable and the wise. They serve the humanity in upholding Dharma and helping them achieve liberation. When recited, they purify the mind and body and increase the quality of Sattva. Having the knowledge of the Vedas makes a person noble and austere. Studying them is a good karma. When they are loudly chanted, the sounds also purify the atmosphere and make the place holy. The symbolism of the Vedas is represented in Shri Dattatreya, who is considered a manifestation of Lord Vishnu. He is shown to be always followed by four dogs who remain at his feet all the time. These four dogs represent the four Vedas, signifying that the Vedas would always remain in the service of God, like faithful dogs and serve his cause.",1605418386.0
religion,Thoughts on religion,"I am agnostic. A spiritual person without ties to religion. Just another two legged mammal reliant on photosynthesis.

Religion has been used as a tool of oppression for centuries. It is used to justify war and hate. It creates division throughout humanity.

When our species lived in small groups or tribes, these rituals and beliefs came into being. Many religions developed and adapted over time to try to provide answers for the unknown, as well as rules for living within the community. As these groups expanded, their religions grew. Religions were, and largely still are, a regional aspect of human life. 

As humanity has grown, there have been many wars. Some fought for religious reasons, many under its guise. Through these wars, religions consolidated into the dominant creeds of today. Many religions splintered off to accommodate prophets and kings. Some were forced to adjust and include aspects of the non dominant religions as they attempted to be more civil in their treatment of the defeated. 

Many religions have concepts and ideas that intertwine, and all major religions are a fruit of the same tree. There are things one can learn, both positive and negative from any religion. 

Good and bad are abstract ideas given value by a rule set, often put forth in religious texts. These texts were written thousands of years ago and translated many times. Not only does this allow for misinterpretation, but has not adapted to keep up with humanity.

Today, what is of best value to our species is compassion. While many religions teach this in some form, no religion does it best. 

The rest is theory - untestable, unprovable theories. Any of which could be as wrong or right as the other, none of which have real impact on our lives outside of setting parameters for behavior. Karma and rebirth, heaven and hell, and other afterlife beliefs are all a rudimentary consequence for behavior. The carrot and the stick. Why must there be a reason to be companionate, is it not intrinsically rewarding? 

Being positive brings out the positivity in others, as it also goes for the opposite. More importantly, thinking positively increases our ability to have positive actions. We have some control over both our thoughts and our actions, and because of this we have some sway with the people we interact with. Hence, “be the change you want to see.” It is not up to God, or written in the stars.

Religion is useful for many people, mainly as a construct of community. It can also relieve a fear of the unknown, but the unknown can be a fountain of creativity and innovation. The difficulties facing humanity tomorrow cannot be solved with the tools of yesterday. We must continue to evolve.

Mother Earth is suffering. Our species has one home, and we are neglecting to care for it. Our planet is a living thing who gives birth to and sustains all known life with the help of the Sun. Over the years, our planet has evolved to form a balanced cyclical ecosystem.

There is a finite amount of carbon, oxygen, and other elements. The plants we and other animals eat are made up of elements used by our bodies to build and maintain itself, and when we die, new plants use our particles to sustain themselves. The cycle of energy is similar. The sun’s energy flows through every part of life, used and transferred from one form to the next. It is important that we respect this energy cycle, because if we do not the cycle can collapse. 

When we disrespect billions of years of Mother Earth’s evolutionary wisdom, we threaten the balance of our entire planet. We need to learn to work in harmony with our ecosystem, not against it. Studying natural order is the best way to do this. When we learn to imitate nature, we can restore natural spaces and one day live a healthier, balanced life as a species. So often the simplest, most efficient way of doing something is the way Mother Nature has already evolved to accomplish the task.",1605247628.0

religion,Interaction With Other Religions,"Since Hinduism never existed as a monolithic religion, but lived in parts and in numerous guises, the competing religions which either originated in India or entered India from outside during its long history could not make much difference to it. They influenced it in parts, while they were influenced in turn, thus resulting in a synthetic ethnic culture which currently distinguishes the Indian subcontinent from the rest of the world.

The interaction also resulted in numerous reforms and improvements within Hinduism. For example, Hindu caste system grew from a fourfold social order into a complex system, consisting of numerous castes and sub castes. Second, it shifted the attention of its followers from external ritual practices to internal spiritual practices. Third, it facilitated the integration of numerous sects and schools of philosophy.

We can see traces of early reforms within Hinduism in the epic Mahabharata, several Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita. We may reckon Lord Krishna as one of the earliest social and religious reformers of his times. The Buddha was not the first social or religious reformer of ancient India. Before him there were many, and among them Lord Krishna was one of the most prominent. To a careful reader of the Bhagavad-Gita it becomes self-evident that the scripture was a reaction against religious conditions of his times.

It synthesized many divergent ideas of the epic period and created a coherent philosophy and spiritual approach to the problem of bondage and karma, offering ideal solutions to live god-centric or soul-centric life. In the teachings of Lord Krishna you will find a rational basis for pious people to resolve the contradictions that are inherent in various paths of liberations such as the paths of action (karma), of knowledge (jnana), of intelligence (buddhi), of renunciation (sanyasa), of contemplation (atma samyama), and of devotion (bhakti) and integrate them into a coherent system which is ideally suitable for householders. The scripture offers them a convincing approach to pursue the four chief aims of human life namely dharma, artha (wealth), kama (sexual desire) and moksha (liberation), without compromising their ultimate goal, which is liberation.

The divergent Darshana philosophies of Hinduism, and the emergence of atheistic and materialistic traditions such as the Charvakas and Lokayatas, apart from the rise of renunciant traditions such as Buddhism Jainism, the Sramanas, Parivrajakas, Ajivikas and Nirgaranthas, all of them were also products of a similar development. They emerged from the exploratory and inquisitive minds of numerous scholars, thinkers and enlightened masters. Although they opposed the Hindu traditions such as Vedism, Shaivism and Vaishnavism and competed with them for followers, in the end they either yielded to their influence or became dissolved in them.

The Upanishads, which emerged as the end-parts of the Vedas, were also products of scholarly reaction against the tyranny of the Vedic ritualism sanctioned by the Samhitas and Brahmanas. The same was the case with the Bhakti movement, which originally started in the South in the first or the second century A.D., and culminated in the subsequent rise and popularity of Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The rise of Tantrism and other movements, at a time when Buddhism and Jainism were on the ascendance and gaining ground, added further complexity to the prevailing traditions of Hinduism and provided it with the much-needed depth and diversity for which it is known today. The schools of monism or nondualism (Advaita), dualism (Dvaita) and qualified nondualism (Vishistadvaita), they were the internal reactions within its fold, which attracted the attention of many seekers of truth and encouraged them to explore the true nature of their existence, the world and reality.

It is said that the competition among divergent sampradayas (religious traditions) was very intense in ancient times, which often resulted in religious intolerance. It showed up as animosity, disputes and wars between warring kingdoms and rival factions, while scholars from rival traditions vented their feelings through debates and discussions and creative slander. However, through that commotion and confrontation the various traditions of Hinduism emerged unscathed, gaining knowledge and inspiration from numerous sources, which imparted to it richness and diversity. It is still the most dominant tradition of India, which wields considerable influence over a large section of Indians.",1604380478.0
religion,The Transformative Nature Of Hinduism,"Throughout its history, Hinduism has never been stagnant. It has been continuously and incrementally evolving from stage to stage, adapting and transforming itself to the changing, social and political dynamics of India and the world. While circumstances played a considerable role in its growth and transformation, it also benefited greatly over the ages from the contribution of numerous seers, sages, saints, kings, scholars, devotees, and patrons. By correcting, influencing, modifying, and integrating various aspects of the tradition according to the needs and demands of the times, they kept the lamp of Hindu wisdom and spirituality bright and burning. With foresight and wisdom, they provided knowledge and guidance to a multitude of people, while the world was still overshadowed by endless wars, violence, barbarism, savagery.

The seers, sages and enlightened teachers of Hinduism enriched the tradition, gave it depth and complexity, and imparted to it great flexibility and openness for which it is well known today, making it appealing and acceptable to a wide range of people with different temperaments, beliefs and attitudes. Because of them, Hinduism has become like an ocean, allowing into it the flow of diverse streams of thought from all directions. Just as an ocean, it remained firm and stable, in a world of impermanence and change, absorbing new knowledge and traditions, without losing in the process its moorings and original character. Despite its long history and numerous influences, it did not compromise its basic ideals, nor lost its vitality and core beliefs. Instead, it grew in strength and character, radiating its wisdoms to illuminate and enlighten eager minds, and absorbing new thoughts and concepts, without discarding what it has already gathered. Over the centuries, it peacefully and harmoniously integrated the old with the new and broadened its base.",1604290357.0
religion,Is Christianity Going to Seed?,"The New Testament is awash in late 2nd Temple Jewish apocalypticism. This religious worldview is the source and underlying essence of Christianity, although generally it is hidden from them by their churches. 

In the apocalyptic worldview of the NT:

1. Jesus Christ brought the natural world to an end, and is bringing in the Messianic Kingdom.
2. The natural world, in the eschatological view, is characterized by the fact that angels and demons exercise power in it.
3. According to Jewish apocalypticism, the evil of the world comes from the demons, who have established themselves between God and mankind.
4. Jesus came to overthrow the power of the prince of demons, whom he calls ""the evil one."" (Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one"" (Matthew 6:13).
5. The death and resurrection of Jesus was supposed to usher in the Kingdom. But it didn't work out that way. NT texts like 2 Thessalonians and Revelation make it clear that a great deal of tribulation and domination by the powers of wickedness is still coming our way. Darn it!

The world still has plenty of evil and suffering. Christians, who more and more are rejecting their polite and rationalistic traditions, are turning to the scriptures again, which tell them that the creation lies under the power of Satan, ""the god of this world."" 

The more fucked up the world continues to be, as it surely will after this Tuesday, the more Christians will believe in ""spiritual warfare,"" ""wickedness in high places,"" the rule of demons over their souls and the fate of the world.

Truly, the humane and good side of Christianity (whatever that is exactly) will go into eclipse. Christians will become more and more like the Enochic and Essene and DSS Jews of the Hellenistic age, going to seed with their miserable scriptures about the rule of demons over a helpless humanity.",1604168898.0

Inhabitants of a dimension or planet different from the one we inhabit (Olympus, Asgard, Heaven, etc.), who may or may not influence or visit ours via powers that we humans as of yet lack. 

Comic books handle this fairly well: 

* Marvel's Asgard is a place inhabited by humanoid aliens with super strength and longevity, accessible via a magic that functions in a way basically indistinguishable from a technology. 
* DC's version of the Greek gods left Mt. Olympus long ago, but are still able to come to earth to whoop Superman when he steps out of line, though he's actually able to stand toe to toe with them. 
* Doctors Doom and Strange travel to Hell (without dying, of course) to free Doom's mother from the clutches of Mephisto (Mephistopheles). 

I'm not saying that belief in any particular god is akin to belief in any of these stories as fact, but I am saying that if any of them is revealed to be true, then how they're depicted in comics is the most realistic depiction we have. They would be *aliens* with *superpowers*. And that applies no matter which it is/are.

That murderer would go into hell and be tortured for all of time for letting a woman go into eternal bliss for all of time faster. Where's the logic in that? 


The garden of eden was discribed as a wonderful garden of peace and love and what not. Then one day a snake whispered bad things into Eve's ear making her want to eat the apple. Eve shared it with Adam who ate the apple and boom first sin ever. God threw adam and eve out of the garden which was basically heaven on earth for doing something that they wouldn't have done anyway if it weren't for that serpent. If god is all knowing why didn't he punish the serpent? 


The rebellion against god is just dumb. God who is all knowing should have known that a rebellion was about to happen in say 19 years for lack of better number. Why didn't he just go to lucifer and talk to him about it? Really build that father son relationship ya know?

We find this comments, mainly by christians insulting the term ""Allah"" with degrading names. They do not think that they are comitting blasphemy. The problem is this people do not even speak semitic languages.

I never met a jew/hebrew who insulted Allah.

I never met semitic christians who insulted Allah.

I met non semitic people who  insulted Allah.

religion,"According to the Tower of Babel story, wouldn't making an international auxiliary language be heretical?","Just to avoid confusion, I'm only familiar with the Christian version of the story.

As for those who may/probably have no clue what an International Auxiliary Language (commonly abbreviated as IAL) is, simply, its a constructed language intended to be easy to learn. They're meant to be learnt to allow communication between different cultures without having to learn a (theoretically) harder natural language.

It used to be a tradition in the conlanging community (conlang is short for constructed language) to show off one's conlang by translating the tower of babel story. This isn't so common now, since many people complained about the obvious religious bias in translating a story from the Bible. Besides that, the text isn't the most complicated grammatically, so some argued it wasn't really that great of a way to show off a highly developed conlang anyway. 

Of course, if you actually read the story, it seems to imply that God wanted people to be divided by language, to place a limit on what they could do. So wouldn't trying to create an IAL be going against God's will? 

This is something I've thought about for a while, but never really had a place to discuss it. Of course, not all religions may take issue with this, I'm just saying that Christianity probably should. Though to be honest, I've noticed that Christians tend to accept quite a lot of things that the Bible condemns. Given that some fundamentalist groups tend to spend a lot of time denouncing certain things they see as going against the Bible, its surprising the number of things that never seem to come up, including this very topic. 

Surely, there must be some Christian out there that's opposed to IALs. I mean, long long ago, I heard of a black non-fiction writer who claimed that when he was young, he wrote a horror story, and everyone gave him flak about it purely because he used the word 'hell' in the title. Most notably, his grandmother accused him of 'lying', because the story was fictitious. Seriously. If a Christian would seriously claim that writing fiction is sinful, surely someone must have attacked the IAL movement at some point in time.

What do you think of this? Has there been any sort of fundamentalist preacher who spoke out against the IAL movement? Then again, its pretty obscure, and obviously hasn't met with much success, so maybe its just not top priority for most fundamentalists. If an IAL actually got somewhere, or more people at least knew about it, maybe this would be more common.",1605434897.0

religion,My Views On Christianity vs. Islam,"Recently, I've been studying the religions of Christianity and Islam, and could easily come to a conclusion of one or the other. However, both of these religions have proofs that combat the other, and so I find myself in a loops of contradictions. 

For instance, in Christianity, there are many (500+) witnesses who have testified that they saw Jesus Christ rise from the dead after the crucifixion. This is quite compelling evidence since a few of these witnesses have died for trying to spread the word of what they saw. This, to me, is not something that seems merely coincidental.

However, in Islam, they believe that Jesus Christ did NOT get crucified, thereby not being able to rise from the dead. This is backed up by a biblical verse that states the following;

*For it is written: ‘He will command His angels concerning You to guard You carefully; and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’ But Jesus answered, “It also says, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’* 

Jesus agrees to this statement of him not being able to get hurt. So would this not contradict the idea of him being crucified? 

But in the Quran, there are many instances of scientific truths that were not yet discovered until many, many years later (\~1400). This includes the big bang theory, the expansion of the universe, embryology, and the fact that every living being is made of primarily water.

Both religions have conflicting evidences within its' own religion, and with its' counterpart religion. So, is anyone able to help me understand these proofs and come to a conclusion of the one true religion?",1604792993.0
religion,Folk Traditions of Hinduism,"Since the earliest times, India has been home to diverse groups of people. Historically, people from various parts of the world migrated to India in search of good life, riches, farmlands or green pastures. It is now widely accepted that the Indus Valley people were also heterogeneous and belonged to diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. The diversity of Indian population remained intact throughout its long history. Vedic community itself was not much different from the rest of India. Apart from urban settlements and organized village communities, there were many tribes and rural folk who lived in different parts of the subcontinent, practicing various faiths and occupations and speaking numerous languages. Most of them lived on the fringes of Vedic society and the civilized world, but enjoyed considerable freedom in practicing their faith. They had no access to the Vedic scriptures or the right to worship Vedic gods. Instead, they worshipped Nature, plants, trees, mountains, rivers, ancestors, spirits, snakes, lakes, oceans, village deities, family deities, and so on. At times, they also practiced animal and human sacrifices. Overtimes, many of their practices became integrated into Hinduism as is evident from the fact that in many parts of India people still worship village and local deities, celebrate festivals in their honor and make offerings to ancient and ancestral spirits, and some very primitive deities.

Thus, we can see that what we understand today as Hinduism originally started thousands of years ago as numerous independent streams. Over the course of time, it absorbed numerous traditions, beliefs and practices, acquiring in the process a great complexity, depth and character, whereby today it caters to the religious and spiritual needs of a wide range of people from the highly educated and enlightened to the ignorant and the uninformed. It is very much like the River Ganges which begins in the Himalayas as a small streamlet and ends up in the Bay of Bengal as a mighty river.",1604550262.0

religion,The universal religion,"1. At the beginning there was one
2. That being was god, our united consciousness
3. God, created the world, in order to experience himself/herself
4. God's consciousness is received in the cerebral cortex of living beings. The more developed this area, the higher level of intelligence and also consciousness. 
5. Therefore god's spirit exists within all humans. But also animals with developed brains such as dolphins, elephants, and dogs/cats can receive gods spirit.
6. However humans also possess an ego. This ego, is created by the more primal instincts and urges within us. It is created by our natural drive to survive, reproduce, and our natural reward/avoidance limbic system. 
7. Our ego can easily dominate the spirit within us. The ego is our identity. It persists by thinking, of either the past and what we have done or the future and what may happen. The ego prevents us from being present in the now, where our spirit thrives.
8. This is why although godliness can exists in us, the ego can take over and cause humans to do evil.
9. There is no such thing as magic. The splitting of the sea by Moses was due to impeccable timing of receding waters of the red sea. God works through timing, however some people also possess gifts. Such as being naturally charismatic, smart, or able to see visions through dreams (prophets, although they're probably a lot of fake ones)
10. Unfortunately god is also bound by the rules and physics of the natural world. He/she can put into play a certain string of events to lead to a desired outcome. such as a friend inviting you for a trip, and you going prevents you from getting hurt from an earthquake that hit your home. But God cannot prevent the impending  natural disaster from occuring itself.
11. Science is real, science explains how god made the world. It is important to remember that many religious texts were written by those without a current understanding of science. And is also filled with symbolism that is not meant to be taken literally. Instead it has to be interpreted. For example, in the bible it says that god took a rib from man and made women. What it is actually referring to is X and Y chromosomes. To someone in the ancient times who saw a vision of this the chromosomes may have resembled ribs. If you look at the difference between Y (male) and X (female), the only difference is a segment is gone from Y (a rib!)
12. Life is a cycle, there isnt an actual heaven or hell. However, you can make life feel like heaven/hell depending on your circumstances.
13. What actual happens when you die, is that your ego, which is a product of the brain, dies.  however your spirit (your consciousness) keeps living. The brain is a receiver of consciousness, similarly to a cellphone antenna for LTE. It processes the signal but it is not the origin.
14. Eventually as our consciousness leaves the physical world, when humanity eventually ends, there is nothing left to observe the world. In quantum mechanics in order for something to be real it has to be observed. Aka schrodinger's cat. With the world no longer being observed byp conscious beings within the world it is as if it doesn't exist.
15. Time and space, both of which are relative, are defined by us. Aka how long is a minute or a meter. The intersectional between time and space, is gravity. Since there are no longer any being bound in the physical world to observe what point in space time it is at, god (us) can control it at will. God can reset the frame of reference, to the beginning of time simply by observing it as so. Then begin the cycle of the universe again.

 So what is the purpose of this? Well so we can have eternal life, so we can always experience. So that at the end of the movie, life, it is isn't just a empty black screen for eternity. We made it, we made it pretty darn good. That's how amazing we are, god is us, and since god is us of course we would make a system where we can endlessly experience things. One of my favorite quotes from Jesus is this 

‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.’  This is the first and greatest commandment.  A second is equally important: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’

Basically, love yourself, because God is within you. And love your neighbors, because God is within them too. All major religions, have truths within them. All rivers eventually lead to the ocean. However they were ultimately written by man, and influenced by the society at the time. There's also a lot of symbolism. My aim is not to disprove them, but interpret the true messages within them.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure plenty of my fellow theists are comforted by their religion and treat it kind of like a blanket. Most never leave their birth religion. But this idea that comfort is like the why of religion seems ridiculous to me. Mainly because I would find nihilistic materialism waaaaaaaay more comforting. As a Satanist I'm pretty unsympathetic to Christianity, but even i can't imagine the worry of hell and constant need to be aware of sin is *comfortable*. Shit the people who use this argument would probably turn around and say fear mongering is what drives religion! Can't have it both ways either. 

Saying ""eh, they just do it for comfort"" seems to be a cozy and easy way to, well, not worry about the question. To put the mind at ease about it. Hell not only do you not have to worry if it's true, you can avoid the discussion all together! You don't even have to criticize religion as your fellow atheist does, ""let them be comfortable!""

A lesson? A lesson that desiring to make friends and have company can be dangerous? That someone thought that life would be grand if there were risks involved when trying to accomplish even the most basic and genuine of things?

Earliest christian and jewish scriptures are greek and hebrew. And the concept of the Trinity came in the 4th century of the council of naesea.

religion,Hinduism Is A Way Of Life,"Those who are familiar with Hinduism know that is not a religion, but a way of life. It is very true. Hinduism is not supposed to be practiced on specific occasions or at specific places. You may go to temples and offer worship to gods. You may perform daily rituals. In Hinduism they do not constitute true practice. Hinduism has to be lived in word and deed from the time you wake up and until you go to bed. Your commitment to the Dharma extends even beyond this world into the next world since your karma follows you like your shadow.

For Hindus life is a continuous sacrifice, which begins with the sacrifice of semen during conception and ends with the sacrifice of the body during cremation. The intermittent period is marked by a series of other sacrifices. Every action is a sacrifice. Eating, sleeping, drinking, rejoicing, worshipping, marriage, sexual union, rearing children, supporting parents, offering food to gods, humans, etc., all these are sacrifices only which lead to sin if they are done with selfish intent and liberation if they are offered to God.

According to the tenets of Hinduism, life and religion are inseparable. Religion pervades your whole life, just as the omnipresent Brahman, dominating and regulating every aspect of your life, and aligning it with the aims of creation and the functions of God. As an aspect of God, you have an obligation to manifest the will of God upon earth and play your dutiful role in ensuring the order and regularity of the world. Thus, in living your life upon earth as a personification of God, you are never separate from your source and from your ordained duties.

Dharma, which is a set of your prescribed duties, controls every action of a devout Hindu. Though he has the freedom to live his life according to his desires and expectations, he cannot yield to them because it will bind him to the cycle of births and deaths. Therefore, if he wants to be free from suffering and escape from rebirth, he has to put God at the center of his life and live it for his sake rather than for himself. Thus, the invisible hands of religion predominate the thinking of a devout Hindu at every step, and make him a part of the larger vision of God. Beneath his mind, his religion remains, like an undercurrent, influencing his thinking and actions.",1604122788.0

The Vedas are called Nigamas, in contrast to agamas of Shaivism. They are believed to be composed neither by man nor by gods but were revealed to Vedic seers in meditative states. Hence, they are called ""shrutis"" (the heard ones), in contrast to ""smritis"" (the memorial texts). The Vedic Aryans regarded the Vedas as timeless (sanatana), revealed by Brahman, the Supreme Being, through Brahma, the creator god, for the welfare of the world. They are considered eternal and indestructible aspects of Brahman which will remain with us for the duration of the creation cycle and will be withdrawn like everything else at the time of the dissolution of the worlds and beings. They form the basis of Vedic religion out of which Hinduism of today evolved through gradual phases. The Vedas are considered the personification of Brahman in literary form.

religion,Hinduism encounter with Islam and Christianity,"Interaction with other religions, coupled with internal reforms and assimilation of numerous sects and traditions, and absence of a distinct identity, monolithic character and centralized institutions prepared the native traditions Hinduism to face off successfully with Islam and Christianity when they entered the subcontinent through foreign subjugation. When they confronted the native faiths, these two Abrahamic religions had immense political clout and vast resources at their disposal to exert themselves. However, they succeeded but little, largely because what they confronted was very much unlike them in its composition, temperament, philosophical diversity, organization and essential character.

It was a time when Hinduism, was not yet a fully recognized as a unified religion. It existed but as an idea or in name. What they confronted was a large body of distinct faiths, beliefs and practices which were practiced by the native people who belonged to diverse ethnic, social, political, linguistic and regional groups. Their faith was strong, since it imparted to them a certain identify and nativity against the oppressors. It also gave them a feeling of continuity since the same belief systems were followed by their ancestors for generations.

Thus, their faith defined them and distinguished them and imparted to them self-identity and self-respect. Their entrenched beliefs, respect and devotion to their gods, elders and ancestors, their very ethnicity which inculcated in them a sense of unity and belongingness, and the promise of life, righteousness and liberation which the faiths offered them proved to be a major obstacle for the invaders to enforce their faith upon them, despite the absence of centralized religious authority or a strong political patronage.

Therefore, they succeeded but little in converting native people. With the help of money, power and political coercion, they managed to convert a few vulnerable groups, but overall their methods were ineffective. They did shake Hinduism and left it a little bruised and battered in parts, but they were mostly unsuccessful in their attempts to change the mindset and the loyalty of the native people towards their ancestral faiths.",1604463435.0

Since this picture stretches through 13 billion years of space and time, most, or at least a lot, of the stars are already dead; only to be remembered by the light that is still traveling to us. That’s more than most humans will ever get. The majority of people who’ve ever lived, as me and you probably will be, have been completely and totally forgotten, and will never be remembered by anyone. Their names and faces lost to the sea of time. Religion is just a false cure for our need to be important; our need to be remembered.

The same thing happens to humans after they die as happens to ants when they are squished, to deer when they are shot, and to our shrew ancestors when they were eaten by larger predators: absolutely nothing. The afterlife may have been a necessary comfort for people living thousands of years ago, when life was abjectly horrible almost all the time, and it may have even seemed reasonable to the uneducated and ignorant masses of unwashed primitives; but now we know too much about so much more than they could have ever imagined that points away from life after death and towards an infinite void of nonexistence. It’s so silly to think that a big-brained species of ape would ever get to be immortal. And who wants to live in heaven for eternity anyway? “Year 10 trillion something - Dear diary, did the same thing today as I did for the last billion years: praise god.

religion,[Philosophy] The O.O.O God,"Hi everyone. I'm an atheist, but I'm really open minded about religion. I'm very interested in philosophical arguments, which are attempting to prove or disprove God's existence.

I would like to hear what religious people think about this question: assuming that the Abrahamic God, ie the unique supreme creator of the universe, exists. No matter from which religion, let's just focus only on the concept of God and its divine attributes. The Abrahamic religions generally tend to depict God as an omnipotent (He can do whatever he wants to do), omniscient (He knows everything, past-present-future), and omnibenevolent (He is morally perfect and wants humans to be happy) being.
The O. O. O God.

My question is: would it be logically possible that a God which is neither omnipotent, omniscient, nor omnibenevolent, could exist ? If not, why ?
If it is possible according to you, would it be more probable that God is O. O. O, or not O. O. O ? (a NO.NO.NO God 🎅) 

That's it, I'm looking forward to read your arguments, and to discuss it. Thanks, peace !",1604086151.0

EGAT THEORY - Evil God Alien Theory by EGAT User 55

Warnings :

1. Some of this material you read may cause you to re-question your existence in reality, and may even cause you to be shocked/dazed/confused for hours or more.
2. May cause difficulty in sleeping or focus. 
3. This is not intended to offend your view of god. This is my speculated theory, not based off any religion 
4. This view of reality may permanently alter your current view of reality and cause you to question everything differently
5. May diminish your hierarchal positioning of god, although knowing/realizing this information would theoretically act as a cheat considering you know the truth
6. This theory may excite you so much that it increases your dopamine levels to where you would even be satisfied with living on the streets homeless with nothing. But just satisfied you have overcome or found God.

Grand Theory Summarized:

1. The Evil God Alien that ultimately created us, created us strictly for his/her/it own entertainment purposes

***** Main Part To Read: *****

General Points to be noted to understand the proposed Grand Theory better :

1. God can be perceived in tiered levels (tier 1 god is the formless God, he created/manifested a formed being God which is known as the tier 2 God)
2. We are birthed by the Tier 2 God which is a formed being not the formless Tier 1 God *(View Reference Problem #1 which discusses the question of whether Tier 1 God and Tier 2 God are the same mind consciousness)*
3. Theoretically and realistically speaking , we(human bodies) are flawed in the sense we can break apart and never truly recover (lost arm can handicap a person for the rest of their lives). Which puts the wide accepted belief that “God is perfect” into question considering why would he create imperfect creatures that can break apart ? (This adds more leverage/momentum to the proposed fact that we weren’t created by the formless tier 1 god but instead by a formed tier 2 god)
4. Additionally there’s wide speculation and sayings that we are created in God’s image, and why wouldn’t a god want to create a child or being in its own image? Well clearly our creator was a formed human being that himself may have been created by a formless being (This puts this point into now open observation, meaning we were created not in a perfect image(meaning the best mathematical form we could’ve been given in life, which would include extreme flexibility{no breaking of bones/no limitations}, maybe the option to not have to feed ourselves every day just to maintain our health(digital robot like features since our opposition theory supposed god is perfect and all knowing), maybe the option to not feel pain(which adds into one of the Main Theories that all these sub points are building knowledge towards, which is we were created for viewing entertainment purposes by an evil alien god(since boredom is normal, especially if your a god and never die{literally meaning you are alive and your eyes or whatever a god would view with are open for thousands of years , millions of years, or even trillions of years. Just imagine a god that has to view stuff and be alive for let’s say a confined time of 1 trillion years so we can speculate on it. It would be foolish to think such a species(and I’m saying this because I do believe these Tier 2 Gods are a “species” meaning there’s more than 1, and they roam around just like humans but probably not on planets , probably through space and time) {also I’m constantly adding notes in brackets so you understand the references opposed to saying read reference 12.5, since most people don’t, and thankfully for you I summarize the information in the brackets as much as possible). So I mentioned the proposed fact that these Tier 2 gods are a species because it can conclude that maybe humans are just one of many forms of intelligent beings? Since people do claim there’s other forms of intelligence beings out there since there’s millions of universes. And bam there you have the solution to who created the other formed intelligent being, it was the Tier 2 Formed God species. (It can also be debated whether there’s only one Tier 1 God or there’s an entire species. Since it’s a never ending question that who created who first.) So this is a long point and we were just talking about how Humans gained the 3D form they did(by a Tier 2 Formed God{proposed to be a evil alien god creating us just for entertainment purposes}
5. Sorry the last point was long, it was crucial information that is a primary building foundation in the grand theory. So next point to mention is that we could also be created by a tier 3 formed god, but for the purpose of keeping things simple where they don’t need to be complicated we will say it’s a tier 2(but when I first thought of this theory I speculated we were created by a tier 3 god that forgot about us since human bodies are flawed{but not to ignore the fact that they are amazing pieces of technology, just how we work and can recover from small cuts[not missing arms though]})
6. Another supporting point to introduce my grand theory is, we were created for entertainment purposes. Our tier 2 formed god creator got bored because I guess it gets boring when you have to be awake for 1 trillion years , so he/she created us so he can view our daily activities and kill time that way (another point which points at the observation that our god is evil and not good is that he was definitely faced with the common dilemma as a creator which is “should I give my creation as much power as me? Or should I give it just less enough so I can be superior and rule over it?”. This is a common dilemma which a creator/business/inventor/manager/masterminds/superstars/idea sellers have to face in one form or another. Maybe this could have “leaked” through from gods anonymity to our reality by “as above, so below”, we replicate what already exists.
7. Also I am a strong believer of “as above, so below”. You see it everywhere through all practices of life. In the small things and big things. Fractals and the Fibonacci sequence(golden ratio) are great examples. So I like to make a lot of assumptions and speculations off things I notice in daily life such as our human body for example, you can assume that if this is our body maybe this is our gods body. Another example which is slightly scientific is, the planets in a universe use gravity to maintain space in a circle, and particles in an atom also use gravity to maintain space in a circle.
8. Another point which is kind of scary and gave me some nightmares when I first came about realizing it’s a fact (a fact which most people overlook, also isn’t talked about much, and the importance of it’s negative impact isn’t considered as much as it really should). So the self-evident fact is that we’re trapped in reality. “We”, being our soul/mind/consciousness whatever you prefer to call it. We weren’t given an option to be born, we were just birthed and forced to live and comply with ruling regulations which first come about as a foreign entity to the knowledge of a child. We weren’t given some type of remote to teleport back to our home base(since newer technologies are always emerging, the modern youth are programmed into thinking everything comes easily and is a click away{500 years ago thinking things were a click away would be absurd to think of}, and a remote to teleport back to some sort of pre birth head quarters is what the tech savvy modern day youth would expect by default(but no we were not given any remote or way to escape the confinements of our reality, like what if I want to take a break from life and chill in my headquarters until I felt comfortable (a place where time theoretically wouldn’t exist, so when you come back to your real life from your home base headquarters it would be like only 1 second difference in reality whereas maybe you’ve left for 5 years). Not to mention if you believe in reincarnation or not; if you do then you should wake up to the reality or possibility(considering god doesn’t take us by his side when we die and let us do anything we want which is what many would believe, but let’s speculate otherwise) that you/me are trapped in this cycle of birthed reincarnations, next life we might even be a fish and die 1 week in, the life after we might be a billionaire human. But we are “trapped” into “living”, we don’t have an option to pause living. We can’t choose to be god if we wanted to(which adds to the momentum of the theory that our god is evil and not pure kpop)(but like I mentioned I have never seen this evil god alien theory mentioned or referenced to anywhere before so maybe, just maybe, if more people wake up to this fact and there is a evil god out there that keeps his stats in check as to where the progress of humanity is, maybe he will see the demand and awareness rising in people/consciousness want a different type of reality then it can 100% be achievable). Because an evil god that knows his creations are unaware of the evil reality their “soul” is being “forced” to “live” in can continue living that way, but if we become aware maybe we can bring about a change and secondly change primary foundational patterns in how we live.
9. Why does murder , rape , poverty , disease exist if God is perfect ? Why does one of God’s creature not have anything to eat all day and live with that fact that maybe he’s just unlucky? In a theoretically perfect world created by god, a person born would come with all the necessities they would need for the rest of their life. 
10. Our God(theoretically proposed evil god alien) had to add some excitement to the entertainment he is viewing(which is us). So all the high tech technology(maps, books, clothing, housing, hardware tools, natural resources, computers, TVs, cars) we have today was introduced by secret intervention so watching us isn’t so dull and boring. (This theory also works with the theory that all the technology we have is reverse engineered old alien technology)
11. It is very difficult to say we were created by accident. Look at our bodies, the capabilities of our minds is unbelievable, our human senses, everything has to be designed by an intelligent being(but for what purpose? My claim is that it’s for the creators entertainment purposes, which leads the creator to be evil by default)
12. I’m not trying to say god is evil entirely, maybe he does have good in him. But STILL we shouldn’t ALLOW ourselves to be FOOLED into thinking our creator/god is entirely pure. Because I’m a believer of god of myself. I have only good things to say about him, but I just ponder things about his existence often.
13. Coincidentally EGAT which is my acronym for my theory which means Evil God Alien Theory, the word can also be seen or used as another purpose which coincidentally has to do which my theory and the first explanation of the word also, which is “gat” is a synonym for gun, and the preverb to egat which is “e” usually means digitally or electronically. So literally EGAT could mean an electronic digital gun that our creator used to “blast” us into existence

Additional Possible Side Theories 

1. God has set this dimension up so no one actually really dies, although we may see the person or animal actually dying but this theory claims that god interferes right before and switches the reality to a parallel universe(could be due to the fact that in the current universe that organism wasn’t succeeding or it’s surroundings weren’t in favour of it), so it shifts to a parallel universe where it continues living like nothing happened, and we witness a parallel reality in where that person did “die”. This theory is very far fetched and technically could claim that god is “cheating” this “game” of life
2. We meet god when we die and he lets us do whatever we want (low level theory which doesn’t focus on the possibility of the option to be birthed and in what form)
3. Individually different tier 2 Gods created the other intelligent beings in existence 
4. All our technology we ever have found including even writing instruments like pencils, maps, round tires, clothing, cars, computers, phones, is all reverse engineered alien technology
5. Does god live inside all of us(small voice in the back of your head)
6. God himself created us and threw us in a dimension of numbers meaning close to infinite possible plausibilities, only for the sole purpose of making his entertainment more high quality

Problems : 

1. It is unsure if Tier 1 God who birthed the Tier 2 God share the same mind consciousness or not (this would imply they are technically the same being but in a different form / my theory is based on the sole assumption that the Tier 2 God is a different conscious being / but this specific point is listed only so it can be discussed)
2. Are the evil species of Gods prevalent over the pure species of Gods?
3. Why did god birth us? Did god birth us?

religion,I believe in God but why do I feel more connected to other spirits?,"Or feel the other spirits more in general. And I feel that different spirits have different abilities that can be useful or they envoce . 

For example I've had many experiences where I escaped a bad car accident by a second. And it's happened too often for it to be coincidence. When that happens I feel like an angel has been present. And I'm not talking about typical traffic accidents where I feel protected. Because my car has a few dents here and there . I'm talking about a truck almost driving into my car or me crashing into another car. Sometimes I know it's because I paid good attention but when I'm tired and this happens I believe there must have been an other entity present. And in these cases I associate angels. I always thank god but I feel that angels were present. Do you understand what I mean? 

Moving on to more darker things. There been times when I felt extremely angry and could hardly contain myself. After my outburst I feel as though a demon has entered my body and left. I don't feel this way all the time when I'm angry but sometimes it feels as if it's Someone Else making me react or say certain things. I'm not trying to deviate from my responsibility. It's just a feeling. In these cases I feel like demons are present . Not the devil though? Isn't that strange. 

I feel that god delegates certain things to angels just like the devil delegates certain things to demons. I don't know if they carry out all acts themselves do you get what I mean? And maybe other spirits are more easily accessible. 

Whenever I feel watched I do sometimes feel it's god watching me but often I feel it's either good spirits, Jinns or demons.

religion,Ten Distinguishing Features Of Hinduism,"1. Belief in Atman, the Individual Self
          - In Hinduism, an individual soul is called Atman, meaning that which breathes. The Atman is eternal, indestructible, infinite, without qualities and imperfections. Hence, it is more correctly called the individual Self rather than a soul. According to Hinduism, all living beings, including animals, birds, insects, and other creatures, possess souls. For the soul, the body is a mere cover or clothing, which it discards at the time of death. Since the Self is different from the body and the mind, it can be known only in a transcendental state when the mind and the senses are inactive and silent.

2. Belief in Brahman the Supreme Self
          - Brahman is the highest deity of Hinduism. He is described in the Vedas as the God of gods, the supreme, absolute, eternal, indestructible, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, supreme Self. He is both known and unknown, with form and without form, creator and the created, who is hidden in all as their very essence (Paramatma). He can be realized through self-realization only, and those who attain Him thus are forever freed from rebirth and mortality. At the highest level, Brahman manifests in creation as the Lord of the Creation (Isvara), the Soul of Creation (Hiranyagarbha), and the Body of Creation (Viraj).

3. Belief in gods and goddesses
          - Hindus worship hundreds, if not thousands of gods and goddesses. Each of them also has aspects, manifestations, emanations, incarnations, projections, associated deities, and attendant deities, which make the Hindu pantheon very colorful, and diverse. These deities reside in several upper worlds of light, and participate in creation as the rays of Brahman, spreading light and delight, keeping darkness away, and helping the humanity to do their part. According to Hinduism, the gods possess miraculous and supreme powers. However, since they are selfless, they do not make food for themselves. Hence, humans have a duty and an obligation to make them regular offerings and oblations to nourish them and keep them strong.

4. Belief in Trimurthis (Trinity).
          - The most popular gods of Hinduism are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. According to the Vedas they are aspects of Brahman only who carry out the three principal functions of existence namely, creation, preservation, and destruction. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer. At the beginning of creation, Brahma creates the worlds and beings, and imparts to them the knowledge of the Vedas and how to perform their obligatory duties to keep the worlds going. Vishnu acts as the preserver and protector, and maintains the order and regularity of the worlds thus created. At the end of creation, Shiva destroys the worlds and withdraws everything into himself. Although, functionally the three are separate, each of them is Brahman only in their highest aspect and worshipped as such by their followers.

5.Diverse Literature
          - Our knowledge of Hinduism comes from several scriptures, which are divided into revelatory (sruti) and intellectual works (smriti). Chief among them are the Vedas including the Upanishads, the Agamas and Tantras, the law books, the two epics (Ramayana and Mahabharata), the Puranas, the six Vedangas, and several sutras such as Grihyasutras, Yogasutras, Bhaktisutras, Brahmasutras, etc. Apart from these, there are Gitas (divine songs) such as the Bhagavadgita, and the Astavakragīta, commentaries (bashyas), ancient plays and dance dramas, vernacular literature, poetic works, philosophical treatises, and hundreds of secular works related to various professions and fields of knowledge such as astrology, music, dance, drama, astronomy, anatomy, hunting, metallurgy, mathematics, cooking, art, architecture, iconography, construction of ritual places, temples, and houses, medicine, and chemistry.

6. Complex rituals
          - Hinduism has a complex set of rituals that are as ancient as the earliest traditions of Hinduism. Some are daily rituals, and others are weekly, fortnightly, monthly, annual, or performed once in every few years such as the Kumbhmela. Hindus perform their rituals at home, in temples, and sacred places. The rituals go by various names, such as puja, arati, yajnam, homam, vratam, vandanam, stuthi, and nirajanam. Some involve recitation of simple prayers, and some require elaborate arrangements and the assistance of knowledgeable priests. Some fire rituals are so complex that they may take years to perform and cost a lot of money, as the ritual-places have to be built in phases according to strict measurements and geometric calculations, and offerings have to be made at specific time intervals, and at particular auspicious moments (tidhis). There is also a provision in Hinduism to perform the rituals either physically or mentally or both. The rituals are meant to invoke the gods, nourish them, and obtain their help for children, peace, prosperity, success, protection from harm, good luck, and salvation.

7. Belief in the cyclical nature of creation
          - According to some schools of Hinduism, Brahman has two primary states, the wakeful state (nimesa) and the deep sleep state (animesa). When He is awake, time (nimesa) is activated and creation manifests out of Him as a projection, superimposition, or transformation like the web of a spider. When He is asleep, everything is withdrawn, and time becomes timeless (animesa). In the time of Brahman, these are but brief moments, like the opening and closing of his eyelids, but for us each creation lasts for billions of years. Just as days months and years recur in our calendar, creation is also a large time unit that lasts for a long time bur recurs regularly. As surely as each day is followed by night, each creation cycle is followed a period of total inactivity during which everything remains in a primordial and latent state.

8. Belief in Mother Goddess
          - Belief in the Mother Goddess, Shakti, Devi, Universal Mother, or Mother Nature (Prakriti) is one of the most distinguishing features of Hinduism. Brahman is the Self of the universe and of everything present in it, while Shakti is the energy in them without which there can be no movement or activity (chaitanyam). It is shakti who is responsible for the movement of the breath and all the functions in the body. She is both matter (mathar) and energy (shakti) and manifests in numerous forms as energies and dynamic forces (shaktis). Like Brahman, she is also eternal, infinite, and indestructible. If Brahman is the Supreme Will, Shakti is the Will in action. If Brahman is the soul, she is the body. For creation both are important. All the goddesses in Hinduism are considered manifestations of Shakti only. Each of them is traditionally associated with a corresponding manifestation of Brahman. Prominent among them are Sarasvathi, Lakshmi, and Parvathi, the consorts of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva respectively. Each of them has several alternative names, aspects, manifestations and associate deities. They are worshipped either independently or along with their consorts. There is also a sect of Hinduism, called Shaktism, which recognizes Shakti as the Supreme Ultimate Reality and creator of all.

9. Belief in karma and rebirth
          - In Hinduism karma is the fruit of your actions, which arises not as a substance, but as an effect. When you perform actions out of desires, and assume ownership and responsibility for your actions, as if you are the doer who is separate from God, you usurp the power and the role of God, and thereby become responsible for their consequences. Both your good and bad actions, and so also your actions and inactions, produce karma. The karma you incur is of several types. Some you exhaust and some you incur in this life, and the total of what is left unexhausted is carried forward to your next life. Thus, the karma you accumulate over several lives is responsible for your rebirth and any positive or negative consequences that arise from them. The unexhausted karma accompanies the soul as latent impressions (samskaras) and form the seed for your destiny in future lives. Karma cannot be extinguished unless you renounce doership and your desire for the fruit of your actions.

10. Belief in liberation
          - Since a person is bound to the cycle of births and deaths due to the ongoing nature of karma, he cannot escape from it unless he achieves complete liberation. This is called mukti, moksha, or nirvana, which is the highest goal of any human being upon earth. Liberation means liberation from the hold of Nature, from the compulsion to have a body, from the tyranny of desires, and from the limitations to which you are subject. It is a return to your original state, which is the state of your inner Self, or Atman. According to Hinduism, liberation is the highest and ultimate goal of human life. Only one in a million, after innumerable births, comes to the realization that he has suffered enough through births and deaths and has to escape from the bonds of life. Liberation can be achieved only by renouncing worldly life, overcoming desires, cultivating detachment, developing God consciousness, leading a God centric life, acquiring right knowledge through study, practicing virtue, and spending one's time in contemplation and devotion to God.",1605674448.0

Basically, she thinks that the original meaning of this verse was about pedophillia until the Catholic Church changed the meaning which was then adopted Christianity, etc.

religion,I wish to be convinced of Gods existence.,"I mean this sincerely. I spent my teens as a hardline atheist, these eight years I’ve spent in my twenties has seen me reading and growing more and more. 

I find myself in the position of being some level of agnostic, maybe almost agnostic theist? I found C.S. Lewis to be intriguing in his “Mere Christianity”. Really I have found myself in this odd position of wanting to be convinced but not just accepting something to satisfy this urge or want. I don’t want to be disingenuous to myself or others. I would really enjoy reading thorough arguments positing the existence of God and their involvement in our lives or reality. Obviously there is no completely certain argument or these discussions wouldn’t happen but there are definitely points to be made that can move someone closer to one side of the spectrum of belief. 

I don’t intend to debate anyone myself, I genuinely want to see what arguments or information can be posed to help me feel more clearly about this subject. 

As a point, atheists maybe need not apply for this particular post. Not because I don’t value the counter arguments but because I’ve immersed myself more thoroughly in Atheist and agnostic arguments for a longer period of time. I’ve read Dawkins and Hitchens, watched their debates. I’m thoroughly familiar with Bertrand Russell etc etc. so it isn’t that I don’t respect the counter argument but rather that I want to see the other side much more clearly. Though of course I can’t stop anyone from arguing or debating with others in the comments so whatever happens, happens.

And Latter-day Saints herald the Book of Mormon, even placing their faith in it in terms of conversion for others.

A second definition is “a system of ... ritual.” One of the practices of the church is the endowment ritual in the church’s temples.

Also, other definitions of ""cult"" in the dictionary are ""a religion regarded as unorthodox.” You could argue that the church is ""unorthodox"" because of various beliefs, including that God has a penis and that members in good standing will become just like God.

Basics ( just so I don't have to write this multiple times):

Dualistic theology of 2 eternally existing regions and entities, one pure good and full of light ruled over by the Father ( God) and the other Dark and evil ruled over by the devil and his demons. The devil once looked beyond his darkness and in the distance glimpsed the light of God and became Jealous and wished to usurp that light for himself. 

He invaded the world of light and in the ensuing battle between good and evil the universe was created and Good and evil was mixed, the light of God was trapped in by darkness on earth by the demons who then created the first Humans and imprisoned the light in them, Satan corrupted them with darkness causing them to forget their divine origin. God taking pity on his trapped light and his children sent down the Jesus ( An emanation of God) and caused the tree of life to grow. The demons seeing this tree came to the humans and said that they were God and that they were forbidden from eating from the tree.

Jesus then convinced the humans to eat from the tree which returned to them the knowledge of their past and the fact that they had been tricked by Satan and his minions.

God then sends many messengers to confirm and continue the message, cheif among them being

religion,Protestant and Catholic Religion in the USA,"I am from a very secular northern European country where it seems that most citizens are agnostic. It also seems that religion and religious faith is frowned upon by the millenlials especially. The church communities are rapidly dissolving in the big cities and the only religion that is still going strong in the country is Islam.

These are statistical facts. Check out Eurostat for more information.

So that is the back story and this is the question;

Some research has shown that an increase in welfare and GDP per capita has a negative effect on faith. If this is true then that might help explain why religious faith is dwindling in northern Europe since this is the part of Europe that offers the most stability to it's citizens in terms of welfare and opportunity. 

So my question is why the religious faith in the USA is still so incredibly strong? I think I read in the Economist once that the average US citizen is more pious than the average Saudi Arabian. 

My thoughts on this matter is that the USA does not guarantee much for it's citizens, which is to say that you are mostly left to your own devices if something goes wrong since fending solely for one self is supposedly part of what freedom is about.

Thus, the fact that stability is something that is not offered by the government let's religion be the provider of this. The churches and their respective communities will then act as the safety nets for it's members and,via agreements, to other adjacent community members. Faith and contribution is expected in return for the stability the church provides. 
This is how medieval Europe used to work and is most likely how most 3rd world countries work today. 

This thought implies that ill governance, poor/corrupt economies  and no stability for the citizens is a large part of the root cause to why religion is so important to the lives of humans in the 21st century.

Do you agree with my theory to why religion is still so important in the US and many other 3rd world countries? If not, then please leave your own thoughts on the matter 🙂

religion,Why is inter-faith religion considered bad?,"My boyfriend is Muslim and I am Catholic. His family has been against our relationship from the very beginning because I told them that I am not planning to convert. We have also been insistent on our plan to have a civil marriage and respecting each other's religion then teaching our future children the core values of both religion and have them choose their path when they are old enough.

My boyfriend and I just attended a Knowing Islam session and learned that basically Muslims and Catholics have the same God, ancestors (Adam and Eve, Noah, Abraham, Solomon, etc). I asked the teacher about this and he agreed that my understanding is correct but that things change and now God has decided to have us follow the path he has sent the prophet Muhammad and lead an Islamic life.

There were other inter-faith couples our age in the session who asked about civil marriage and the teacher said that having a civil marriage is not valid because it is not done in the religious way or in the eyes of God. So, even when our country allows civil marriage between a Muslim and Catholic, it is still wrong and even sinful.

If both religion is following the same God and core values (aside from certain rules like eating pork, etc) why does one have to convert in order to get married? Also, if God is an all-powerful being, why would having a civil marriage not be under the eyes of God and not be valid?

religion,"Purgatory is an Encouragement, not a Punishment/Threat","I'd like to preface this by clarifying what I mean by ""Purgatory,"" because I know that it has the connotation of ""conscious torment for the expiation of personal unrighteousness"" and that's not really what I'm getting at.
I mean, rather, the final purification of the individual of any/all corruption which they were unsuccessful in overcoming in themselves in this life. And here, I think, is the rub.

Seen from this perspective, the concept of Purgatory is not any kind of threatening or something to be avoided, but rather something to be *thankful* for; and a thing to hold on to in hope. Here is what I mean. 
Personally, I have a great many internal problems with my own corruption which greatly trouble me, and which I attempt (a little at a time) to overcome and subdue to the good (God's will). However, the nature of this struggle is that it is a gradual process of sanctification; and that means it takes time. If I should fail to overcome all darkness within myself in this life, it makes me rather happy to consider that I will receive a purification of all that remains of darkness in myself at or after my hour of death (whatever the case may be). 

Total purification of oneself is a thing to be desired, and consequently; I think the concept of purgation is one that has (unfortunately) gotten a bit of a bad rap, and been a fair bit misunderstood. However it may work (and specifics are difficult to pin down), it is; in the last resort, the perfecting of an individual to the highest that they possibly can be (as silver tried in a furnace). It may, in it's way, be ""unpleasant;"" but only as surgery is unpleasant, or psychotherapy where one confronts something painful within is unpleasant.

It is, in the final tally, an encouragement that anyone at all; no matter how much unfinished business they may have had, can still be made fully whole in the end, and I think that it (as a teaching) is simply hard done by; because of our tendency to think of the spiritual in terms of the earthly. We think of it as the punishing of sin, when in reality it is the purification of the soul. Not the scourging of retribution, but alcohol on a gash to cleanse any infection. A brief unpleasantness for one's health, but not a Punishment.

They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. **9** The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. **10** They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. **11** They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, **12** and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.

**13** Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. **14** Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle.

**15** “Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them. **16** “They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the Lord in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the Lord’s people. **17** Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, **18** but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.

**19** “Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives. **20** Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.”

The Israelites basically massacre the midianites thereby breaking the commandment - ''You must not murder anyone'' (or in another translation - ''Thou shall not kill''), so why didn't God punish them for this? Also after the Israelites massacred the midianites, Moses becomes angry with the Israelite soldiers because they didn't kill the midianite women, like wtf? As if wiping out the midianite men wasn't enough, Moses (the leader that God chose for the Israelites) wants the children and (non-virgin) women of the midianites killed as well! Why would God Almighty (who is supposedly\* omnibenevolent and omniscient) select Moses as leader of the Israelites knowing ahead of time that he will order such an atrocity? But then again, I suppose it makes sense that God wouldn't punish the Israelites for this massacre, after all they are his ''chosen (favourite) people'' so ofcourse they can break the very commandment that he gave them . Also Moses telling the Israelites who were involved in the massacre to ''purify'' themselves doesn't make much sense, as if that is supposed to get rid of their murderous act smh............. (NOTE - the midianites do reappear later in the bible though in the book of Judges.......................)  Then again the entire old testament might just be metaphorical or entirely allegorical so knows for sure.",1604102726.0
religion,Looking for resources on religious groups which would stress rationality,"I'm mainly interested in philosophies &amp; communities which combine rationality and spirituality.

religion,The Early Synthesis,"The antiquity of Hinduism can be better estimated from the astronomical evidence available in the Hindu scriptures, folk-traditions, anthropological studies which focus upon the sociocultural aspects of the Indian sub-continent and the geographical and etymological references which are mentioned in the Vedic literature. They suggest that the faith which we understand today as Hinduism may have a long and checkered history of at least 6000 years or more. It is true with regard to the folk traditions of the early human settlements of the Indian subcontinent which have now become a part of it.

Whatever may be the truth, some core beliefs of Hinduism were derived from the Vedic religion, also known as Brahmanism, which thrived in the Indian subcontinent around 2500 BCE. Its core doctrine was derived from the Vedas and from the derivative knowledge of the Vedas, of the which the Rigveda is considered the oldest. It is a voluminous work, which is divided into ten books or large sections (mandalas), and which may have been composed in its present form over many centuries.

Early Vedic people lived in the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent. We do not know whether they had any connection with the Indus Valley Civilization. It appears that Vedism thrived along with the Indus Valley civilization for some time and continued to thrive following the decline of the latter. We do not know whether there was any interaction or integration between the two. Subsequently, Vedic people migrated from the Sindhu-Saraswathi region (modern Thar desert) to the plains of the northern and central India. We do not know reasons for the migration. It might have happened due to climate change aggravated by desertification, drying up of the ancient River Saraswathi and prolonged drought. The Vedas themselves do not reveal much about these historical events. However, they do throw considerable light upon the people who practiced the faith, their customs, beliefs and practices.

The earliest hymns of the Rigveda suggest that Vedic religion is very ancient. However, we do not know the true origins of the Vedic people who practiced it or how they gained importance. It is possible that they were a heterogeneous group who specialized in various professions. Some of them might have migrated from outside, and some might have joined them subsequently. Their social order consisted of four distinct groups namely priests, warriors, merchants and workers, based upon color, occupation or birth.

At some point, these social divisions became rigid, resulting in the emergence of birth-based caste system. The knowledge of the Vedas remained confined to the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas. The Brahmanas specialized in ritual knowledge, while the Kshatriyas in the spiritual knowledge. Many social and economic privileges were denied to the remaining two groups. Belief in karma and rebirth justified the divisions, upholding the idea that fate and destiny of people were shaped by their own actions.

The Vedas are considered revelatory scriptures by Hindus. Vedic hymns are products of a very ancient wisdom. They were composed in contemplative and intuitive states by ancient seers (rishis) who claimed Manu, allegedly the first man on earth or the ancestor of all humans, as their progenitor. The Vedic seers wisely used their religious knowledge to preserve and promote dharma with the help of a dedicated priestly class and faithful warriors, attracting new adherents through royal patronage and the aura cast by magical rituals and mystic practices. They also integrated many rival traditions of the subcontinent, either to placate new royal patrons or to strengthen the faith and broaden their appeal to attract more followers.",1603690686.0
religion,There are 3 main reasons why someone believes in a God.,"But first let's set the tone, a boy raised in an extremely conservative Christian home. Went to church every Sunday and Wednesday, got the adult version of the bible from the age of 8, not the children's class version every week. Homeschooled and read the bible from cover to cover multiple times. Believed because ""that's how I was raised"", encountered a tragedy and abandoned my belief system because how could God allow this to happen? Semi came back to the belief because there has to be a reason this happened! 

That's  when I truly started my search to find out if what I believed was worth believing. The search centered around the fact that there are other people that believe differently but go through the same ""crap"" that everyone else does and they still believe. 

Why is my belief right and theirs wrong? 
What are the differences? 
What do these different beliefs have to stand on historically? 
And if only one of them is right, why are their other beliefs? 
Why would people make up a God and strive to convert others to their belief system if it was not true? 
What is the purpose of a belief system? 
If there is only 1 true God why would it allow others to besmirch his title?

Now in my own life I do not hold a grudge for how I was raised or the events that took place and put me where I am. It is undeniable that a belief system (I will use this as an term in largely to replace the more known term of religion, as I don't believe that every definition of religion applies to what I was researching) was a large part of my life and had a ""interesting"" impact on where I am today. If you are frustrated with the topics below or at any part want to stop reading, please scroll to the very bottom to read my closing remarks before stopping. What I have to say might be difficult to read and understand but once again it is my views and where my journey and study has taken me. I highly encourage anybody reading this to do your own searching, if for no other reason than to prove me wrong and grow in your own belief system!

Now on to the condensed version of my search, findings, thoughts and opinions.

Main 3 reasons someone believe in a God.
1.  Tragedy - something unexplainable has happened (accident, rape, death, etc..)
2. Life/Creation - The person needs a way to explain how they and everything around them came to be and a random chance of evolution doesn't make sense to them.
3. Forgiveness - the person has done something that they will not(or can't) seek forgiveness for and they cannot forgive themselves for.

The fourth, and in my opinion an unacceptable reason, ""That's how I was raised"". 

We'll start with reason 4, this group from my experience makes up the majority of every belief system. They practice and abide by a belief system because that's all they have ever known. The person has never had the drive or will to really explore their own beliefs. Most of the time it takes one of the 3 main reasons happening in their life for them to start exploring and often times when a ""raised believer"" encounters one of these they abandon their beliefs because it is hard for them to imagine that their God would allow this to happen. There are a few that, without even thinking about it, blindly continue to follow their belief system as this is the only thing they know and to question it means death or exclusion from family and friends. These blind and uneducated (in the sense that they have never explored or studied other belief systems) are the most detrimental to any belief system (commonly called religion). These people when asked why they believe whatever they believe answer (as stated above) ""because that's how I was raised"" their intellectual understanding and ability to have an intelligent conversation regarding their beliefs is often negligible. But these people are often the majority of the group and the most die hard about how everything should work, while at the same time being the ones who break the ""rules"" more often than anyone else. These are the people the drive most of those truly searching and trying to educate themselves, away from that belief system. While often times these people ultimately will have good intentions their beliefs are skin deep and easily strayed away from and they have no real foundation upon which to stand or defend when questioned about their beliefs. I personally have a hard time with anyone who has not questioned their own beliefs and sought the answers to the tough questions they encounter. Every belief system requires a bit of blind faith! Why is your blind faith in your beliefs better than Joe's blind faith in his beliefs? Why are you right and he is wrong? The simple answer of ""that is how I was raised"", is hopefully, clearly an unacceptable answer!

Reason 1, in my experience the most common reason someone is drawn to a belief system. Tragedy, death, a destruction of what one considers normality. Comically this is also the primary reason that ""raised believers"" abandon their belief system, ""how could God allow this tragedy"", ""I did everything I was supposed to and God let this happen""... What these infant believers fail to realize is that no belief system guarantees peace, prosperity or a pain free life. Those searching are often drawn to an idea of higher purpose and reuniting with loved ones who have died through a belief system. Funerals are filled with sadness yet reinforce an ideal scenario that the deceased was a believer and if you too choose to believe you will be re-united in paradise. While death is the most common tragedy the drives people to a belief there are 100s of unexplainable events that happen to people every day that either drive them to search or drive them away from a belief system, accidents, natural disasters, rape, disease, the unfortunate bad event that happens to the ""innocent"". People develop a bleeding heart attitude towards whatever strums those chords. For some it's the cruelty towards animals, others the starvation of thousands of kids, while others it's the death of civilians in a war torn country, for some it's the death of a newborn from SIDS. What belief system can explain this or justify it in your eyes? For Christians you have an omnipotent God, present and knowledgeable everywhere at all times. There are hundreds of books dedicated to this topic so if you want to research feel free to do so! But it's a tough topic in every belief system, from my research none of the belief systems really have a great answer that would leave no doubt in a persons mind as to why these things happen. It comes down to the pure and simple fact that all people have a choice, to do good or to do bad... Without choices what purpose is there to life? If you are forced, not just compelled by a belief system, to do good, there is no belief... You do not have a choice in the matter and you are now a puppet. But what does this mean in the bigger picture? If no God can truly explain in their book why tragedies happen and why they as a God do not intervene, or why they allow tragedies and instead require an extensive library to explain ""why they allow tragedies"" is it a valid reason to believe? Bad stuff happens all the time to people in different belief systems and even those without a belief system(religion) in their life. People in these scenarios can go in any variety of direction. They can take it and grow from it, learn from it, embrace it as a turning point and focus on making their life better and to not let the event/circumstances define how they move forward. Other allow it to define them and typically spiral downward in every belief system and often easily defined by cultural standards ""lose control"". Let's end this with this simple question that you can answer to yourself, if your mother and/or father were murdered  in front of you should that define your life? Do you need a God to tell you that what happened was wrong and that you should not become a serial killer because of that?

Reason 2, how did you and I come to be? How are there still mysteries about our world and universe? If science is the reason that all of this came to be how come science cannot still explain it? Yes there are plenty of examples of evolution in fact even in the modern era people are evolving to be able to use cell phones and stay in contact anytime they want.. How many of you can not imagine the ability to instantly call/talk/text your friends or loved ones... It wasn't to long ago when this technology existed and now in the matter of a few years we are completely reliant on it in day to day activities.. In my opinion evolution is undeniable, but was it able to create to complete Eco-system that we live in today? Did evolution know that the world needed oxygen so it created the hundreds of different variety of trees that use complex science to turn CO2 into Oxygen? Or how a sperm is made and able to create another living being? We have elements but we with all our extensive knowledge cannot create sperm from nothing.. We can accelerate evolution, and Christians favorite argument... How are there still monkeys and apes... In my opinion this is one of the easier areas that people can take that leap of faith and believe that there is an all powerful being that intelligently created the earth and everything in it. It's not to far fetched when modern science is still trying to explain and recreate tiny parts of our world yet we can't solve or predict problems like drought, famine and natural disasters. So there has to be something greater out there that created all of this. Then we have to take it a step further.... If someone created all this, there has to be a reason.... There has to be some greater purpose! Why? We live on this intensely complex planet, 1 planet out of this little solar system, in this little galaxy called the Milky Way. Which contains thousands of other solar systems, as well as there being thousands of other solar systems... Stop and think about that for a minute... I mean it is super easy to think about the infinite power of a God by flying... Looking down from 26,000 ft and unable to see a single human being.. But able to see lights, and structures containing these other beings and according to the bible God knows the number of hairs on their head... It's inconceivable... So what makes me and you so arrogant that we are the only other living beings in the entire galaxy? This thought by the way is not new in quite a few Christian circles, but it's not highly accepted due to the fragility and arrogance of humanity. But with that being said, if you accept the fact that their might be life outside of our galaxy... Who is their God? Did they get their own savior? Buddha, Jesus, Mohammad? This is the paradox of creation... Undeniable yet fragile.. My crutch comes down to this part of the belief, I don't believe that this world is an accident a co-incidental chance of evolution to create the complex Eco system that I live in. The paradox comes down to the extent of our known universe, that we continue to discover is larger than we can imagine. And coming to terms with the fact that there might be, and more probably, is other life out there. Or we blindly look at the people around us and believe that every solar system, galaxy and the entire universe was created for us! I am not sure about you, but I am not that arrogant... But at the same time if there are multiple Gods within our solar system, I have to assume that within each Galaxy and solar system that had life they have their own Gods. Am I responsible for knowing those Gods? Is their savior the true one? Or is mine?  Or did God provide a separate ""son"" or prophets to provide salvation for each of these different people? Kind of mess's with your mind when the bible says you are created in Gods image... Does every other being also look like a human? In summary for this section it's one of the more difficult and controversial! There is no end of scientists who support one or the other, nor is there a shortage of opinions on life outside of earth. This topic regardless of which way you stand, in my opinion, requires blind faith, regardless of which way you decide. (Look up video of Google through galaxies). In my opinion this confirms the fact that there is a God.... Who else could have created all of these systems? But who would have created these systems without any purpose... No life, just barren planets unable of supporting life and just one little blue ball here in the Milky Way that all hopes are riding on. 


Reason 3, forgiveness, everyone at one point or another in their life has had to seek forgiveness. Whether it's for hitting a sibling or friend before we realize that was wrong. Or it's Jeffery Dahmer accused of rape, murder and dismemberment of 17 men/boys repenting and being baptized in prison. Yes these are extremes, but ultimately is there a difference in punishment in the sight of God for a wrong doing? In modern courts yes we have a scale of punishments. First degree, second degree, etc... But in the end is a sin a sin? Does the person who didn't ask for forgiveness for hitting his sibling have a lighter punishment than the person who raped or murdered? In the stricter belief systems they are no different... Both of the wrongs make you unfit to cross over into the better part of after-life. But suddenly if you ask for forgiveness from your God all is a-ok! Some will argue a repenting and turning from your ""evil"" ways. I.e. No longer seeing your sibling or being thrown in prison? Is one better than the other?  It strikes up an interesting conversation for sure! People always like a clean conscience and the catholic religion caters to this by allowing one to confess to a priest and donate or do religious rituals to atone for their behavior. Does this make them any more holy than you or I? Are they any more forgiven and worthy of acceptance into an eternal paradise? Is it good deeds and righteousness that get you beyond the pearly gates or is it an overwhelming forgiveness? I think everyone can admit that they are not perfect and with that in mind what does it take to atone for your imperfection? Is it good deeds, sacrifice, repentance, or is it impossible? Look at your own life and what people have done to you! What would it take for those that have wronged or offended you to get back in your good graces? Or is it even possible? Are there some people that no matter what has happened deserve to suffer eternally? Or do you possess an inhuman ability to forgive and forget? All in all this is the most personal reason people believe in a belief system. The person has generally come to a realization that they are no longer capable of living with themselves due to things they have done or have had done to them. These ""things"" differ from person to person, for some it is cheating on a loved one, others stealing, and still others murder... There is no definition of what one feels is the worst sin they have committed. But those that have ""gone past the line of no return"" cling to their belief system as a life line hoping it holds their life together and absolves them of the sin they have committed. Now for the devils advocate side of the story, did that person truly repent? Or are they avoiding confession to the party that matters by utilizing a God that will accept their confession and suppose repentance for their sin without immediate consequences? Yes some people confess to God and their loved ones.... But by no means do all... This is how some people live with themselves... They know they are sinners and for lack of a better term serial sinners and their confession of their sins without a lack of repentance and turning from is a false hope that a belief system can provide and in some instances encourages. Not publicly of course... But when was the last time you saw a catholic priest going to jail for child molestation??? They are accused, repent, and moved to another church... It becomes an enablement and an abused system for those who want to enjoy the ""glories of an afterlife"" but refuse to abide by the rules during their actual life.

Admittedly I have more knowledge and experience with Christianity and the other belief systems that center around Jesus. Which has an originating belief system of Judaism that foretold the coming of a savior (Jesus). The interesting part that I found in my research  is that the largest religion (Muslim) openly accepts Jesus and mentions him several times, but Christians and Muslim's have been at war with each other for centuries!!

Closing Statement:
I would like to say I apologize if I offended you... But to be honest I am not... If this offended you, GOOD, you need to search for yourself and find out ""why you believe what you believe!"" I personally hold no grudge or ill will towards believers of most belief systems. For the majority of them at a core level they teach a similar ideology of ""do unto others as you would have others do to you"". Now my question to you is,  do you think you need a belief system to know this? And has any belief systems teaching been 100% about this one simple code that should in my opinion be a no brainier? In my experience some people need something to believe in to help them get through life. Whether it's the hope of something greater, an ability to ""give"" your pain to a higher power, or that there is something more to life than the ""crap"" you have had to deal with. I honestly do not have a problem with the believers of a belief system, I just want to encourage those believers to truly know what they believe and to build a foundation upon which they can defend their beliefs when questioned. It's not an easy road to get on and will honestly surprise you the more you dig! I have come to terms after many years with my decision but at the same time I am open to questions, confrontation, and a continuation to learn and grow.

religion,Hinduism Is Difficult To Define,"It is an unquestionable fact that Hinduism is not a religion in the strictest sense of the word, but an ancient tradition in continuity and perpetual evolution. It was formed out of political and administrative expediency by the British, who artificially grouped all the native faiths of India under a single label, with little or no knowledge of them. Therefore, trying to define Hinduism is like trying to put the waters of an unfathomable ocean into a small vessel, or trying to capture the essence of human life in a few words or a single phrase.

With a structured definition we may be able to capture the essential elements of Hinduism and satisfy our intellectual curiosity. However, it is doubtful whether it will justify the significance of a tradition which began in prehistoric times and eventually grew into a complex system of religious and philosophical thought, which we recognize today under the generic name of ""Hinduism."" The faith has still been evolving and adapting to the new challenges and demographic changes caused by globalism, admission of many people from the West and the migration of millions of Hindus to numerous countries in all the continents.

Because of its expansive and comprehensive nature, Hinduism can be truly called an Asvattha tree, which is described in the Upanishads as the tree of creation, whose roots are above in the heaven, and whose branches are spread below in the world. The roots are the traditions that we inherited from the Rigvedic Aryans or their ancestors who laid the foundations of Vedic dharma. The branches are the various new schools, sects, philosophers and teacher traditions, which were subsequently incorporated into it during its long history. The trunk is the belief in the eternal nature of Self and the Supreme Self who are central to Hinduism. God is its founder, nourisher and sustainer.",1604034509.0
religion,Hinduism As A Colonial Construct,"Surprisingly, although Hinduism is a very ancient religious tradition, the word ""Hinduism,"" which today defines it and distinguishes it from the rest of the world religions, is of much later origin.

People belonged to numerous religious sects, ascetic groups, teacher traditions, and schools of philosophy, most of which subsequently became part of Hinduism due to historic reasons. The name Hinduism came into existence out of expediency to distinguish the native religious traditions of India from those which were practiced outside. Somehow the name stuck, much to the discontent of many modern Hindus who consider it a legacy of India’s colonialism and foreign subjugation.",1604637275.0

I believe animals have a consciousness different from ours, but a consciousness none the less

religion,Am I the only one seeing issues with a pre destined afterlife?,"I'm a neutral person when it comes to the afterlife.

Well as long as you aren't a negative pos then it seems like your soul is destroyed or you go to a negative afterlife for awhile.

But if you were rather positive in life, you end up doing the same thing endlessly, for all eternity. And in pagan religions with your ancestors doing the same thing for all eternity. Or with your loved ones, for all eternity. Or worshipping a god, which you shouldn't have to do, for all eternity.

OR you are at endless loop of reincarnations for all eternity. 

Either way it's broken

1.) Doing the same thing endlessly for eternity is torture. Also what if you don't want to be with your ancestors? Or don't like your birth family and want to be with the family you actually like as well as your loved ones? Or what if you were trans in life and hated your body and now you're stuck in that body for all eternity.

One person's heaven can be another person's hell.

What if the person was gothic and feels comforted by the dark, and paradise is all lovey dovey, white, pearly gates, with no rock music to be heard but instead harps. Well congratz you made that person hate the afterlife

Etc.

2.) And if you constantly being reincarnated after death, that again is hell. Because you won't remember anything from your past life. What you liked, loved, who you were, who you loved, making your past life meaningless. And always in a state of losing yourself.

And if the goal is to become a god eventually like in Hinduism, you still are being continuously reincarnated losing yourself and the ones you love.

So it's still hell.

religion,Sometimes I wonder about my own beliefs,"So when I say wonder, I don't mean my own feeling of belief. I moreso wonder about how I have so many ideas from so many plces that make sense together. 
 
I'll start out by saying I believe multiple things at once. I consider myself Omnist, Pagan, Luciferian, and PolyDeist all at the same time, all in different extents. Which will probably seem completely contradictory at first glance. So to explain: 
 
I believe all religions and mythologies have some bit of literal truth in them. Maybe not exactly as any one book claims, as humans have played 3000 years of spiritual telephone, but I do believe that the metaphysical exists beyond this physical world, and most begining religions have truth in their gods as a result. 
 
However, my definition for god is completely different than most people. To me, a god is anything that knowingly creates and/or rules over things. I consider humans to be gods in their own right, and animals as well. I consider the gods of various religions and mythologies to be gods in the same way on a bigger scale. I do not consider a god to be all knowing, all seeing, all good or evil, or ultimately creating at the level we think about it. To me, any one god could be a complete asshole and love human suffering, or want to make certain lives better but not others, so its never a question to me to be asked why god(s) can be so cruel.
 
Within me believing that all gods exist in one way or another, I do have my own personal pantheon I highly respect within my own psyche, but don't worship. While I could ask for help from my gods, I'd rather do it through my own will and power to do stuff within this world. My gods are also ones to make you do it yourself and actively throw you in tough situations they think you can handle, not necessarily know. 
 
And despite all my experiences and theories about life that I've only shared the very tip of here, I also realize I could be wrong. I could be completely nuts. And to be honest? I'm okay with that. We cannot prove or disprove any metaphysical aspects of what could be in our lives. 
 
Despite all my belief, to say I could be wrong so enthusiastically yet truthfully is something I question, because so many people I know cannot, which is strange because its something that can't be proven or disproven. It is something we will never grasp on a full scale until after death, if even then. So why worry? We all have our theories one way or the other, but I find a weird happines in the unknown whereas others don't.",1604530956.0

religion,No one understands the bible,"No one understands the Bible, because no one is honest. The story of the Garden of Eden is probably the most brilliant story in the history of this earth, and no one really cares. It has more valid interpretations than the fingers on your hands. Why does no one interpret it through an evolutionary lens? Obviously there was a first man and/or woman that was a step above the apes, and it happened through some elevation of consciousness. The apple is knowledge that rape is bad, experienced first by the woman and then realized by the man as she kills him in vengeance. The apple is knowledge of voluntary sex on the woman’s part, and she chooses which man she wants to dominate her. This man understands how to make women come to him. Then there’s the standard interpretation of shame and loss of innocence, which is fine. Maybe the apple is the gossip of women while the men are off hunting, the origins of language being gossip and then the naming of hunted animals. Maybe it’s knowledge that we’re vulnerable and so can hurt others, like Jordan Peterson thinks. 
Why is the tempter a snake? Because it manipulates. Why is it not human? Because manipulation is pure evil. What does the first woman do? Tempt. What does the first man capable of language do? Lie. It’s genius, and people write it off as a dumb fairytale.
You don’t believe in the virgin birth? What if I told you it’s a Schroedinger’s cat situation of Mary being raped or Mary cheating? Collapsing it kills the magic. Josephs’ act is gracious in both cases, and it shows that the perfect man is born of intense pain or treachery.
If the resurrection didn’t happen, Jesus is the antichrist because he fooled everyone into worshipping a man as a god. The reason he’s innocent is because he didn’t know he was sinning at the time of his sins, and then properly atoned for them upon learning so. He sinned when he thought he could cast out Satan, for you can never entirely purge evil from your heart, as Solzhenitsin knew. That was his moment of doubt on the cross. Had his perfectly led life led to his pointless suffering? He died for a principle, to love your enemy. And people think he preached weakness. 
Samson is seen as a hero. Samson is a story on how to get to hell. Let your woman walk all over you because you want to get laid, lose your strength and die in an act of vengeance.

religion,Parents making me read Quran but I don’t want to.,"I’m 19 years old and I come from a Muslim family. Before I get into the background, I do not believe in God and I don’t intend to but I absolutely respect those who do. 
Now for background- my parents did not do such a good job of teaching me about religion or taking me to the mosque as a kid. This of course shaped my beliefs but as I grew up I just couldn’t believe in some all-knowing being. 
But my uncle(father’s brother) is very religious and so is his family. They visited us this summer and it was quite fun but since they practice I had to read namaz, or pray, with them. I only copied their actions and learned some things from my uncle. 
And because of this my parents finally came to their senses and felt some regret not teaching me anything. So they put me in program where I will learn Arabic and eventually start reading the Quran. But I do not want to do this; I don’t believe in God and I don’t want to spend my time devoting time to become religious. Additionally, I’m a third year college student taking 5 STEM classes and an internship and I just can’t add this to my responsibilities.

That’s why learned behavior is so consistent right? i’ve gotten used to waking up everyday and brushing my teeth first thing. maybe i’ve also learned that it’s normal to pray and plead for things to a god and expect something in return which could create the placebo effect.

religion,About primates and other species of humans in religion.,"Almost all religions on Earth seem to have a special attention into the ""human"" and usually tend to be quite anthropocentric in it's vision, with Humans being the special selected species by God or the gods. And that species of human is, obviously, Homo sapiens, the only one that's currently living. However, in the past there were other species of humans moving around, Neanderthals, Homo erectus, Homo floresiensis, etc. Those species were very closely related to humans, and studies seem to confirm that, at least Neanderthals, were almost as intelligent as Homo sapiens. 

Even with that, there are some hypothesis that say that Neanderthals may have had some sort of religious practices, such as burying the dead with objects and stuff, showing that they may have believed in the afterlife, alongside others. This is not 100% concluded and there is debate, but shows that Neanderthals may have been as intelligent as Homo sapiens. So really, asking for religious people here, what does you faith think about Neanderthals and other human species? Were they part of humanity, or just were another branch of animals? If suddenly we discover that Neanderthals have survived to the modern day, isolated in some place, we find a group of pure Neanderthals living, will they be able to convert and have religion? 

And, related to the animal thing, what about primates? Many people discuss the idea of granting personhood to big apes (That is, Gorillas, Orangoutans, Chimpanzees and Bonobos), which is an idea that I actually share myself. So, in that case, what do religions think of this?

religion,Is it wrong to keep my faith a secret from my family?,"It’s a precarious situation. I love my Lord AND my family who has done so much for me. A family given to me by the Lord Himself. I treasure both relationships.

Will Jesus forgive me and understand that I only pray to Him and read the Bible in private and never tell my family?

I was born into a Muslim family in the United States but I have fallen in love with His Word and I pray to Christ daily in my room with the door shut every morning. I tune in to online church every Sunday and I also have Bible study early in the morning a few times a week. I feel so much joy! I was never this enthusiastic about the Koran or Muslim traditions. Is that bad?

I could never ever tell my family because they are staunch in their faith and they would be devastated and I want to keep my relationships intact. They have done so much for me and I love them and I hold my relationship with them as sacred. Is it wrong that I choose to never tell them? 

A couple members of our community turned to Christ and they were disowned by their families and completely ostracized from everyone. My family also looked down upon them in shame. I don’t want to put myself in such a predicament. 

Is it wrong that the Bible makes me feel different compared to the Koran? I mean a good different. I feel so at peace. Is it wrong to never ever tell them? Is it ok and forgiveable to love and accept Christ in my heart alone? I don’t plan on going into ministry, so I don’t feel the need to share my faith (especially not with my family). I was just looking for a relationship with God that allows me to connect with Him on a deeper level and so that I spend my days in peace, which I didn’t have for a long time. I can already feel the transformation in my heart.

There are some aspects of Islam that just never resonated with me the way Christianity does:

I really dislike how Islam is practiced entirely in Arabic-reading, reciting, and praying in Arabic. Especially since I grew up in a family that does not speak Arabic. I also don’t like having to go through the mechanical motions (although truth be told I’m ashamed to say I never actually learned how to pray). I love the way Christians pray. Whatever is on your heart, you speak it aloud or silently. No matter what language you speak, the Lord hears it because He is an all-knowing God. He understands all languages. I can pray any way I want. 

I also love the concept of song as a form of worship in churches, through choir or worship bands. There is nothing like that in the mosque! I will say the Azan is beautiful and the Koran can be read in a melodious way, but I’m so drawn to actual worship songs. The Lord should be praised through music in song in a house of worship! 

I tried to read the Koran in English. The tone was entirely different. It felt like a rule book. Many of the stories are the same in both the Koran and the Bible. But in the Koran the stories are very short and disorganized, they are in different chapters. Whereas in the Bible, it flows like a story which I love. 

Next I’d like to address the the relationship between God and man. In the Koran, I found many passages that mentioned how God’s love is conditional. There were many verses stating that God does NOT love liars, sinners, unbelievers, etc. (even though it does say He forgives and is merciful). Also the relationship between God and man is that of a Master and slave which did not sit well with me at all. There was a lot more emphasis on man proving their love for God through good deeds so that they get to Heaven. 

In Christianity, it’s so different. God’s love for man is unconditional, that of a parent’s love for a child, which is how I’ve always seen the relationship! 

That said, for a little while I tried to get into Sufism. You know, reading the world of Mystics such as Rumi. I still do read his works. I like Sufism because it focuses on the emotional and spiritual connection between God in man. In Sufism, God is indeed a father. 

But Sufism didn’t hit me the way Christianity does. I like Sufism, I LOVE Christianity. When I started reading the New Testament, I absolutely fell in love with Jesus Christ’s character. I knew that I wanted to follow His teachings. He was so humble, patient, loving, altruistic, and compassionate. I love reading about His miracles (and again this was mentioned in the Koran but doesn’t go into detail about His journey with His disciples). I love the concept of a God incarnate. I can easily put a face to God. And knowing that He walked among us, it makes Him so personable. I see Jesus as a true friend and confidante. In Islam, there is a veil between man and God. You can’t see Him (I get it, it’s supposed to be that way). 

I’ve always been so attracted to Christmas and Easter for some reason, more then Eid. I don’t know why! 

I’d prefer to listen to the sermons at the church I tune into every week instead of the sermons from Muslim clerics.

But I have so much love for Jesus Christ and it’s a love ive never experienced this before. 

I did read a bit about Muhammad and his followers in some of the Hadiths. I didn’t enjoy reading about these random Arab people like Abu Bakr, Uthman, Fatima, Aisha. I don’t know I just don’t acknowledge them. 

I even read about the account of Jesus in the Koran when he was supposedly not killed and raised to heaven instead, being replaced by someone else who was killed in his place. I had a weird feeling in my stomach afterwards. This account felt like a cop out. 

Sorry for the long post! I’d like to read your thoughts. This may sound weird but a close friend of mine who is Christian said there are many paths to God and I found my way through Jesus. This particular path gives me so much peace that I didn’t feel before. I could never tell me family though. I feel that religion is such a private matter and that it’s really no one else’s business. It’s between you and God. 

With that said, I still see myself a Muslim man because I don’t want to break away entirely from my family’s tradition. I still have an attachment to Islam because I was born into it. I’d have to tell my husband about it but I really hope he is someone who will accept me and be understanding about my spirituality and faith life. I would even like to introduce and have our children learn about Islam so that they know about their family tradition. If they decide to choose another spiritual path when they are older, I’d be ok with that. 

I love reading the Bible and praying to Jesus, it’s become routine for me now. I do it because I love it. When I had to read the Koran, I did it out of obligation or because it was something every other Muslim did.

religion,The Literary Sources Of Hinduism,"Hinduism has neither a founder nor a principal, sacred text. However, we cannot say that it has no scriptural basis. It is a religion with too many gospels. Although, Hinduism does not exclusively rely upon any particular scripture, it derives its inspiration from various sources, most of which are literary. The Vedas and the Agamas are the important sources among them. Apart from them we have the Vedangas, the Puranas, the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, the sutra literature, numerous commentaries (bhashyas), law books or Dharmashastras, the works of various schools of philosophy (Darshanas), literary and secular works such as those of Kalidasa, vernacular literature, the teachings of numerous Shaiva and Vaishnava scholars and spiritual teachers such as Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhava, the works of foreigners who visited India in ancient times, and so on. Traditionally, the Upanishads, the Bhagavadgita, and the Brahmasutras are considered the three most important sources (prastana traya) to corroborate or confirm the validity of any belief, truth or practice of Hinduism.

However, it is difficult to say the relative importance of each of these sources. The Vedas are undoubtedly the most indisputable sources of Hindu belief system. However, we cannot say that all Hindus regard them with the same respect and veneration. Those who practice Shaivism or Vaishnavism look to their principal sources. People who practice Tantra, draw their inspiration from the Agamas or the Tantras and may even totally ignore the Vedas.

While scholars and spiritual teachers may debate the relative importance of each of these works, the common Hindus may not even bother to read any texts. It is not an exaggeration to say that most of the Hindus may never read the Vedas, the Upanishads or any of the principal texts. Yet we cannot say that they do not know about their faith. They draw their knowledge from spiritual teachers, friends and relations, television programs, movies, movies and magazines. Some may even read the texts of other faiths such as Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism and appreciate the similarities and the underling unity. Most importantly, when you look at the masses of the Indian subcontinent who are either illiterate or poor, with little or no access to any literary information about their faith, you will realize the incredible and unquestionable impact of oral tradition and family practices upon their religious lives.

In Islam and Christianity, the Church and the State played an important role in enforcing the faith and ensuring that people adhered to the basic doctrine. They had the power to punish those who violated the established norms. Hinduism has some institutions which derive their authority from the scriptures or from the tradition, but their jurisdiction and authority are limited

Even if the kings of ancient India patronized Sanatana Dharma and took upon themselves the duty of enforcing the Dharma, it is highly doubtful how far they were able to extend their authority. The village heads and the higher castes enjoyed numerous privileges, but their power over the lower sections of the community varied in proportion to their own status in society. For all practical purposes, in the long and checkered history of India, the Hindu masses mostly remained outside the purview of any organized, religious authority.

They practiced their own gods according to their beliefs and family traditions and had their own unwritten code of conduct as dictated by custom, usage, and convenience. Yet, their loyalty to the traditions of their ancestors had been unquestionable. Theirs was a folk religion, which was based upon simple faith. However, they too were Hindu who could easily relate to any discourse or mythological story from the Puranas or the epics Ramayana or the Mahabharata.",1604982836.0

religion,Cultural Bias,"The early work on Hinduism was mostly done by foreign scholars, who had limited knowledge and understanding of the native traditions. It led to many distortions and misrepresentations in the construction of Hinduism, history and theology. Those distortions continue to leave their influence upon the academic studies even today, especially outside India, as people take advantage of the freedom Hinduism gives to interpret its tenets according to their personal agendas, limited knowledge and cultural bias.

Hinduism is also known as Sanatana Dharma (eternal religion), a name which has become more popular in post independent India as a nationalist response to address the distortions of Hinduism caused by the works of secular scholars. The justification for it is that the main source of the knowledge of Hinduism is God himself and that knowledge (Vedas and Tantras) said to exist eternally in the highest heaven. Besides, the obligatory duties which are enshrined in those works are considered to be the duties of God himself, which he performs to ensure the order and regularity of the works and which he delegates to gods in heaven and humans upon earth. It is also true that the knowledge contained in the scriptures of Hinduism helps humans achieve eternal freedom through liberation (Moksha).

According to the Vedas, the eternal tradition, which is founded by none other than God himself in the very beginning of creation, is meant to be practiced by not only humans but also gods, demons and celestial beings. All beings who are bound by the eternal laws and instructions of God (Dharma) are its adherents, whether they practice it or not and know it or not. Those who selflessly and dutifully abide in them upon earth are liberated, while those who engage in selfish and desire-ridden actions, ignoring such duties remain bound to the cycle of transmigration and continue to suffer.",1605934665.0
religion,Christianity and Marijuana,"I reciently started smoking a little pot for chronic knee pain, and have found it very helpful. However, I have noticed a really great side effect for me.

Marijuana helps me to be more mindful of my relationship to God.

I am a lifelong Christian. Raised in the Baptist faith, holding to the primary beliefs of the Christian faith. I even went to Seminary for two years (I just could not get Greek verbs). I now attend a non-denominational Christian church.

So the bottom line is I no longer believe that weed is a sin. In fact I now see it as one of the best methods for meditating on the word. I find, and remember, connections between sections of the Bible that I had never previously put together before.

I see no mention of smoking in the bible, much less a prohibition on marijuana specifically. Furthermore, with the most prominent side effects being hunger, sleepiness, and a general uplifted mood, with the rare effect of paranoia (which is mostly determined by your brain chemistry, and the strain of cannabis one smokes), I find it hard to believe that God would be against it.

Has anyone else experienced a closer connection with God while smoking marijuana? I'd really like to know. Also, if you find a legitimate, biblically based, objection, I'd like to hear from you as well.

religion,To the muslims here: let's talk,"So even though I've left Islam now, I'm still not sure if I did the right thing. Maybe its just an irrational fear.

I'm an 18 yr old male living in Europe. From the age of 12, I have been constantly doubting and questioning Islam. I have a loving family and they are devout muslims. But I just couldnt bring myself to believe in something without any logical reasoning or proof backing it. So how did the doubts turn into disbelief? For years I didnt pursue my doubts and just told myself that there is something showing Islam to be true. I believed in stuff like the scientific miracles in Quran, prophet's predictions or just personal experiences.

However, this year I finally gave in and sacrificed a lot of time do some research. To find out if what I believed was valid. I looked up the 'miracles' and predictions and I dont think they hold up for varying reasons. I tried to look up anything else that would show Islam is right. Nothing that convinced. There are also facts that I think straight up go against Islam, like evolution, the moon splitting and more. Reaching 18 years now, I have decided that if there is actually nothing showing Islam to be a fact. I wont believe in it. Regardless of my beliefs however,  I've always liked learning about religions, cultures etc..

Now I identify as an agnostic. I believe since religions are claims without proof, I can dismiss them without requiring proof. However I guess there is still a chance that some sort of god-like entity exists. My younger sister knows and is always poking at my beliefs, finding new things to convince me. Its because she cares and it does add to my doubts about leaving Islam.

So as an attempt to leave no stone unturned, I wanna talk to you about it. I want to discuss what you think backs up Islam and why I should believe in it. Try to convince me. I wanna know if there is something I'm missing. Online is the only safe way I can ask a large group of people questions like this. PM me or just comment, whatever you feel like.

I am genuinely open to Islam. If you say something convincing, you can change my views. I've already done that before.

You obviously can't convert me over a reddit convo, but it might answer my questions and set me in the right direction. Plus I'm always interested in what makes people believe.

religion,Was Christianity having a human God a key factor in why was practically adopted by European pagans and why Islam had difficulty making headway to Europe?,"Arguing from the perspective of history, anthropology, and other social sciences........................................................

If you observe most cultures across the world, they either worshiped animals or humanoids combining the features of various animals and humans (like the Egyptian gods having animal heads and human bodies). And some cultures had an approximate equal mix like how Chinese deities are animals, humans, and hybrids. Even gods that appear human at first glance often have very something that doesn't feel human about their appearance-just look at statues of Astarte with its red eyes or statues of Baal which have unrealistic proportions.

Greco-Roman civilization however seemed to be an outlier in that almost all the gods basically designed to resemble realistic human beings. Look at Greek sculpture and Roman mosaics of their various gods. Hell even barbarian European civilizations before conquest like Rome such as the Gauls and Brittanic worshiped primarily human deities with art that tried to come as close as their technology and limited sciences allowed them to.

So I have to ask. At the huge risk of making big generalizations and leaving out plenty of nuances, is one reason why Christianity eventually won in Europe and still remains there today is because Christianity is already compatible with European culture and civilization in the theological sense? After all Jesus is the GOD who is HUMAN. Greco-Roman and Europe as a whole West and North of Italia seemed to be obsessed with human-looking Gods. Even when pagan gods were borrowed from Egypt and other civilizations, it was almost always human-looking ones like Isis that were co-opted into Greek and other European civilizations and some of the non-human ones were modified to appear like normal humans as seen in the transfer of Zoroastrian concepts into Europe.

I also wonder if this is a big part of why Islam had so much difficulty penetrating Europe? With its emphasize of God as all-omnipotent and iconoclastic theology, was it so hard for Europeans to attempt to adapt esp seeing how so much of European art masterpieces even after the Protestant Reformation revolved around painting or sculpting humans? Even much of Pagan architecture often had normal humans as part of ceilings and such and this can be seen later in Medieval Europe with glass stains of Mother Mary and the Crucifixion and so on.

While from what I seen pre-Islamic Middle Eastern architecture often focused on monstrous creatures and architectural elements like specific candle holders at parts of the roof as well as shaping walls and angles and stuff at certain ways like geometric proportions and so on.

Even in various Middle Eastern paganism, there was often the concept of a prime deity not easily interacting with humans and seen as too all powerful that are was rarely made as seen in Zoroastrianism and later in the monotheistic religion Judaism would form out of local paganism or at least the all powerful chief was far less emphasized for its human like qualities and more for its sheer power and even robotic like AI.

So does this explain why Judaism and Islam developed as they did and a major reason why Islam had difficulty charging into Europe (and for that matter India, China, and the rest of the world)?

Disregarding very specific points like persecution of Christians in the early AD, Constantine turning the Church into Rome's official state religion, conversion of Anatolia into Christianity during the Byzantine, etc was Christianity simply more in-line with core European culture esp Greco-Roman as by its worship of a man as God which the Greeks and Romans even Barbarians were already doing with their own gods?

I'm not even counting Holy Mary Mother of God and the thousands of canonized Saints (yes Catholics don't worship them but as they are humans and early converts like the Saxons often mistaken intercession with Saints as polytheism, it goes in-online with the worship of human gods and even inspires a completely different topic for another discussion!).

Is this a reasonable factor of why unlike churches in other places like North Africa, Europe embraced Christianity wholeheartedly and was very stubborn about keeping it? Like other cultures such as Tunisia despite becoming Christians cultural concepts had difficulty going in-line with previous pagan systems and Islam seemed more suitable with its invisible all-powerful solo deity in contrast to Western civilization's love for humanlike gods and goddesses?",1605987593.0

Not to mention the fact that she or anyone who is religious can go and proselytise in the country I live and barely anyone would stop that person anyways (since the country is Christian-majority, but has a mostly secular\* society). I don't think talking about one's religion (or to be specific, proselyting in secular schools is okay at all). Also she was almost\* advocating for a theocracy (specifically Christian Theocracy) which shocked me ngl, so this brings me to another issue that being, theocracy is NOT\* a good form/system of government since for example you don't know for sure (i.e. with certainty, at least I don't) that the govt officials of the theocracy are actually acting according to what their (supposed) God wants them to act like and secondly, a theocracy (for the most part) works for one religion only, even though a nation could have (if not would have) multiple religions, so discrimination against people of other religions and non-religious people (e.g. atheists, agnostics, etc...) would most likely happen, etc...............

Moreover, this is even more infuriating to me since it is an organisation (that belongs to an Abrahamic religion - which doesn't even originate in Nigeria begin with or doesn't even originate in West Africa) that is trying to subvert Nigeria's form of governance plus the fact that afaik, there are NO indigenous (or native) African Religions' adherents advocating for a theocracy. So if people that practice traditional African religions don't advocate for a theocratic sovereign state then what right does the IMN have for example to call for an Islamic government in Nigeria?! In addition, I don't want the activities/existence of the IMN to transform Nigeria into a new 'battleground' between Iran and the KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) since the two nations are already engaged in a 'proxy conflict' across the Middle East - [https://www.vox.com/2016/1/4/10708682/sunni-shia-iran-saudi-arabia-war](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/4/10708682/sunni-shia-iran-saudi-arabia-war)

. Also even though the conflict is predominantly political, it does have religious undertones\* which it concerns me that it could possibly 'spill over' into my home country (Nigeria). ((Sorry for including politics here, but this is worrying to me because of what could potentially happen since my nation already has a terrorist group (Boko Haram) which is ideologically aligned with Saudi Arabia since Boko Haram 'follow' Wahhabism and Salafi Jihadism as ideologies) and Saudi Arabia's official form of Islam is Wahhabism - The official and dominant form of Islam in the kingdom—[Wahhabism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism)—arose in the central region of Najd, in the 18th century)).

Finally, I hope I didn't even offend anyone this are just my ''raw'' thoughts concerning the anti-Secular attitude/sentiment from some\* religious people. Even though ironically, they wouldn't even be able to advocate for a govt that favours their religion if they were in a theocratic nation that worshipped another religion like Christianity instead of Islam for example, since that theocratic govt would most likely (IF\* not certainly) see them as a threat to its power imo and could eliminate them.",1605806876.0
religion,The Tradition Of Secrecy,"Hinduism is difficult to understand, even for those who practice it for long. Even the priests who are well-versed in the ritual knowledge of the Vedas and offer regular worship in the temples may not know the depths of its philosophy or the diversity of its beliefs and practices. Some practices and teachings of Hinduism are specific to certain sects and teacher traditions. They are not usually shared in public, since people may misunderstand them or misuse them.

That knowledge is revealed only to those who join them and gain the trust of the teachers or their trusted inner circle. Many secrets of Hinduism are revealed to the practitioners only after they achieve progress on the path and qualify for it. For example, in the past the knowledge of the Upanishads was taught in secrecy to trusted disciples, after they were thoroughly vetted.

The same was the case with many other branches of knowledge in Hinduism. Dissemination of information depended purely at the discretion of a few people who possessed it. Even now the knowledge of Hinduism is not fully documented. Many old texts are yet to be fully translated and their authenticity yet to be established. The knowledge of Hinduism is thus distributed, with no central authority controlling its flow. Therefore, considerable, dedicated effort is required to gain mastery of its knowledge and wisdom.",1605760785.0

I've spoken to my friends whom are heathens that deal with similar issues with far right people using the religion for their own racist/xenophobic means.
I personally believe that many religions need to transform the religion and it's community from within to drive out such aspects in the community, instead of external methods to change a religion.

religion,Why is occultism considered anti-religious when it is a religion?,"Over the past few years I've tangled with occultists and the occult and it just seems like another religion. For example, Wicca has much of the same symbolism as Christianity, such as a communion of 'cakes and ale', and the goddess being the mother of the god. The Goetia (demon summoning) are just a group of Babylonian gods, like Ishtar, trapped by King Solomon in a jar.

Why is it considered anti religious when it seems for all intensive purposes to be a religion. One ritual used by occultists is the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. This ritual begins with the sign of the cross. However people think that if they do it, it's satanism and edgy. Meanwhile I just feel Alistair Crowley trolled edgelords into making the sign of the cross.

It seems that this division is part of mainstream American culture that is linked to rock music. Rock / metal music is about going against society in every way.  Social cultures that evolved after rock music started are that way as well for example the iconoclasm of the SJW movement, destruction of statues being similar to religious movements, the strong anti religious attitudes within the LGBT movement even though gay men were traditionally found in sacred music, and anti religious mindsets in communism, fascism and libertarianism.

In older American culture I think occultists called themselves doctor and reverend like you can still find folk healers called Reverend Snake, especially in my city. Many occultists in other countries are ordained, Hindu and Buddhist monks, Imams and Catholic priests. Meanwhile here it's the opposite and people lump it together with atheism.

religion,Baptized wrong?,"I was baptized when I was 17 years old by a Baptist preacher who baptized me in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost I was really happy after that baptism and felt like I had given my life to Jesus though I knew I was a perfect I still struggled with sin I was hoping that Jesus could help me overcome those sins. Fast forward 10 years I've been a different churches and can't seem to find the right one that I feel like I fit into. One church I went to the people there were giving me death threats and being racist towards me and my son, other churches that just felt like I didn't agree with everything they were teaching so now I don't go to church but I still believe in Jesus. Before this year I started going to Pentecostal Church and they told me that I wasn't baptized right therefore I wasn't saved. They said the being baptized in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost was wrong and that no disciple in the Bible baptized that way because they knew that Jesus's name was what I was supposed to be baptized in. For any pastors or preachers or religious people is it wrong to be baptized in the name of the Father son and the Holy Spirit? I know several people that have been baptized that way and if it is wrong then millions of people who believe that they are saved won't be. I'm really wrestling with it because I feel like I was baptized correctly but a lot of pastors keep telling me including my husband and other church members that I have not been correctly baptized and need to get rebaptized. It kind of made sense when they showed me how to disciple baptized they did it in Jesus's name. Are there any scriptures that show it's okay to be baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Spirit?

This whole situation is taking a toll on my mental health. I think about death and dying a lot and I've had panic attacks/depressive episodes that stem from thinking about my mortality and soul and shit. I feel like I can't live life.

religion,The logic behind my atheism.,"Id like to gain deeper insight into the reasoning and logic behind others religious beliefs, these are just some of the reasons that I am atheist and I want to have a non inflammatory debate on the topic if possible. Below is a serious of arguments I have created which arent intended to be offensive in any way they are just my opinions.

The only reason that the idea of a ""higher power"" originated in the first place was to provide an explanation to the unexplainable back when we didn't know better, and also as a way to control the uneducated, illiterate masses. Back in the time when the Vatican still had immense power they would use their position to control people and stifle scientific discovery, examples include many scientists who were eventually proven right, some of these include Copernicus, Bruno, Kepler Galileo and Newton. These great minds were persecuted by the church and clergy of the time, their discoveries buried and some even murdered, such as Giordano Bruno, a great man far ahead of his time who believed that the universe was infinite, and contained many worlds just like ours, we know this today to be undebatable. For his discovery he shunned, exiled, ridiculed and eventually was burned at the stake by the Roman Inquisition. Similar fates befell many other unfortunate men.

As mentioned prior I believe religion was originally created to explain the unexplainable.

Why is the sky blue? God must have designed it that way. Why do we die? It's gods will. Why did our entire village experience a drought? We must have angered god. It seems incredible to me that people still believe in something so ancient and in my opinion, obviously not true, even more so in todays world where we have the privilege to be provided with factual scientific explanations for many natural phenomena that may not have been understood thousands of years ago.

The philosophical idea of a an ""all powerful"" creator contradicts itself right at the first step, if god is all powerful then how did he come to exist? How did he create billions and billions of stars, planets, and galaxies in just 7 days. That makes zero sense. To me it just seems logically impossible that a god could exist, let alone heaven or hell. Where are they? Why can we go to space, look back down on Earth and clearly see nothing of the sort?

During the Renaissance Era throughout Europe, science progressed to a point where it began to contradict religion, while I see many religious people who believe in science I don't understand how these two can coexist, we have hard proof of science, but not of religion. The bible says the earth is only a few thousand years old, yet through radioactive decay dating we have determined unequivocally that the Earth is in fact 4.5 billion years old. If god created the universe in 7 days, how could he possibly (in a way that agrees with science) have created billions upon billions of planets, solar systems, and galaxies in such a short time. This seems illogical to me and frankly, impossible.

We know psychic powers don't exist, there have been people offering large amounts of money for proof of its existence for decades yet unsurprisingly, nobody has ever been able to claim the prize. There's never been hard proof of demons, angels, or any other biblical entities, cases of demonic possession can be explained by mental illness combined with strong religious beliefs which cause the manifestation of ""demonic"" like symptoms (speaking in tongues, pain, etcetera.) The placebo effect is VERY powerful. Examples of this include ancient Shaman priests, who experienced ""visions"" and were said to be able to speak with god, many historians now believe that these shamans actually suffered from Schizophrenia and were only hearing their own voices.

This is my opinion. What do yall think? It'd be great to hear some rebuttals from religious people to some of my points.

Edit: Could have worded most of this stuff better I kind of rushed the write up.""The only reason that the idea of a ""higher power"" originated""Obviously this is incorrect and should have thought a bit harder about how to format my thoughts

Edit 2: I figured I should post my own reason for my beliefs, so I've copied it from a reply I made to a comment.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My path to understanding began when I first took LSD, it is such an inexplicable drug, It's so much more than pretty colors and shapes. It makes me feel a connection to the universe, like I'm a small part of the awe inspiring immensity of the cosmos.Before I took LSD I was agnostic, I didn't really have any beliefs, I generally believed the scientific explanation of events but I was indifferent, I didn't really care.

When I first I decided to do the drug, originally I just wanted to see what its like, and to experience the colors I had heard so much about, I never expected to begin a journey of understanding. The first time I took LSD I took 250ug, and this was just the start, I spent my first hours looking around, trying to understand and comprehend how I could possibly be seeing things that weren't real, up to this point I had never experienced a different reality and it was something that I found incredible.Then the peak hit.I was lying in my bed looking through a beautiful kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, I actually started crying, which I continued to do for about an hour, and I'm not the type of person to cry, before that moment I probably hadn't done so in years. I began to feel a tightness in my chest, and I experienced the sudden urge to learn. I ***needed*** knowledge, I needed to understand. Why I got this urge I will never know, but I'm so glad I did, I began by watching the entirety of Cosmos, and I felt an inexplicable connection to the universe.

Over a period of about 2 months I would take LSD every weekend and just learn, I would take increasingly higher doses, I was a sponge for science, I wanted so badly to know why we exist, why the universe exists. Over this period of time I learnt a lot about science, it got to the point where while on LSD I would go outside into the back yard and just stare at plants, and I would then close my eyes and in my mind I had the ability to see inside the plant, how it functioned, how it used quantum mechanics to transport energy through the cell, how every plant on earth was interconnected through the mycorrhizal network, just as I felt interconnected to them. This feeling I will never be able to describe to anyone. Ever. It was at this point that my shift from agnostic to atheist began.

As my journey progressed I continued to feel this connection, until one day I stumbled across videos about religion, I watched a lot of them, trying to understand, but it felt empty. It felt nothing like the beauty of science, of life, of the sheer immensity and vastness of space. It felt to me like a cop out, like accepting that we don't know. There is a reason we exist, there is an origin of the universe and to try assign this to a higher power felt like, for lack of a better term, blasphemy. It is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.

I remember vividly, lying down in my backyard at night, surrounded by nature, tripping on nearly 1000ug, I experienced ego death.   
*""From a philosophical point of view, ego death can be described as a temporary transformation of the psyche—shifting from self-centered to completely unbiased. This could foster a novel perspective, unclouded by the lens of duality that the ego casts over our mundane consciousness. You are fully “in the moment” and able to see things from a macroscopic, more objective perspective. You are no longer an individual isolated from life as it takes place around you, but rather feel interconnected with the universe and all its inhabitants, experiencing intense feelings of love, euphoria, and unity while the self is temporarily forgotten. "" -*[*https://doubleblindmag.com/ego-death/*](https://doubleblindmag.com/ego-death/) 

I closed my eyes and left my body. I was watching myself, lying there, experiencing the beauty of science, its unbreakable laws, its finality, its complexity. I then left Earth, and explored the cosmos, I was now surrounded by the science I had spent the previous months learning about. I saw the laws of science in action, gravity, time, I saw black holes, other planets. I felt terrified, but also like I seemingly belonged, I felt a part of this universe. By the time I opened my eyes, 4 hours had passed but it seemed like an eternity. I felt like a completely different person, and I haven't been the same since.

I remember my only thought during the entire experience being"" How could one being, possibly create all this beauty, there must be a better explanation.""

To quote a truly great man, Carl Sagan,

*Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. We're made of star stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself, and Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.*

I know the LSD was just a chemical reaction in my brain, and that all feelings, anger, sadness, hate, love, are all fake. Designed by evolution to bend us to its will, to continue the cycle of life. It seemed so real though, to the point where I feel like I know for certain. Our existence in this world is sheer luck, and the fact that I grew up in a time where I was able to experience something like this makes me eternally grateful. We are not alone in this universe, there are other beings, on other planets, who were just as lucky as us, whether I will have the privilege of experiencing meeting them in our lifetime is out of my hands, unfortunately I don't have the scientific or mathematic ability to help, which truly saddens me. I will have to leave this to the geniuses of our time to solve on my behalf.

These experiences were something I will never fully be able to understand, but to me, personally, I am content in my knowledge, that we have been given the opportunity to take a fleeting glimpse at the beauty of our existence, and I hope that we will do everything in our power as a species to try comprehend it by utilizing the scientific method, and questioning ***EVERYTHING.*** No piece of knowledge is insignificant in this puzzle.

Which is why I'm now here, trying to understand other peoples perspectives and experiences that led them to different conclusions than I.",1605497747.0

religion,"Feeling more skeptical about religious figures and institutions, but not necessarily religion itself","I was born and raised Muslim, and while I still identify with it, I am not super religious, more so spiritually than practicing. While I do believe in Islam's values, I am very skeptical of religious figures and mosques. An organization near me a few years ago wanted donations of at least $1,000 so they could build a mosque, but instead of telling people hey we are building a mosque please help out from the goodness of your heart, they were saying that if you pay $1,000 you get one brick in heaven, and the more bricks you get can build a house for you in heaven. This just sounded like a scam--I don't know if the Quran says that if you pay $1,000 to build a mosque you get a brick in heaven.  But they did build a mosque, and I believe that they said you will get a brick in heaven for the donor's selfish benefit as a way to get people to donate, bc people were not donating to build a mosque, but for their own house in heaven.

Maybe this is just me not reading the Quran enough, but nowadays people are so tied to being Muslim in a very strict, nuanced way that people forget that Islam generally outlines a way of life. For example, my aunt says that I have to wear socks in front of men, or else I go to hell, and she firmly believes that. Or if I sleep a certain way I won't get into heaven, etc, just very little things that probably don't make or break going into heaven or hell but people get worked up by this. Like to each his own, people can practice religion how they want to , but my family always dictates specifically how I should practice Islam, when I don't do much besides the 5 pillars (I don't even wear a hijab).

I read about religious figures being accused of harassment, rape, assault, or committing fraud. I know that there are good religious preachers out there, but I have trust issues and some people give their entire heart and soul to a preacher instead of their own spiritual wellbeing. My mother is OBSESSED with a preacher, Nouman Ali Khan where she has him playing on full volume 24/7 on tv screens, computer screens, tablets all at once and has donated thousands of dollars to his organization. She is saying she is doing it to help others and help the ""spread or preaching"" of Islam and she will get into heaven, but tbh I don't know exactly what and how religious institutions divide the money. We put all this trust into an institution, just for some kind of fraud or scandal to come out later.

Nouman Ali Khan has been accused of harassment of women before, and paying women to keep their mouths shut (prob from donations). I don't know how true this is or not, but I believe it to an extent if multiple women have spoken up about this (as a rape survivor myself). My mom says that if we were not victims we should not believe it happened, but that's not true. The same could be said about religion, she wasn't there thousands of years ago when religions formed so why should she believe it, but we still do and practice it. I believe that donations to a reputable institution is okay, but that money should be placed more towards charity organizations such as ""zakat"", rather than large organizations like Khan's to just ""spread Islam"" where we don't know what the money is used for, or donate to the local mosque. Its like my mom worships the modern day religious figures than God.

religion,I'm struggling to keep my Catholic friends because they think I am going to Hell.,"So let me start off by saying I went to Catholic School for 12 years. I was very confused about my faith during this time and I come from an extremely religious family. During high school, I decided I was agnostic. This was not an easy decision and I did not just make it out of the blue. Fast forward to now where I am a junior in college and I have a pretty solid friend group. Right now however, I feel like I might lose almost all my friends because of what they told me they believe. My roommates and I got into a discussion about religion somehow and they were talking about how life has no purpose without religion which is when I stepped in. I asked if they thought I was going to Hell which they all said yes. They believe that anybody who accepts God or Jesus into their lives deserves Heaven no matter who they are. So I countered by asking what if someone is a rapist/murderer/terrorist etc, they still deserve to go to Heaven if they accept Jesus to which they said yes. So pretty much my friends think I am the lowest of the low, deserving to burn eternally for being a nonbeliever. They think I deserve worse than some of the worst people to ever live and I don't know how to cope with it. I know it shouldn't matter because I don't believe in Hell but I come from a religious background so I know what it means to them when they say that. Should I drop them? If I were them, I dont think I could be friends with somebody who I know is doomed to eternal torture. I'm not going to convert so I am considered a lost cause correct. I don't really want to associate myself with people who think I am a horrible person. I cannot get behind this logic, I am sorry if I offended anyone on here at the end of the day these are just my opinions.

religion,Bridging the Divide: How definitions are fraught and a possible solution to human separation,"“Who controls the present controls the past”. In his novel, *1984* George Orwell demonstrates how **language can be used to suppress the freedom of individuals**. In this important story the totalitarian institution known simply as “The Party”, systematically invents a new language called “Newspeak”. This language is a method of narrowing the definition of words. It  strips away the ambiguity and nuance of thought. Under the shadow of “Newspeak” a statement such as “all men are equal” is absurd because the word “equal” has a modified meaning. This statement may as well mean “all men are the same height”. In *1984* “The Party” has succeeded in changing the thoughts that arise in the mind when the word “equal” is encountered. This effect is sustained even when individuals encounter the modified word in the past and the future. One lesson to draw from this powerful novel is that **manipulation of language is a serious offence to freedom of thought**. This brilliant demonstration the malleability of the past highlighted for me the problems I’ve had discussing the topics I’m exploring for this book project. As an example let’s take the word “religion”. 

It is said that in order to write a book, the writer should know 10 to 20 times more than what he commits to the page. I take this advice to heart and as a result find myself researching things that, at first glance, appear not exactly related to the topic of music. Such as the history of religion. I did a deeper than average research into religion and found perspectives that valorizes it. In the process I discovered that my mind’s quick search definition of the word “religion” changed over time. **Any given word can contain an infinite amount of meaning**. So to communicate successfully we have to use shortcut definitions. Of course, this is wise in most cases. But when it comes to discussing something as fraught as religion it is necessary to keep an eye on our definitions and how those definitions change our view of the world. Why is this wise? Because definition conflicts can result in separating us from each other and undermining our freedom of thought. I may live in a reality where the word religion means more than “bad thing” but others may live in a reality where “religion” means “bad thing” because they were injured by religious institutions. My challenge to us all is to find ways to bridge this separation. **I propose a curious and exploratory approach to definitions** as a method of connecting to each other. I want to do my part by discussing a personal experience with religion that an opposing viewpoint might understand.

I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness and had child sex abuse incidents occur in my family at the hands of religious authority figures. When this all came to light many years later, the criminal had already been promoted to missionary work in another country. **My parents encouraged their children to forgive this abuser**. What was their rationale for this? They thought that God forgave the abuser, so we should too. I was so profoundly mind controlled by this religious organization that I sided with this viewpoint for many years. I am telling you this story so that you understand that I know firsthand the ravages of religion and that **my definition of religion acknowledges this hurt** and even shares it.

To be perfectly clear I am not invoking favorable or unfavorable definitions of religion. I am trying to underline a fundamental human phenomenon that ends up being religion as we know it. I think that** a religious urge exists so fundamentally within the human creature** that its manifestation is inevitable. I ask a favor from those hostile to religion: please consider the possibility that the religious imagination can manifest itself in non-destructive ways and that for some even, it can be a tool for healing. If you can allow yourself to include such a possibility in your definitions it **may contribute to reduce the sense of separation plaguing us all.**",1605293644.0

religion,What do we mean by 'Religion'?,"The term ""religion"" is so often used that no theological discussion goes without using it. But have you ever wondered what this term ""religion"" actually means? Well, it could mean many things. And that's why it's not a really a  good idea to use the term as a blanket reference. That would construe as a Strawman. 

Prof. Tim Crane, head of the Central European University (CEU) citing Nietzsche, the German philosopher, states with regards to the term:
“Friedrich Nietzsche said that only that which has no history can be defined, and if he is right (which he surely is), then religion cannot be defined. For religion is so wrapped up with human history and prehistory that we should not hope for a sharp definition of the kind that we get in mathematics..”[1] 

Eric Reitan, Philosopher of Religion at Oklahoma State University, succinctly describes the issue with the term religion, he states:
“The fact is, we use the term “religion” in a variety of ways. And this fact makes it difficult to talk precisely about religion, let alone attack it with valid objections. Whenever usage is so varied, there is a real danger that one will fall prey to what philosophers call equivocation — that is, the fallacy of using the same term in different senses in the course of a single argument or discussion, without noticing the shift. […] Is religion a comprehensive and unsurpassable account of everything that matters to a person? If so, the naturalism secular humanists would qualify as their religion. Or is religion a private matter of how the individual relates subjectively to what is taken to be the fundamental reality? If so, the physicist’s awe and wonder at the vast beauty of the cosmos would be a religion. Or is religion a social construct, its metaphysical pronouncements (if any) an incidental by-product of its goal of creating loyalty, obedience, and cohesion among society’s members? If so, Marxist ideology would have been the religion of the former Soviet Union. Or is religion an attempt, through metaphors and ritual practices, to bring our lives into alignment with an inexpressible transcendent reality? If so, then most world religions would paradoxically be true religions even as they reject the accuracy of Hick’s account (since thy don’t typically take themselves to be engaged in merely metaphorical discourse). The point, of course, is that “religion” is used in all these ways and more.”[2]

religion,The Main Sources of the Knowledge of Hinduism,"The ritual and spiritual knowledge of Hinduism, its philosophy, beliefs and practices are derived principally derived from three sources namely, the teacher traditions, ascetic teachings, sectarian works, and literary sources. Hinduism continues to derive its doctrinal knowledge even today.

For a longtime the teacher traditions or guru traditions played a significant role in promoting and preserving the knowledge of Hinduism. They brought to light the secrets hidden in the principal texts of Hinduism, adding their own revelations and interpretations wherever necessary. Their knowledge was preserved through successive generations by the tradition of gurukrama or succession program in which each master chose his successor through a careful selection process by following a set of rules and precedence’s.

Apart from teacher traditions, India also witnessed the rise of numerous ascetic movements who drew their inspiration from the sacred texts of Hinduism and in turn enriched its theology and spiritual philosophy. Sometimes, the distinction between the guru traditions and the ascetic traditions was rather blurred since they both followed the same principles to transmit knowledge or ensure their continuity. Nevertheless, they contributed to our understanding of Hinduism.

Our knowledge of Hinduism also comes from Hindu sects namely Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Tantra. All these sects might have originated independently, but in course of time they became integrated into the Vedic tradition. Yet, each of the sects has distinct identity and its set of beliefs and practices and literary resources. They also contribute richly to the sacred knowledge of Hinduism.",1604896407.0

Let me mention that as soon as I saw this woman and heard her speak I could instantly tell something was off and so could the people I was with, it seemed like she was possibly on drugs or she was mentally ill. As soon as we walked up to the creek she came up to us from where she was in the distance and began ranting on about the biblical end times and rapture which correlates with Christianity. She then started comparing herself to Noah in Noah’s ark and acted as if she was him. She was saying something about being born into the dirt and saying that God gave her all the knowledge and speaks through her. I kid you not this woman spoke to us for about 15 minutes giving little time for us to respond to anything she was saying before I finally said we needed to get going before the sun set. What I am asking is for those of you well-versed on different types of religion, what could this be? It looks like some kind of ritual to me. The dirt under the altar looks slightly different.

religion,Not sure what to believe anymore,"I am a first time poster on here, so please let me apologise beforehand if this is in the wrong topic. I’m going to share with you all a revelation that has knocked me sideways. I have no explanation to what has happened and was wondering if anyone can explain or have had something similar happen to them. To really understand, I am going to have to tell you right from the beginning when I was a young child. 

I am currently a 47 year old man. When I was a child my mother and grandmother would go to church every Sunday and I would be packed off to Sunday school next door and learn about God and Jesus. I totally believed in this and all the wonderful miracles amazed me and I was in total comfort knowing that there was someone watching over us. Fast forward to when I was 13 years old, this year 1986 was such a traumatic time in my life, this year was a turning point in my life, this is the year I lost my faith. 

My grandad had been diagnosed with stomach cancer and while my parents were on holiday in another country I was staying with my grandparents. One night I had woken up early because I needed to go to the toilet and as I opened my bedroom door I had seen my grandad coming out of the toilet on all fours struggling to get back to his bedroom. Instead of helping him I quickly closed my door and started praying at the corner of my bed to god to make my grandad better. I didn’t get back to sleep that night, I prayed and prayed for hours that night, just like I was told to do and that God would eventually hear me. Sadly my grandad passed away the following morning. I completely blamed myself for his passing because I believed I didn’t pray hard enough for God to hear me. This is when I completely lost faith and decided to look at alternatives. 

Now this next bit is where something strange happened. That same year in December I am school and at every lunch break I would go to a park that was adjacent to my school with my friends and we would eat, play and hang out together. In this park is a small stream and there was a swing with a car tire for you to sit in, this swing was very big with a long rope connected to a huge tree, we often went on this swing to see if we could dodge the many trees that were in its path. Thinking about it now,  how stupid we were but we were fearless at that age. I decided that day to go on the swing not knowing that it would be my last time. I pulled the swing towards me from the middle of the stream and ran up the slight bank so I could go faster and get a good height. I jump on the swing very quickly and in doing so the swing has turned and I am moving extremely fast with my back moving forward, I can’t see what is in front of me and I’m desperately trying to turn round. 

I don’t really know at what point I made contact with the tree because still to this day I can’t remember,  but what I can remember is this. I suddenly see my smiling parents in a field with flowers up to their knees, holding hands and with their other hands they are beckoning me to come towards them. I start to run towards them but I immediately stop because I hear a voice behind me, a voice so pure but a voice I don’t know or even understand. I turn and see a woman with long blonde hair and wearing a long white summer dress, she also is beckoning me with arms stretched open wide. I start to walk towards this woman, she is talking but I understand nothing, I am so fascinated with her hair and smile, I turn to look at my parents, they are still there but have stopped calling me. As I get closer to this woman she starts  to outstretch one hand asking me to take it, I put my hand in hers and then suddenly I wake up, I see two medical people attending me with my friends to one side and a concerned teacher the other. I had been unconscious for 30 minutes and was taken to hospital where I was released the following day. 

Now, this should be the end of story but it is far from it. Having no faith in God for many years and in fact never stepping into a church unless I had to, I met a Spanish woman and moved to Spain with our daughter and son on the way. Unfortunately after 12 years together we decided to end the relationship. At this time I am deeply depressed and not knowing what to do I had an urge to go inside a church. The moment I stepped through the door I suddenly felt warmth and a sense of belonging, but quickly I dispersed this feeling as my emotions playing tricks on me. 

Now, this is where most of you won’t believe me and I can’t blame you as I find it hard myself. After a few years of being single I met the most wonderful partner, she is so kind, beautiful and amazing. We have been together for about a year and half, during this time I have asked her many times if we have met before, but she is adamant that we haven’t, but I have had the sensation that we have. Last week as we are taking our weekly walk along the beach we start to reminisce about our childhood and what things we can remember, I suddenly stop walking and can’t hardly catch my breath, the woman all those years ago when I touched her hand is standing right next to me. I know that many of you will disbelieve this but I’m 100% sure. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",1604850910.0
religion,The Persian And Greek Origins of “Hindu” and “Indos”,"Interestingly the words ""Hindu"" and Hinduism are not Sanskrit words. No Hindu ever coined them. The Hindus were even unaware of such a terminology for a very long time. While the foreign scholars of Greece and Persia made an occasional glance out of curiosity towards the lands that existed beyond the Indus, the native Indians were busy in their own little world oblivious of the fact that they had very little in common with the outside world except perhaps in matters of commerce, governance and few other things.

The earliest reference to the word ""Hindu"" can be found in the Avestha, the sacred book of the Zoroastrians. The word ""Hindu 'ush"" was also found at least in two inscriptions of king Darius (early sixth Century B.C.), whose empire said to have extended up to the borders of the River Sindhu.

Subsequently the word was picked up by Herodotus and later by the Armenians. For several centuries, the word was used to denote the people of the subcontinent, not people of a particular faith. From the eighth century A.D. onwards when the Muslims began to settle down in the Indus region they started using the word ""Hindus"" to distinguish the natives from the Muslims.",1604814457.0
religion,Need help explaining something.,"Let me start by saying that I have never been religious. My parents brought me and my siblings to church maybe once or twice but we never really connected to it. Fast forward 20 or so years to now when just yesterday I had the most profound yet confusing experience of my life. 

At about 10am I left the house. I work an odd schedule and it was my day off. The rain beat down all night and drenched my small neighborhood. The down pour stopped around 9 and when I walked out the door the smell of the wet landscape gave me a rush like no other. This when things start to get weird. The rush didn’t stop. All of the sudden my body was pulsing with what I can only describe as pure elation. It lasted for awhile though it felt time stood still. Then I looked down at my feet while I was walking. The ground all around me was soaking wet but where I stood it was dry. With every step I took the pavement would dry up just a few feet in front of me as if it were guiding me somewhere. Unfortunately before I made it to any destination there was a crash of thunder and a sudden down pour. Almost instantly it wet the ground that was once dry beneath my feet and I just stood there dumbfounded. The rush of elation was also snapped from my body in that moment. 

I would like to figure out if anyone else has had a similar experience.

People like God or whatever the equivalent is in said religion. People like to draw lines between what they deem ""good"" or ""bad."" No problem in doing this.

I dont have a traditional belief in faith, but I have faith and stuff within my life that might be described as ""alternative."" Point is...I wish they'd put a piece of media in there that says something along the lines of being supportive to people with different beliefs and or just saying that ""its okay to believe in whatever you want, but we are still all humans and support each others beliefs."" 

I think if this were the case and people were to implement introducing their beliefs to others then people would see it as more respectable. Throw some "" we dont care what you believe as long as you're making good decisions and taking care of business within your community"" and people might answer the door more. They might start conversations more. After all a set of beliefs comes with morals and those become moral topics...and the truth is there are many religions in the world. Maybe it's easier to find common ground with someone rather than try to convert their whole being.

Also, I dont see this happening in rich neighborhoods. Mostly poor neighborhoods. More of a savior complex where you take your kid or relative fresh out of rehab and set them out to tell people the ""correct"" version of what to believe...when there is no perfect religion...but the perfection lies within the imperfection of what makes up conscious humans. What makes our thoughts critical. Our acceptance of others, rather that judgement or conversion. 

You cant tell anyone anything if they dont want to hear it. The best way to spread the word might be to find a forum where people are accepted without the need to be told whichever belief is better...nothing good ever came out of conflict...

religion,The Ten Main Duties (Dharmas) in Hinduism,"1. Duty towards self
          - Duties towards Self can be divided into duties towards the body, the mind, and the soul respectively, which lead to health, strength, mental clarity, purity (sattva), and spiritual transformation. Their purpose is to improve and maintain one's own physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing. The Bhagavadgita says,"" One should uplift oneself by oneself; and one should not debase oneself because surely the Self is one's own friend and one's own enemy."" It means you are your own best friend when you are on the path of righteousness, and your worst enemy when you indulge in evil actions. Therefore, one should not indulge in any actions that would lead to one's moral and spiritual downfall into darker and demonic hells. Although householders lead worldly lives, eventually they have to work for their liberation.

2. Duty towards gods
          - The gods (devas) exist in the body as organs and in the universe as the lords of their respective spheres. Since they are selfless and do not make food for themselves, human beings are obliged by duty to perform rituals and sacrifices and make them offerings of food. As you are aware, if you do not feed  your body, your senses become numb and weak. You also know that if you feed the evil behavior in you, the gods and the sattva in you grow weaker while the demonic tendencies and impurities in you grow stronger. It is therefore important that you nourish yourself and gods with good thoughts and good food through your conduct as well as sacrifices.

3. Duty towards ancestors
          - Your ancestors are responsible for your birth. They contribute to your gene pool. Hence, you owe them a debt of gratitude. According to the Vedas, upon departing from here, the souls live in the ancestral world until their karmas are exhausted. By doing good deeds, living virtuously, performing, rituals and making them offerings of food, their descendants can prolong their stay and grant them better lives in their next birth. This is pitryajna, sacrifice to the ancestors, which the Vedas declare as the duty of human beings towards their ancestors. If your ancestors are happy, they will also bless you and help you attain peace and prosperity upon earth. By serving them, you will replay the karmic debt you owe to them.

4. Duty towards progeny
          - Hindus are expected to work for the welfare of their progeny from the time of their conception. Until they renounce their worldly lives and take up renunciation, parents have an obligation to perform all the sacraments for the children, educate them either personally or with the help of learned teachers, teach them their duties and responsibilities, inculcate in them good values, and help them become virtuous individuals. At the time of death, they are also expected to pass on their good name, qualities, strengths and abilities to their children through prayers and rituals. Since parents can be born in the same families as the children or grandchildren of their own children, such duties become even more important to preserve the family line, name, status and reputation.

5. Duty towards fellow human beings
          - As a Hindu, you are not expected to live selfishly for yourself or your family only because you are but a representative of God upon earth. Your life, identity, power, abilities, strengths, riches, and enjoyment come from Him. Therefore, in Hinduism charity (dana) is one of the highest virtues. In fact, it was the only virtue, which Brahma specifically taught to humans in the beginning of creation for their peace and happiness. In Hinduism, service to humanity is considered service to God. Hence, Hindus have an obligation to help the poor and the needy, the weak and the disabled, the beggars, the mendicants, monks and ascetics who do not cook food for themselves. They are also expected to serve the guests who visit their homes, and educate those who approach them with a request to teach them knowledge.

6. Duty towards other living beings
          - Since all beings possess souls and since they are manifestations of Brahman only, Hindus have an obligation to show compassion towards all living beings, practice nonviolence, and avoid harming and hurting anyone, except in self-defense. They are also expected to nourish them within their means and help them survive and flourish. Hinduism is the only religion where animals are not only treated with consideration but also traditionally worshipped. Many deities have either animal forms and features, or use animals as their vehicles. Animals have also duties in creation and their duty is to serve humans in different capacities. As the Vedas say, just as the humans are to gods, the cattle are to humans.

7. Duty towards society
          - Hindus have an obligation to uphold the order and regularity (rta) of society. They are not expected to destroy or disturb the institutions of family, caste, community, or tradition, whose source is in heaven since they are established by God to prevent chaos and confusion in the mortal world. Followers of God are also expected not to spread confusion by teaching perverted knowledge, beliefs, and philosophies that can unsettle human minds and lead to their moral and spiritual downfall. The scriptures declare that whenever society is in decline and evil is on the rise, due to our failure to contain it, God himself manifests upon earth to restore Dharma or He may manifest His aspects, emanations, demigods and associate powers for the same purpose. During normal times we are expected to do it in our individual capacity as the upholders of Dharma.

8. Moral duties
          - In Hinduism, every human being has an obligation to practice virtue and uphold the Divine Law. They have to cultivate purity (sattva), and discernment (buddhi) and follow the injunctions and guidelines prescribed in the scriptures. Some important moral duties are the study and recitation of scriptures, prayers, worship, rituals, sacrifices, devotion, self-restraint, purity, moral discipline, discernment, resolve, good works, and the practice of virtues such as nonviolence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy before marriage, and non-covetousness. Other duties include respecting the elders, parents and teachers, taking care of old and aged members of the family, helping children to grow up, and avoiding the cardinal sins namely lust, anger, pride, envy, and delusion.

9. Professional duties
          - Hindus have are obliged to perform certain duties and responsibilities that come with power, position, caste and authority. For example each caste and caste related profession entails upon its members certain duties and obligations. In today's world most professions are not birth related. However, it is still important that they are performed according to the established practice. For example, those who are in leadership positions have to act fairly and impartially without falling for temptations and selfishness. Those who become spiritual teachers, or take up priesthood functions have to live virtuously and spread the knowledge of the Dharma. Those who become the warriors of Hinduism have to defend their faith, their land, and the people who practice it. Traders and merchants have to practice their professions without lying, cheating, and deceiving. Finally, those who take up manual labor should follow the rules that apply to them and do their part in serving others, without expecting society to take care of them, or support them with freebies.

10. Duties towards other faiths
          - It is the duty of a Hindu to practice his faith, but not to unsettle the minds of those who do not practice it. They are expected to show restraint and friendliness in dealing with people of other faiths, and live in harmony with them. Hinduism clearly affirms that the paths to God are many and all paths lead to Him only. Hence, fanaticism and intolerance are completely ruled out. However, amity does not mean submission to other faiths or practicing them. As a Hindu you not only have a right to choose what you believe in, but also have an obligation to defend your faith if necessary. In this regard, the gods of Hinduism are the best example. They are the most benign and compassionate beings, and yet each is a warrior who will not hesitate to fight the demons if the situation demands.",1606105701.0

In Exodus, it is stated multiple times that God ""hardens Pharaoh's heart""  so he will not free the Israelites.  Because of this, a whole nation suffers through death and disease because the God of their slaves cursed them, and a whole nation is kept enslaved for a longer period of time.  What is heart hardening?  At best it sounds like swaying emotion, and at best mind control.  If God is interfering with the decision making process of even one human on that level, can it truly be said we have free will?  How often does God deliberately change the decisions of humans?

&amp;#x200B;

I do not consider the KJV to be holier than other Bible versions. I am using the KJV in this post because it is, as far as I know, the only Bible in which ""helel"" (morning star) is translated as ""Lucifer"" in Isaiah 14, which I consider to be important for this post.

I do not believe that connecting the KJV's Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 to Satan's Fall is an error of translation or interpretation. The reasons why are these parallels to his fall in the Apocrypha.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start with the **Isaiah 14 parallels** (with a bit of **Genesis 3** as well)**.**

**2. Enoch 29,3:**

*And one from out the order of angels, having turned away with the order that was under him, conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to my power.*

**Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, Book 1, 6,7:**

*""But the wicked Satan who continued not in his first estate, nor kept his faith; in whom was no good intent towards Me, and who though I had created him, yet set Me at naught, and sought the Godhead, so that I hurled him down from heaven,--he it is who made the tree appear pleasant in your eyes, until you ate of it, by hearkening to him.*

**Isaiah 14,12-15 (KJV):**

*How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!*

*For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:*

*I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.*

*Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.*

&amp;#x200B;

Then get to the **Ezekiel 28 parallels** (again **Genesis 3**).

**Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, Book 1, 17,2-6:**

*But as they drew near to it, before the western gate, from which Satan came when he deceived Adam and Eve, they found the. serpent that became Satan coming at the gate, and sorrowfully licking the dust, and wriggling on its breast on the ground, by reason of the curse that fell upon it from God.*

*And whereas aforetime the serpent was the most exalted of all beasts, now it was changed and become slippery, and the meanest of them all, and it crept on its breast and went on its belly.*

*And whereas it was the fairest of all beasts, it had been changed, and was become the ugliest of them all. Instead of feeding on the best food, now it turned to eat the dust. Instead of dwelling, as before, in the best places, now it lived in the dust.*

*And, whereas it had been the most beautiful of all beasts, all of which stood dumb at its beauty, it was now abhorred of them.*

*And, again, whereas it dwelt in one beautiful abode, to which all other animals came from elsewhere; and where it drank, they drank also of the same; now, after it had become venomous, by reason of God's curse, all beasts fled from its abode, and would not drink of the water it drank; but fled from it.*

**Ezekiel 28,12-19 (KJV):**

*Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.*

*Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.*

*Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.*

*Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.*

*By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.*

*Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.*

*Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.*

*All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.*

**Genesis 3,14 (KJV):**

*And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:*

Using the social science, hard scientific approach, and studies  of literature and mythology approach to religion, many scholars and academics state archetypes have a dual side. For a Greek pagan example Ares may be the God of War but he is also the God of civil order and police and even prayed to for asking for peace in personal life. As well as the God who is most respectful to women.

Jesus is seen as having not just dual but multiple sides such as the peaceloving human who sacrificed everything for humanity, the ruthless warlike Yahweh, and the Holy Spirit who inspires and directly intervenes. Similar parallels are made about Shiva in Hindu mythology where Shiva has a warlike incarnation, a peaceful human like form, etc.

religion,My husband is suddenly very religious and it’s worrying me (Christianity/Catholicism),"My husband and I are newly married and recently moved from New York (his home town) to Toronto (my home town) together.

Last week, he started watching YouTube videos on the bible, Jesus Christ, and the works. Now he is fully devoted to Jesus, all he does is watch videos and pray. I feel like he’s a different person now.

For background: I am more spiritual or agnostic - as long as you live your life with pure intentions and with love, you’re good. He has been mildly Christian in his younger years, then switched fully to very deep Spirituality for several years, then agnostic, and now says that he is fully devoted to Jesus Christ.

I am worried because it’s an extreme shift and change in his core belief system over only a couple of days. And he keeps talking about fighting the battle against evil in this world.

I agree there is evil in the world, but I’m also very passionately against Christian views on the LGBTQ+ community, abortion, and other things (I’m quite “liberal”). When I express these concerns, he says he’s not concerned with the minor details within our communities - he only cares about the war of evil against humanity, and that he’s here for a bigger purpose.

Am I analyzing the minutiae too much? I think about how Halloween is my absolute favourite... will we not dress up our kids in the future? I love Harry Potter - he told me he can’t watch it with me anymore... it’s little things. But they do matter to me...

Earlier today he pretty much said that it’s wrong of me to worry about or try to question him, because he has a “bigger purpose” that is more important than me or anyone else. That hurt my ego I guess, as I want to feel like I’m important and like our relationship is important. Now this bigger religious purpose is the most important thing and I guess my own self esteem can’t handle this (?)

He doesn’t seem to be concerned about the future of our relationship, and says my beliefs don’t affect him, and he still wants to be together. It makes me insecure that our core beliefs are so different now.

After that long rant... Any advice?

religion,Abrahamic Religions general discussion.,"Looking back to the start of the Abrahamic religions through the eyes of the Jewish (ignoring that it is essentially a rewriting of the sumanrian religion). Apparently before the Jewish began worshiping Yahweh, Yahweh himself asked many other people to worship him as god but they had refused until he came across the Jewish people. The Jews agreed to worship him then and only then did they become the chosen people. It is also recorded that some Jewish people worshiped Molek, especially during the 40 years in the desert. 

Now, I want to be clear, this is no way an attack on the Abrahamic Religions, i just find it odd that Yahweh points out that no other gods should be worshiped, admitting their existence. I believe it is far more likely that these gods were in fact flesh and blood people, advanced as they were to make their powers and technology seem like the work of gods. The Mahabharata has some interesting descriptions of battles between deities that involve weapons that would accurately fit some weapons we use today. 

That's not to say that I don't believe in something more than blue men on rocket powered magic carpets shooting rockets at each other.

religion,I can't stand when people use this arguement about god.,"Referring to the God of the Christian bible logically it doesn't make sense to me. I'm all about fellowship and find it great when open minded people come together and share what they believe without passing judgement. I could be wrong and so could you so let's talk about it and not bash each other along the way. 

One of the things I hate the most is when people use God as fire insurance. They will say ""oh well whatever. I believe in god and if I'm wrong I have nothing to lose, but if your wrong you will burn in hell."" 

If you believe in god then that's great for you, but I feel like if god exists then having that mindset is just using it as a loophole for the death you fear. 

Idk. This is all my opinion, but I can honestly say some of the worst people I've ever met are the church going die hard Christian's and it's like they just believe in god for the fire insurance so they don't go to hell. 

Personally I see it like this. God is more like a tyrant and satan rebelled against him. If jesus was real then he's my homie. From what's described he wanted to help people, be there for them, and loved them and I can say that's how I want to be and I would welcome him with open arms. At the same time tho satan doesnt seem like such a bad guy. All he did was rebel against a tyrant. We know nothing of his story and have no basis to call him evil. 

At the end of the day I try my best to love people and help them. I strive to be better today than I was the previous day.  I've made bad decisions just like everyone else. Those decisions were made due to circumstances I was in whether I put myself there or not. I have emotions, I have problems, and I have things I struggle with just like everyone else and when I die if I do happen to stand before a god and he decides I deserve hell then so be it. I stand behind my decisions and ill admit when I was wrong, but I'm not going to use religion as fire insurance and practice it just because of that.

I mean who really enjoys waking up and going to church? It seems like it's just a collection of people that get all dressed up in their nicest clothes and act like they are worshipping a god while they are judging everyone else there and then they go home and commit the same ""sins"" they just got preached to about. Then you have preachers that get caught raping kids and all kind of stuff that makes you really question it. 

And the argument that when something bad happens its satan and when something good happens its god. 

For example. You have a job interview and you pray every night that you will get that job. You go through the interview and you get it. Yay! Why give all the credit to god. It was YOU that did it. Not god. He had no part in it. If you didnt get the job it wasnt satan it was just another person deciding you weren't a good fit. 

This is just my opinion, but it seems like religion is more about population control and fear mongering since we don't know what happens when we die they use that to control people. I'm not an atheist. I guess I'm agnostic. It's not like there's any way if god exists he could expect us to know so how can he give us free will and then punish us for using it?",1606080751.0
religion,Is there a way to go back from atheism ?,"I've tried numerous religions, everytime I thought I was picking up on something spiritual or getting myself to believe, it would end up taking less than 3 to 5 months for me to totally get myself into critical thinking that whatever is happening, cant be real. It's frustrating, I cant see myself to believe in any god since i was 16 and read Carl Sagan the demon hunted world. Now I'm 25, and I've been 3 years searching for god and I'm losing my hope.
For me, religion is a essential way of thinking and it's very important to most people when it comes to mental health, assistance and other things. the energy people have on churchs, temples and other places are beautiful, full of hope and faith. I want this to me, I want to believe again.

religion,Is all Christianity a cult? All religion?,"Recently I've been diving into a YouTube black hole involving the Jehova's Witnesses and their practices.  I grew up a very mundane, benign sect of Protestant under the United Church of Christ.  It never took a hold on me.  When I was a child the weekend was far too exciting for me to pay attention in anything Church related.  I won't get into it, but the Church was always just an annoying chore that I had to endure.  My father made me go through the classes to become Confirmed and accepted in the Church before letting me make my own choice, but I was just never interested.  I had to earn a certain amount of work hours helping the Church to get Confirmed, so it can be said for 18 years of my life there was an attempt to indoctrinate me.  It just never caught a hold.  I just sat quietly through the classes, nodding along and then after the day of my Confirmation, never showed up again.

With such a benign and boring interaction with religion I never really though about it much.  Parents lie to their kids about Santa, the Easter Bunny, and plenty of other things.  It just seemed natural to me to include a certain deity in the list of fantastical things that I've been told exist, but have no proof.  Now I'm in my 30s, watching YouTube about how Jehova's Witnesses are a disturbing high-control religion.  I can't stop seeing resemblances to the church I was brought up in.  Using [Steven Hassan's BITE Model](https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/) he specifically states that *dangerous* mind control involves taking all these methods of control to deliberately promote dependency to an individual *or cause.*  I think the majority of Christian practices fall into this definition.  Some clearly worse than others, but still...

...by definition don't *all* religions fall into this Cult category?  The cause of the seemingly milk-toast United Church of Christ is still to expand its congregation and the worship of God and Jesus.  Any religion's goal is to convert the world to follow the 'true god(s)' and specifically, to follow it how *they* want you to.  If a religion expressed no control over someone then they wouldn't be a religion.  It would just be a bunch of people believing whatever they wanted.  Isn't the very *act* of trying to unify people under a single belief by the use of mind controlling techniques what defines a cult but also is what defines a religion?  Are the two one and the same?  Could you have religion that doesn't use controlling methods?",1591258932.0
religion,My definition of religion,"A religion is a belief system shared between individuals that is not currently supported by evidence. 

So if you strongly believe in string theory that is a religious belief since there isn't evidence for it now.

religion,What is a Christian?,"At a time when he was being hunted down as a criminal, Jesus Christ said that there would come a day when people would claim to be following him just to gain social acceptance. (**Luke 21:8**) Surely this must be one of the most amazing prophecies in the Bible. And it was recorded in print by his followers at a time when they too were being hunted down as criminals. Yet that same prophecy has come true to an extreme throughout much of the Western world.

For many who claim to be following Jesus today, it is unthinkable that anyone would ever question their credentials as 'Christians'. To be labelled as a non-Christian is, to them, like being labelled subhuman. 'Christian' means 'good guy', 'good neighbor', 'decent', and 'respectable'. So how dare anyone suggest that they might not be all these things! At the same time that the status quo lays claim to the title of 'Christian' (and demands that the claim never be questioned), it passes the harshest possible judgment on those who would redefine Christian as a [literal follower](https://twitter.com/alwaysGod37/status/1306508876548718592) of Jesus Christ. We who have chosen to live our lives in accordance with the teachings of Jesus are called a dangerous cult, to be feared and fought by all who consider themselves to be 'Christians' in the socially acceptable way of thinking.

Jesus said of his worst enemies, ""Because you say that you can see, you are really blind."" (**John 9:41**) In other words, it was their own inability to consider that they could be wrong, which made them ineligible for his army to begin with. And it is this same inability for the status quo to question their sincerity that makes them so un-Christian today.

Are you offended when someone questions whether or not you are a Christian? If so, it may be because you are not. A true communist, or truck driver, or Spaniard would hardly take offence by someone seriously questioning whether they are what they say they are. This is because the evidence to support their identity would not come just from their ""claims"", or from ""articles of faith"". It would come from their lives. You don't, for example, argue over whether or not you are a truck driver. You just get out there and drive trucks, and leave the arguments to someone else.

Someone has said, ""If you were accused of being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you."" It is a good way of putting things into perspective. Rather than thinking of Christianity as embodying all those qualities which would make someone popular, we should be prepared to think of it as being something that could make us social outlaws. This is far more in keeping with what Jesus himself taught and lived. At the moment, the ""evidence"" most people look for as proof of being Christian is acceptance by the religious status quo. But anyone who begins to look more closely at what it means to be a Christian in a literal sense, would soon see through the lie which that represents.

While much of the world lives in a whirl of social niceties, where everyone conspires to overlook each other's faults, we dare to make Jesus and his teachings the standard by which to measure true Christian faith. We don't do it to insult or offend. We do it to maintain our sanity. When we say that we cannot find evidence to support your claim to being a Christian, it doesn't mean that we don't like you, that you aren't a very good person, possibly involved deeply in religious activity. It's just that we don't see evidence of your commitment to the teachings of Jesus above all other beliefs.

It's true that, in using the teachings of Jesus as the standard by which to judge who is Christian and who is not, we have come to the conclusion that there are practically no Christians at all left on this planet. Call it exclusivism. Call it judgmental. Call it heretical. But it has been based on an honest examination of the evidence. If a Christian is a follower of Jesus Christ and his teachings, then where is there anyone who is doing that?

We are not talking about people who follow imaginary Jesuses based on their own feelings and desires. We are not talking about people who follow replacement Jesuses in the form of their religious leaders. We are talking about people who read, share, and practice the teachings of the historical Jesus of the Bible... the one who was executed as a criminal... the one who predicted that his name would one day be used to represent all that he opposed.

religion,Why either Islam or Christianity out of all world religions can be true – the real wager:,"**Introduction**
-

Many anti-theists/atheists/agnostics love asking others, ‘why should your religion be believed over other religions?’

So when I got asked this question as a Muslim, I was like, ‘that is actually a very good question, I’m going to find out’.

Thankfully, when I was being asked that question, I was already in the process of studying and critiquing my own religion Islam and other religions. And as a result of that question, all I really had in my head first *(before looking for “the proofs of each religion“)* was the question I needed to know the answer for, which was, ***what are the consequences of not believing in these other religions?*** 

As a result of that question, in my studies, I found an answer. That was **the only two religions which offer its followers the true way of salvation and its stubborn non-followers are to be subject to an eternal punishment of some sorts if they do not follow its religion is as follows: Islam and Christianity.** 

The other smaller religions; I will briefly cover their beliefs in the afterlife with links in the comments below, either believe those who do not believe in their religion have a chance of “salvation” in the afterlife, or are given an infinite or finite amount of chances after our life to make amends whether through being reincarnated into a bat, a rat, a demi-god, or a human as you find taught in these Asian religions which teach you are in some sort of cycle which can eventually be broken. They should be discarded on that basis.

And that to me should be enough for their followers to realise they need to wake up and really judge whether they’re on the right religion for “salvation”.

It bodes the question, **if you have an infinite or finite amount of chances to reach your form of “salvation” as part of these religions, then what risk do you have if you follow another religion be it Islam or Christianity in this life?**

**One, therefore, should theoretically disregard these other religions and need to look between the big two and take seriously the big two which is Islam and Christianity and choose between one of them.**

And considering the Jewish belief in that non-Jews have a place in the World to Come should they follow a court of justice *(much like Sharia)*, reject idolatry *(Jews consider the Trinity idolatry)*, not cursing God, no incest or adultery, no stealing and not eating the flesh of a live animal and so on then **all I found was the best ‘bet’ would really be Islam for the best chance of eternal salvation.** 

Islam and we believe the worlds creator *(Allah)* teaches:

&gt;&gt;&gt; **Now do these people desire to give up the way of Allah's submission *(Islam)* and adopt a different way *(knowing well)*, that all things in heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, submit to Allah, and to Him shall all return? O’ Prophet, say, ""We believe in Allah and in the teachings which have been sent down to us, and also in those teachings sent down to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob and his descendants, and in the guidance that was given by Allah to Moses, Jesus and other Messengers. We do not discriminate against any one of them and we submit and surrender to Him."" And whoso adopts any other than this way of submission *(Islam)*, that way shall not be accepted from him and in the Hereafter, he shall be among the losers.**

&gt;&gt;&gt; *[Qur’an 3:83-85]* *[1]*

Therefore before I looked into the proofs of each religion, I looked at the biggest religions and saw whether it was worth looking at the ones which offer its non-adherents salvation and since Islam holds the biggest chance of reaching the goal of a good afterlife I was already biased in favour of Islam over Christianity but I still looked for the “proofs of Christianity” and it failed to convince me. 

For I worked on looking for evidence to secure my beliefs, where I looked at the flaws of Christianity, be some of it the blatant corruption of its scriptures as explained by Bart D. Ehrman, the pagan origins and clear cut pagan influences of its religious festivals and actions, be it Easter, Christmas, the origins of the Christmas Trees and so on, the depiction of Mary and her child which made her a viable rival to that other popular Roman/Greek/Egyptian hybrid Goddess’ of the time, represented variously as Diana, Cybele, and ISIS and amongst the biggest flaw, the logical incoherent Trinity and the mere facts many of doctrines (Trinity, Theotokos, Original sin) was formed after Christ and the question of the anonymous authors of the Bible and the poor answer as to why “apocryphal” gospels at that time were rejected in favour of the “canonical” ones and the question of how we could trust who decides these.

Through such flaws, I eventually came to conclusion Islam is the only one I found as truth. 

I found also when defending Islam against the many arguments anti-theists, atheists, and their lovely Christian allies whose arguments they rip off throw at it, that Islam really holds strong against their criticisms and provided, specifically to me, satisfactory answers. This is one of the reasons I am not an atheist/agnostic.

Now when a new atheist tells me ‘all religions are false’, I ask them for proof. Since they like to claim there are 'quadrillion religions in the world and how I know your one is true' **(answered above)**, through their statement 'all religions are false', I coerce them into going through every single one of those quadrillion religions they claim is false and prove them to me that they are for the burden of proof is on them. 

Any theists here, do not ever feel yourself inferior to these new atheists as they try to make you feel. Play their own game against them. They are so entitled in asking you for the burden of proof even when they are the ones who go up to you saying 'God is not real' that they become offended when you tell them and rightfully so, that the burden of proof is on them for they came up to you with such a statement. Watch them squirm.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Jewish faith is different than many others. Most religions encourage proselytizing since they are founded on a belief that only members of their faith can earn an eternal reward in the afterlife. Jewish tradition makes it clear that non-Jews do not have to become Jewish in order to fulfil their spiritual purpose on Earth, and that they can earn their reward in heaven without becoming Jewish.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Judaism believes that non-Jews are obligated to observe the Seven Noahide Laws: Establishing courts of justice, not cursing God, no idolatry, no incest or adultery, no murder, no stealing and not eating the flesh of a live animal. A non-Jew who observes these laws has a place in the World to Come.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They believe that members of other faiths will have the opportunity to learn the true gospel of Jesus Christ after their earthly deaths. They will be able to accept or reject that gospel.

**Hinduism:**

What do Hindus believe about life after death? 

Taken from a WJEC GCSE Religious Studies B Religion Life Issues booklet *[4]*

--

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hinduism has very distinct teachings about life after death. Hindus accept reincarnation – the belief that, after death, the atman (soul) of a person passes into a new body and life. This new life depends on how the person lived their previous life. Hindus believe in karma, which is the sum of the good and bad actions taken. Good karma helps with a better rebirth.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As all living creatures are part of the process of reincarnation, Hindus believe it is possible to be reborn as animals, insects or plants. Humans are viewed as the highest form of life, but the goal of a Hindu is to break the cycle of reincarnation they are in and achieve Moksha. When the atman is free from the cycle, it is believed that the person returns to be with Brahman.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddhist believe in karma or 'intentional action'.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on the actions performed in previous lives, rebirth could be as a human or animal or even ghosts, demi-gods, or gods. Being born as a human is seen by Buddhists as a rare opportunity to work towards escaping this cycle of samsara. The escape from samsara is called Nirvana or enlightenment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Once Nirvana is achieved, and the enlightened individual physically dies, Buddhists believe that they will no longer be reborn.

Taken from a GCSE Bitesize Religious Studies Article found here: Life after death - Sikhism *[6]*

--

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sikhs believe in karma or 'intentional action'. Through good action and by living a good life and keeping God in their minds, Sikhs hope to achieve good merit and hope to avoid punishment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Many Sikhs believe that Waheguru lives inside everyone like a reflection in a mirror or fragrance within a flower. Through a long series of reincarnations, possibly through up to 8,400,000 forms of life, they will be purified and be able to return to Waheguru.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Each reincarnation as human or animal is temporary. Only humans can decide between right and wrong. For this reason, many Sikhs see their human life as the only time when the cycle of death and rebirth can be broken. The escape from the cycle of death and rebirth is known as Mukti.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They also want to achieve a good rebirth to improve their chances of reuniting with God. Most Sikhs believe God unites with those he is pleased with. When they have been united with Waheguru, the cycle of birth and death ends, suffering ends and the whole cycle is broken.

religion,"We are currently living in a computer simulation that debunks god, theological events (resurrection, angels, etc) and proves that nothing is real and we are nothing but code and bits by future humans, AI, and/or intelligent life. Am I right or wrong and do we live in a simulation?"," 

The simulation theory has many direct proponents supports such Elon Musk, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Sylester Gates, Nick Bostrom, and many more. The theory also has a large following base in subreddits including; however, not limited to r/glitch_in_the_matrix (600,000&lt; members), r/simulationtheory (19,000&lt; members) and several others. The first subreddit mentioned discusses supposed experiences that they have encountered that reflect the idea of us living in a matrix such as disappearing objects, shadows, teleportation, etc. The second subreddit is an apologetic subreddit that explains reasoning and ideologies regarding us living in a computational simulation. I would like to point out that the supposed glitches may not be glitches but simply the programmer (operator) playing or messing with us. The simulation theory is also indirectly supported by a majority of the worlds population (religion). Unlike the different religions with different interpretations regarding god such as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, etc, the simulation theory is an overarching theory that can explain the differences as different pathways to the same truth which is that we live in the simulation. The resurrection of Jesus Christ, the angels that Muhammad saw, John Smith, etc can be explained with a NATURALISTIC approach as simulations. Why, there could be various logical reasons. The best reasoning is that it is an experiment, the operator(s) wanted to test morality, provide us with hope in such a cruel world, see how we would react, etc. The afterlife mentioned by religion is almost a reward for our time in Earth. Every property described by religion is easily explained by simulation theory which unlike divinity and god - does not violate naturalism. The teachings of the Bible, Quran, Thorah, etc are as stated and connected by my best reasoning, simply a test for ethics. People would state that these are too assumptions, indeed they are partial assumptions; however, unlike all the differences found in religions, the simulation theory provides a consistent explanation. Atheism, the simulation theory is also consistent with Atheistic values as it provides a materialistic and naturalistic explanation for our purpose, reason, and existence here. The simulation theory can be possible unless disprove under \[Falsifiable Version\]. In this instance as mentioned under the third point of Bostrom’s thesis, we are almost certainly living in a simulation. Also, as consistent with atheism, consciousness can be materialistically created and thus, the simulation theory explains that. Atheism is also compatible with the simulation theory as it explains the Big Bang, why physics are mathematically set (as described by a astrophysicist in r/simulationtheory) and the fine-tuning of the universe of the universe (as described by Neil DeGrasse Tyson). Why can’t we be living in base reality, it is much more likely due to the high quantity of simulations that currently in living in base reality is not likely. This can be attributed to Elon Musks statement regarding a 1/1,000,000,000 chance of base reality. The reason why living in base reality is unlikely is due to statistics, non-naturalistic events including theological events which can only be explained while simultaneously conforming to naturalism if we were living in a simulation. Basically, all theological events, NDEs, potentially consciousness, etc that cannot be produced by materialism in a non-simulation world is false. But assuming those are false as Atheists have said would also support the simulation theory. This is because the simulation theory is more likely due to the quantitative statistics. So basically, what we consider as proofs of god are not proofs of anything but the fact we live in a simulation by a computer. I want to be wrong and believe in god, but the simulation theory sounds the most convincing.",1591769895.0

do folks think god didn't put doctors/medical professionals/science here for a reason? do they truly not trust in the fact that god supposedly gave us all free will to do right by ourselves, our health, our knowledge, and the people/the environment around us? 

do they really think god would throw away the lives of anyone over them being poor, ill, or sick?

do they legitimately not find it selfish as all hell to intentionally fuck over people's health, their lives, and act like god has to do everything for an individual...when we all got the free will and ability to just, be mindful of others and actually contribute to not spreading harmful diseases/helping anyone we could during this time?

it's just wild how like, the bible goes on about how we're all each other's neighbors, and how ultimately we're here to love bc we're all(just as everything created is) supposed to be in god's image. 

now i'm not saying all christians are like this but such an overwhelming amount of folks that are religious that fit these categories and w how they're acting it's like they never read past leviticus...maybe never even read the bible at all and just went off on what other folks said...

honestly i believe that's the point of us having free will of our own

i just think we shouldn't depend on god for things that we can do/fix/protect ourselves. i know we aren't god and we ultimately can't speak for god or whatever's out there but the world is literally in our hands. we are all here, together, and god/the gods/whatever have us with our free will to help ourselves",1589858723.0

religion,A Devil appreciation thread,"In   the Bible, God has women raped, children sacrificed alive in fire,   people slaughtered by bears for making a joke, punishes parents by   forcing them into murdering then cannibalizing the flesh of their own   children,  slices open the stomachs of pregnant mothers -- yanking out   and then  crushing   their babies, the list goes on. All ordained   directly by the Lord. Satan never does these things in scripture, but  God does.

In  nearly  all the  theologies, mythologies and religions, the devils have been much  more  humane and merciful than the gods. No devil ever gave   one  of  his  generals an order to kill children and to rip open the   bodies of    pregnant women. Such barbarians were always ordered by the   good gods.    The pestilences were sent by the most merciful gods. The   frightful    famine, during which the dying child with pallid lips sucked   the    withered bosom of a dead mother, was sent by the loving gods. No   devil    was ever charged with such fiendish brutality. One of these gods,      according to the account, drowned an entire world, with the exception     of  eight persons.

The old, the      young, the beautiful and the helpless were remorsely devoured by the      shoreless sea. This most fearful tragedy was the act, not of a  devil,  but of a god, so-called, whom men ignorantly worship unto this  day. What  a  stain   such an act would leave upon the character of a  devil! One  of  the   prophets of one of these gods, having in his power  a capture  king,  hewed   him in pieces in the sight of all the people.  Was ever  any imp  of any   devil guilty of such savagery? One of these  gods is  reported to  have   given the following directions concerning  human  slavery:

""If   thou buy a   Hebrew  servant, six years shall he serve, and in the   seventh he shall  go  out  free for nothing. If he came  in by himself, he   shall go out  by  himself; if he were married, then his  wife shall go   out with  him. If  his master have given him a wife, and she  have borne   him  sons or  daughters, the wife and her children shall be  her master's,    and he  shall go out by himself. And if the servant shall  plainly say,   I  love  my master, my wife and my children; I will not go  out free.   Then  his  master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also  bring   him  unto  the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall  bore   his ear   through with an awl; and he shall serve him forever.""    According to   this, a man was given liberty upon condition that he  would   desert   forever his wife and children. Did any devil ever force  upon a    husband,  upon a father, so cruel and so heartless an  alternative? Who    can  worship such a god? Who can bend the knee to  such a monster? Who   can   pray to such a fiend?

(Parallel verse in  Luke 14:26?)

All      these Gods threatened to torment forever the souls of their  enemies.     Did any devil ever make so infamous a threat? The basest  thing   recorded   of the devil, is what he did concerning Job and his  family,   and that  was  done by the express permission of one of these  gods, and   to decide a   little difference of opinion between their  serene  highness  as to the   character of ""my servant Job.""

On the case of Job,

""Then        the Lord said to Satan, “Have  you considered my servant Job?   There    is   no one on earth like him; he is  blameless and upright, a   man  who    fears  God and shuns evil. And he  still maintains his   integrity,     although you  moved me against him to  destroy him   without cause.”  (Job    2:3)

*It is notable that in 2:3, YHWH seems to be arguing that he is not ultimately responsible for Job's loss:* ""... although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause."" *This         is a very strange line, since Satan was not reported as doing       anything   but state an opinion about the shallowness of human  loyalty.      Indeed,   Satan never suggested destroying Job, and YHWH  himself   never    allowed   such a drastic move. What is YHWH doing  here? Is it    possible   that he is   wrestling with his own demons, a  bit    guilt-ridden? And if   he has this   feeling, why does he again  hand    over power without being   asked to do so?*

It's     a minor  addendum, but I think it's noteworthy that when Satan     enters,  he's  merely talking about what he's been doing, possibly with     the   connotation of looking for something to do. In essence, God is    the  one   to initiate the challenge with Satan by suggesting Job. As   suggested   with the first paragraph, this places even further     responsibility on   God.

Job 1:7-8

The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”

Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”

Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? 

&amp;#x200B;

And thus ensues the bet of 2 demons playing with a man's life for sport.

God recommended and encouraged Satan to destroy Job's life, even including murdering his kin and servants. Innumerable human lives are toyed with in the process, many times resulting in death. It's a tyrannical dictator slaughtering whomever he sees fit just to prove a point--or hell, if we're going to be more specific with the case of Job, it's one who makes a casual recommendation to the local arsonist and serial killer. A challenge, more like. 

Also considering the fact that the Biblical God is omniscient knowing all the events of the future, including that which Satan would respond with, this further goes to show the immorality of God in initiating the challenge with Satan by suggesting Job. 

Had the introductory bit not existed--God's bet with Satan--there could've been far many more interpretations to that story, but if this book is indeed God-breathed, then even as a mere parable, its message should ring true: that human lives are but fodder to God when his pride is at stake and that those who question him after such acts are to be silenced. 

The first account we have of  the devil is   found in that purely scientific book called Genesis, and  is as  follows:

""Now   the serpent  was more subtle than any beast of the field  which the    Lord God had  made, and he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God  said, Ye    shall not eat  of the fruit of the trees of the garden? And   the  woman  said unto the  serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees   of  the  garden; but of  the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of   the   garden God hath  said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye   touch   it, lest ye die.  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall   not   surely die. For God  doth know that in the day ye eat thereof,  then   your  eyes shall be  opened and ye shall be as gods, knowing good  and   evil. And  when the  woman saw that the tree was good for good,  and that   it was  pleasant to  the eyes, and a tree to be desired to  make one  wise,  she  took of the  fruit thereof and did eat, and gave  also unto  her  husband  with her,  and he did eat....

And     the Lord  God said, Behold the man is become as one of us, knowing   good   and  evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of   the  tree   of life and eat, and live forever. Therefore the Lord God   sent him    forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from which   he was    taken. So he drove out the man, and he placed at the east of   the Garden    of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword, which turned every   way to keep    away any from the tree of life.

According      to this account the promise of the devil was fulfilled to the very   letter. Adam and Eve did not die, and they did become as gods, knowing      good and evil.

The account   shows,    however, that the gods dreaded education and knowledge then   just as   they  do now. The church still faithfully gaurds the dangerous   tree of    knowledge, and has exerted in all ages her utmost power to   keep mankind    from eating the fruit thereof. The priests have never   ceased  repeating   the old falsehood and the old threat: ""Ye shall not   eat of  it, neither   shall ye touch it, lest ye die."" From every  pulpit  comes  the same cry,   born of the same fear: ""Lest they eat and  become  as  gods, knowing good   and evil.""

From every pulpit comes the same cry,   born of the same fear: ""Lest they eat and become as gods, knowing good    and evil."" For this reason, faith detests reason, theology is thhe   sword  enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming sword still   gaurds  the hated tree, and like its supposed founder, curses to the   lowest  depths the brave thinkers who eat and become as gods. If the   account  given in Genesis is really true, ought we not, after all, to   thank this  serpent? He was the first schoolmaster, the first advocate   of learning,  the first enemy of ignorance, the first to whisper in   human ears the  sacred word liberty, the creator of ambition, the author   of modesty, of  inquiry, of doubt, of investigation, of progress and   civilization. Give  me the storm and the tempest of thought and action,   rather than the dead  calm of ignorance and faith! Banish me from Eden   when you will; but  first let me eat of the fruit of the tree of   knowledge!

religion,The concept of 'religion' is a strawman secularism invented,"""Religion is a strawman that secularism invented. 

The 'religious' (and thus something opposed to the secular) is a concept that wouldn't have been recognized by more ancient societies: there is no single word in ancient Greek or Latin, nor in the Hebrew Bible, nor in Arabic that we can accurately translate as “religion.” (And no, deen is not religion, it predates the word by more than a thousand years.)

In ancient times, people were simply referred to by their nations and the gods they worshipped, such as the Phoenicians worshippers of Hu-bal, or the Assyrians worshippers of Ashur, etc. The Arabs were worshippers of Lat, Uzza and Manat.

The Arabs were sent a divine message that reminded them of an ancient monotheism from which they had lost their way, that of Abraham. The Lord God; El, Elohim, Eloi, Elah (also transliterated as Allah), was whom they were commanded to serve, and shun all false deities.

If we were to focus on the Most High, we would engage in the most productive and inspiring conversations that'd explore who God is, what He wants, how, and what the mutual relationship means, rather than angst-inducing debate on dogma or pedantry on the details of ritualisms.

The construct of religion imputes on us a way of thinking about the world which demarcates our interaction with the God of Abraham on one side, and interaction with the material world on other. This is a false dichotomy.

religion,"Jeffrey Dahmer the human cannibal repented of his sins and believed the gospel. His repentance was Biblical and sincere from the heart. Biblically he was saved. Biblically those victims he brutalized, were they unconverted, went to hell. The Bible teaches the saved celebrate over those in Hell","I've always thought the free will argument was a strange one. It's usually put forward as an answer to the problem of evil:

&amp;#x200B;

""Why does a good God stand idly by while people do wicked things to one another?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Because he allows us the freedom to choose our own actions,"" the Christians reply.

&amp;#x200B;

The     idea that he then punishes those who choose wicked actions seems     acceptable on its face when you think of it as applying to rapists and     murderers.

&amp;#x200B;

But     when you learn that the punishment of infinite hellfire, agony and     torture applies not based on the many daily choices to do good things  or    refrain from wicked things, but instead on the single choice to   accept   Jesus as your Lord and saviour it sounds much less reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

Were you born human? Doomed to hell then.

&amp;#x200B;

Did you r\*pe someone? Same punishment. Nothing worse than you were already getting.

&amp;#x200B;

Did     you commit wholesale genocide of entire peoples and cultures? Same     punishment, no worse than just having been born an ordinary human.

&amp;#x200B;

Or     in the case of the notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, commit    r\*pe,  dismemberment, necrophilia, and cannibalism, and at the end of    his  life, having truly, in the Biblical sense, ""Repented and believed"",      received heaven as his reward.

&amp;#x200B;

And     as Jesus said, ""none who come to me will I cast out"", so in order  for  a   Christian to be consistent, he must accept the idea that Dahmer   will  be  in heaven alongside him. If you do not believe me, go and  read  about   Dahmer's conversion in prison, and you will see just how   sincere he  was  in his repentance and faith in Christ. More so perhaps,   than many  of  you.

&amp;#x200B;

To    those unfamiliar with  Christian theology it may sound crazy to you I    know, that a person like  Dahmer would have gone to heaven. But in a    moment I will show you why it  is not as shocking as it may seem. What    is really sad however, is that  according to the Bible, if his  victims   whom he cannibalized weren't  Christians, they went to hell--  while he   went to heaven. Those people he  cannibalized, stored in his    refridgerator, r\*ped and continued to r\*pe  while dead, this vile    murderer... according to the Bible, did all that  was necessary to    attain salvation. In the Bible, dying a horrific death  does not give a    person a free ticket to heaven. Only faith in Jesus  does.

&amp;#x200B;

Although     these crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer seem insane and unforgivable to you,     something a God would never forgive, might I remind you that God in  the    Bible also has parents murder and then cannibalize the flesh of  their    own children.

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of sick, twisted being would actually take child cannibalism seriously?

&amp;#x200B;

There’s actually an answer to that question, believe it or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Again,     the answer is, God — according to the Bible. God was allegedly    obsessed  with the concept, which is a bit disturbing.  Especially when    it  concerned people who didn’t get along with his commands.  As    Leviticus  26: 27-29 reads:

&amp;#x200B;

If     … you still do not listen to me but continue to be hostile toward  me,    then in my anger I will be hostile toward you, and I myself will   punish   you for your sins seven times over. You will eat the flesh of   your  sons  and the flesh of your daughters.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s a bit sick and twisted, if ya ask me.

&amp;#x200B;

But wait, there’s more!  Check out these juicy details of the punishments of God.

&amp;#x200B;

Deuteronomy 28:53-57:

Because     of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege,  you    will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and  daughters  the   Lord your God has given you. Even the most gentle and  sensitive  man   among you will have no compassion on his own brother or  the wife  he   loves or his surviving children, and he will not give to  one of  them any   of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It  will be  all he has   left because of the suffering your enemy will  inflict on  you during the   siege of all your cities. The most gentle  and sensitive  woman among   you—so sensitive and gentle that she would  not venture to  touch the   ground with the sole of her foot—will  begrudge the husband  she loves and   her own son or daughter the  afterbirth from her womb and  the children   she bears. For in her dire  need she intends to eat them  secretly  because  of the suffering your  enemy will inflict on you  during the  siege of  your cities.

So God brings about and fulfills what he promised prior through the use of an invading army.

&amp;#x200B;

Amos 3:6 reads,

""Does Disaster Come to a City Unless the LORD Has Done It?""

implying no, disasters such as this do not occur unless God directly decrees for them to occur and has them happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember     the part where he said, ""I myself will punish you for your sins  seven    times over. You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh  of your    daughters."" The way God went about in bringing this to  fruition is    through the use of an invading army, as he does elsewhere  in scripture,    such as  Zechariah 14:2, ""I will gather the gentile  nations to    Jerusalem.. and the women shall be r\*ped."" The parents are  murdering and    cannibalizing their children as a result of God's  punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

So…yeah.  Serves you right nonbelievers.  You don’t follow God and you’ll dine on babies.

&amp;#x200B;

And     there’s an encore:  In Jeremiah 19:9, God, according to Jeremiah,   will   punish those who don’t follow him in the following way, quote:

&amp;#x200B;

""I     will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they    will  eat one another’s flesh because their enemies will press the  siege   so  hard against them to destroy them.""

&amp;#x200B;

The God of love and justice is going to **“make them”** eat their sons and daughters as punishment for not following him...

&amp;#x200B;

God gets off on this— due to all the juicy details — on making them do it.

&amp;#x200B;

And     then in Ezekiel 5:10, Ezekiel says that God says to the non-Judeo     Jerusalem that, because they don’t follow Him, the following will     happen, quote:

&amp;#x200B;

""Therefore     in your midst parents will eat their children, and children will eat     their parents. I will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all     your survivors to the winds.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now,     I know what you are thinking.  Does the Bible have any good    baby-eating  recipes?  I’m glad you asked.  There’s cooking, which you    might have to  schedule — same-day boiling keeps the meat fresh, so you    may not want  to kill both children in the same day (although you  want   to make sure  there’s some kind of safeguard to make sure no one  backs   out.  As 2nd  Kings 6:28-29 says, when relaying a conversation  between   two women being  punished by God via a siege for Israel’s sin,  quote:

&amp;#x200B;

Then he asked her, “What’s the matter?

&amp;#x200B;

”She     answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat  him    today, and tomorrow we’ll eat my son.’ So we cooked my son and  ate  him.   The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat  him,’  but   she had hidden him.”

&amp;#x200B;

Again,     although the crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer seem insane and unforgivable  to    you, something a good and just God would never forgive nor imitate   (or   is Dahmer imitating God?), God in the Bible has the same moral    character  of a  Jeffrey Dahmer. Children have suffered this fate at  the   hands of  their own parents because of your God. Please, take a  moment   and  consider your God. His morality is equal to that of the  lowest of   human  scum. Yet people sing songs of praise, ""How great is  our God"",   ""Blessed  is the Lord"", ""Thy Kingdom Come, thy will be  done"", are you   saying that  of this very God that commits such evil,  is it his will   that you desire  to be done? On earth as it is in  heaven?

&amp;#x200B;

As   horrible as necrophilia and  cannibalism is, they aren't the   unforgivable sins. And we know from  scripture that God himself in   scripture condoned, committed, and gave  orders for r\*pe as well.

&amp;#x200B;

So back to the main point here,

&amp;#x200B;

Were you born and accepted Jesus? Heaven for you then.

&amp;#x200B;

Did     you r\*pe, murder, lie, cheat, steal, r\*pe dead bodies, cannibalize   and   commit genocide but then repent and find Jesus? Off to heaven with   you   and you can watch the fiery torment of any of your victims who   weren't   Christian alongside the angels with some popcorn.

&amp;#x200B;

There     is nothing moral in this system. It is arbitrary and imposed from    above  by force on powerless victims. Slaves in other words.

&amp;#x200B;

It     is no true freedom or morality for God to say to us ""The choice is     entirely yours, just know that I want you to choose me and if you  don't    I'll torture you in fire until the end of time. Now what is  your    decision of your own free will?""",1602958465.0

religion,How can you disbelieve in the Qur'an when it has so many miracles.,"Hi, Im a muslim. Im just curious how someone can deny the Qur'an when it clearly has so many points that theres no way a human couldve written 1400 years ago. Here are some amongst many

Big Bang theory:
“Have not those who disbelieved known that the heavens and the earth were one connected entity, then We separated them?...” (Quran 21:30)

Nebulas(creation of solar systems):
“Then He turned to the heaven when it was smoke...” (Quran 41:11)

When Romans lost the Quran said they will win in 3-9 years which is very rare and it actually happend
The Romans have been defeated in the lowest land, but after their defeat they will soon be victorious.  Within three to nine years.  The decision of the matter, before and after, is with God.” (Quran 30:2-4)

Ur pain receptors are inside ur skin
 When they burn u wont feel pain in that specific spot. Allah said that in hellfire, their skins would be constantly replaced so they taste the everlasting pain
Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses - We will drive them into a Fire. Every time their skins are roasted through We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted in Might and Wise(Quran 4:56)

religion,Why do many Americans and Europeans have wrong ideas about Arabs and Muslims?? why do they follow what the media says only?,"I am an Arab Muslim , and I can tell you the following:

1- Only radical extremist Muslims are terrorists who love to kill non-Muslims:

Our holy book the Quran doesn't tell us to kill non-Muslims, but it tells us to live in peace with them and treat them just like Muslims , and only fight them if they fight us in a war to defend ourselves , and all those Muslim terrorists such as Taliban, Al Qaeda, and Isis are just radical extremists who don't represent true Islam , and we don't even acknowledge them , and there are radical extremists in every religion who don't really represent the religion itself , and that is because true Islam doesn't really tell us to kill innocent non-Muslims , and there are actually many Christians and people from different religions who live and work in Muslim countries without problems and they are treated just like Muslims , and I even have Christian friends.

2- We don't really hate Jews and Christians:

As I said before , the Quran tells us to live with non-Muslims peacefully and not harm them or hate them for who they are , and we don't really hate Jews and Christians , but we just hate the Zionist state of Israel and those who support its actions to expand their land and kill the Palestinians , but we have no problem with non-Zionist Jewish people and Christians who don't support Israel and its actions, and there are even Jewish and Christian Arabs and non-Arabs living in Muslim Arab countries in peace and treated just like Muslims.

3- We don't really hate LGBTQ people:

As I said before, the Quran tells us not to hate people for who they are , but just apply the laws of Quran as Muslims , and the Quran says that homosexuality is a sin , and that is why homosexuality is a sin for us Muslims and it's a punishable crime if homosexual affection is displayed in public because it's against our religion and laws , but we don't really hate homosexuals for who they are and they have rights just like any other people but the display of homosexuality in public is a crime because it violates the laws of religion and society. The bible also says that homosexuality is a sin if you really read the bible , but some Christian countries chose to ignore the bible and allow homosexuality in the name of freedom.

4- We also believe in Jesus , but only as a non-divine human prophet sent by God like any other prophet:

Yes we Muslims believe in Jesus too , but we believe that Jesus was just a non-divine human prophet sent by God and given miracles by God just like any other prophet to convince people that God is true. we don't believe that Jesus is God or the son of God or that he was divine , and we also don't believe that Jesus died....but we believe that Jesus was raised to the skies above by God and then he will come back to earth again at the end of times. Actually Jesus is mentioned in the Quran more than our prophet Muhammad.

5- Not all Muslim men wear turbans on their heads , and we don't really live in deserts or caves with camels , and we don't speak only Arabic:

Muslim countries are modern in everything like any other country , and we have skyscrapers , villas, palaces, buildings, cars , computers , advanced medicine , technology , education, music, movies and speak multiple languages and everything like any other country , and we also wear shirts , t-shirts , jeans and all types of clothes , and only Muslims in some countries like the Arab gulf countries wear turbans on their heads as part of their traditional clothes (it's named Keffiyeh if you wanna search it, and not like turbans that Sikhs wear on their heads) , and of course Muslim women are required to cover their hair and whole bodies in the presence of strange men as instructed by the Quran (the piece of cloth used to cover the hair is named Hijab),  but not all Muslim women cover their hair , and some Muslim women don't wear Hijab , but it's fine not to wear Hijab in Muslim countries and it's not punishable by law.

6- Not all Muslims are Arabs , and not all Arabs are Muslims:

For example Pakistan, Iran , Afghanistan , Malaysia, Indonesia , Nigeria , and Bosnia are Muslim countries but they are not Arab, Arabic is not their mother tongue. An example of a non-Arab Muslim person is the late American boxer Muhammad Ali. Also Arabs are not all Muslims , there are Christian and Jewish Arabs too.",1588555988.0

religion,Roman Assimilation of Previous Religions &amp; Theories,"Predating the tree of knowledge we have Nordic myth with story how Loki tricked humans into eating fruit that was set aside for only the Gods on Mt. Olympus hereby getting Loki and the humans in a lot of trouble.

We can see how later the Israelis presented Jesus who was also stolen by the Romans and added to the Bible.

So all sciences, theories, conjectures and myths were being absconded to reflect the will of the Roman Empire and it's political policies.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the Bible not being original the way the stories were re-written into a new religion made a lot of those stories deeper than what I believe the Romans realized

&amp;#x200B;

So is this where divine intervention is active? A mind within the mind of the Roman plaguirists influencing their authoring so that much of the Bible can be taken in contexts invisible to the Roman authors even as they recorded those deeper concepts?

&amp;#x200B;

What do I mean by deeper concepts?

&amp;#x200B;

Well the original Loki myth seemed to promote that one should not steal from those more powerful than them and that only the best should be held aside for the more powerful

&amp;#x200B;

Yet the Bible takes the same story, removes the selfishly arrogant lesson, and replaces it with an esoteric backhanded illustration that can be interpreted in two critical ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Conspirators don't like claptraps and whistleblowers

&amp;#x200B;

or

&amp;#x200B;

2. Seeking to learn from a hierarchy of texts from past thinkers, texts which have branched off in many ways can not only lose an individual in existential crisis but some discoveries can learn to eternal death such the confirmation that one (and their world) is artificial and that organic life was only an illusion.

There are a couple of other important ideas the concept introduces such as sometimes in order for teachers to get rebellious students to pay mind they have to make what they are teaching a taboo.

Ex. You will originally think of a family member of the same sex, and then the Devil will tell you it is a friend of the opposite sex, all the while he tells you that you are the one who is thinking of such, yet you gave in to the temptation originally, knowing you didnt have to give in...

religion,I had a revelation tonight.,"I have been a Christian all my life, albeit a relatively progressive one who explores a lot of other traditions. And I don’t go to church that often. But I live my life according to the teachings of Jesus and I take pride in that. 

I have a pretty extensive collection of spiritual texts. For those curious I have listed them at the end of this. But anyway I was going through them today and I decided to reread The Gospel of Thomas. I have had I think 4 profound spiritual peak experiences in my life (including tonight, 3 positive, 1 negative). Two of those experiences I was reading The Gospel of Thomas (including tonight).

So I read it and it got me thinking back to an encounter I had with God several years ago when I was going through a rough patch. God spoke to me during that experience and one thing I learned was about the oneness of everything. 

Anyway, I was pondering that concept again, and picked up Richard Hooper’s book about parallel sayings. And as I was reading it it hit me like a shockwave: everything’s connected. All the world’s major traditions are part of the same Divine Truth. Some part of me knew this all along but didn’t want to believe it.

When the revelation hit me at first I resisted it. But I kept getting sign after sign and epiphany after epiphany until I began to weep with awe. I feel like I finally get it now. I somehow knew this Truth deep down inside all along and now I’ve finally embraced it. 

Gnostic Christianity may not have had as credible source material as traditional Christianity, but some elements of it must be true and it’s a shame the world was robbed of any hint of the truths it possessed. 

There’s common threads between all these traditions for a reason. They’re all pieces to the same puzzle. I know that now and I’m so grateful to God for revealing that to me. And I think the Gospel of Thomas is the key to it all.

I really don't know if this is bigotry or not as I am asking this as a question and not as a critisism since I want these facts corrected if they are incorrect!

Okay, hear me out:
If God created the angels didn't he technically create sin too? Lucifer was an angel and from what I understand he was banished to hell for having a different opinion and wanting rights among his kind; Lucifer promoted diversity and choice where as God banned this and punished those who wanted it and labelled them as 'demons'.

I even have an explanation for the seven deadly 'sins' are just forms of control created by God so he can remain in power and have his views projected as 'pure' and correct. The seven sins are lust, greed, gluttony, pride, sloth, envy and wrath; these are some examples:
• Greed= Showing your achievements through material means and wishing for more can represent the increased aspiration to succeed which links to pride and accepting what you should praise as God's accomplishments as your own.
• Gluttony= I believe this sin is linked to the consumption of the apple during the origional sin linking to the sin of greed and the aspiration for knowledge- knowledge can educate us on diversity and create personality so this is banned to keep control by influencing the false consiousness and removing personal success and will through greed and pride.
• Pride= Pride is accepting your accomplishments as your own, for example: if you studied hard for a test and got a good grade claiming that grade was the product of your hard work and not the will of God is the 'sin' of pride.
• Sloth= The 'sin' of sloth is related to not attending church. This is literally the sin of not conforming to the mass population and creating diversity. If anything, sloth highlights how vain God is so isn't he feeling pride and greed himself eventhough he is suppost to be a symbol of purity and divinity?
• Wrath= I see this as a link to Lucifer and his rebellion preventing people from acting out on their desires and preventing negative emotions prevents another revolution brainwashing the angels into a false consiousness.

Don't get me wrong I am not claiming that some individuals don't take these sins to the extreme through corrupt means and ideals (I do believe these should be punished), however, if God and religion was about forgiveness and purity why are those who don't conform supposedly punished through fire and anguish?

religion,What religions have to problem with the scientific consensus on natural history?,"Virtually all Christians either outright deny evolution, or believe in some sort of compromise (such as old-earth creationism or theistic evolution). Beyond natural science and Christianity, I've heard its become popular for Hindus to deny the moon landings (due to their scriptures claiming the moon is further from the Earth than the sun). Honestly, I think its ironic seeing they don't seem to take nearly as much issue with evolution as Americans do.

I've heard that neo-pagans (of the Wiccan variety anyway) take no issue with any scientific findings. I also once read that occultists have no issue with scientific findings, and even factor scientific discoveries into their own world view (though not in the way new agers do).

I've been wondering for a while though, how common it actually is for religions to take issue with things like evolution and the age of the universe and whatnot? I know all the Abrahamic religions do (besides maybe the Vatican, I know they say evolution is compatible with faith, but I don't know how many catholics actually believe in this), but what about non-Abrahamic religions? As for neo-paganism, I think Wicca accepts the scientific narrative of natural history, but I don't know about other neo-pagans. Other forms of neo-paganism do have creation myths, and I did once find a video of some kemetic pagan denying that the brain was the seat of intelligence. But really, how common is stuff like this? I was a New Atheist for nearly a decade of my life, and so I believed the myth that all religions deny all of science. This obviously isn't true; even young-earth creationists don't normally take issue with any scientific theories outside of evolution. And I know this, because I live in a community overrun with them. And I've never come out to my parents about my lack of belief, and so I still attended church frequently. I've even attended evangelical churches (one of them for a few years). I can assure you from experience, how they're depicted in the media is at best a gross exaggeration of what they're actually like. And I have seem some of the more fanatical varieties too. Just to give an example, that one evangelical church I used to go seriously believed in faith healing, but when a woman started to have a heart attack in the middle of service, they didn't hesitate to call an ambulance. They believed in faith healing full-heartedly and even talked about it quite frequently, but even they acknowledged it wasn't 100% reliable. As for that woman, they just took her into a back room and prayed over her until the ambulance arrived. They also supported praying over patients in hospitals, obviously. And I do seriously believe that church likely has a lot of Trump supporters in it now, because they seriously came across as that type (that, and they are the norm around here either way).",1592620961.0

religion,Those who believe in just one god...why?,It doesn’t personally make sense especially when said god is beyond wrathful and cruel and just all around a dick.,1583869219.0
religion,God 4.0,"There is a concept emerging amongst certain religious thinkers called 'God 4.0'. It's interesting in as much as it outflanks both the literalist atheists and the literalist religionists they oppose. It offers a quite different view of what is essentially a human concept of God which is evolving.

Given that human concepts of God *are* evolving, it is father facile to argue against God as an abstract possibility by using the benchmark of a human concept which is an ongoing development. It's basically like arguing against the jet engine by proving that the Wright Brothers made a biplane. 

Basically God 4.0 postulates three human ideas of God with a fourth that is just emerging now. These are respectively:

**God 1.0: A Tiered Cosmos**
From about 35,000 years ago and over the next 25,000 years, facing the extreme hardships of the last Ice Age, our Paleolithic ancestors engaged in shamanistic rituals deep inside protective caves to induce altered state of consciousness and connect with the spirit worlds above and below.

**God 2.0: Many Gods**
At the end of the Ice Age and for the next 10,000 years, from the Neolithic Era to the collapse of the Bronze Age, civilizations from Mesopotamia to Ancient China developed religious hierarchies to appease multiple gods and maintain order.

**God 3.0: One God**
Beginning about 3,000 years ago, exponential growth of populations forced tribes formerly isolated from one another to come into close contact with others of very different backgrounds. Different beliefs and values became more obvious; conflict, war, disease and death became more frequent; and human beings over the world began to reflect en masse about the meaning and purpose of life and death. This spawned the rise of the Axial Age sages and the great monotheistic religions, each of which began with an enlightened prophet but then morphed into the institutions that continue to dominate our religious world today.

**God 4.0: Conscious Evolution**
Findings in psychology, neuroscience, genetics, and paleontology, along with post-war discoveries of ancient religious texts, now help us see how a transcendent shift in consciousness that some have called “seeing God” is produced. Locked inside one’s brain and mind is a reality that people have sought forever. Learning to unlock this reality could shift our imagination of who we are and what is possible, and help us unite around a common higher perspective.

&gt;Throughout history as people have asked “What is God?” and as they’ve been exploring the idea, those ideas have changed, deepened and evolved.

&gt;There was a time when we believed the spirits of animals and the natural world were magical and protective forces, that version of God, what I call God 1.0, began to give way to God 2.0 when we started to give those spirits names: Thor God of lightening, Poseidon God of the sea. A God for everything you can imagine.

&gt;Eventually, from the cast of Godly characters, a head God emerged and that God began to replace all the others. Now there was only one God: God 3.0 and His name is Yawheh, Brahmin, Satnam, Jehovah…

&gt;It’s that view, God 3.0, that is our current view of God. The one who looks over His creation (because God 3.0 is almost always male), tinkers with it, listens to prayers, answers some.

&gt;It seems to me that books like Christopher Hitchen’s God is Not Great or Richard Dawkins’ The God Delusion and even the books that counter those books like Alister McGrath’s Dawkin’s God and John Polkinghorne’s Belief in God in an Age of Science are all debating the existence or non-existence of God 3.0.

&gt;What is God 4.0?

&gt;God 4.0 is the combination of our religious ideas about God combined with some revolutionary ideas about God. It’s a view of God that embraces science. Above all God 4.0 allows room for ideas about God to be wrong.

&gt;God 4.0 is our drive to Harmony. It’s a drive we confuse and misuse. But at its core all human endeavours have yearned for that goal: to create harmony.

&gt;More than ever in our world we need a clear idea of what Harmony is and how we create it. With the rise of right wing populism in the West, and a sense of hope diminishing for many, we need a drive to real harmony more than ever. A harmony where our only yardstick is whether our actions bring universal benefit or harm. It’s a simple measure.

&gt;Real harmony connects us to God 4.0. It’s that harmony that changes the way we see the world, our place in it, and offers a yardstick for the way we choose to live. God 4.0 shows us no country is blessed; there is no concern about what we eat or drink and no view on how we dress or who we love.

&gt;In God 4.0 there is no justification for treating others badly. Nobody speaks on behalf of God 4.0 and no one can justify their actions with an ancient book. That’s the vision and the hope of God 4.0. A practical spirituality.

religion,My own religion. Followers: 1,"I think spirituality has some real significance. I’m agnostic above anything else but I sometimes think there could be some kind of higher power. I believe that ‘god’ is just a personification of the subconscious mind and it’s intent is to guide us towards making the right decisions. 

My problem with religion is, I think all religions have somewhat good intent, until they get corrupted and fucked up, using fear, ignorance, and shame to control followers. I think most people are doing religion all wrong. Look at all the pedophilia running rampant in the Catholic Church and how the Pope is just like “Whatever bruh” and defends the pedophiles. I think the pope is delusional in the sense that he thinks he’s going to heaven, but his arrogance and ignorance of his sin will make him burn in hell (if there is some sort of hell). I think a big part of the problem is when egos get too big, people get delusional. I think humans are naturally ‘spiritual’ and certain people take advantage of that. Any religion that uses fear tactics is bad. Any religion that strays from common sense is bad. 

I believe religions sole purpose is to guide us all on our path to being the best we can be for ourselves and others. If life is a game, religion is like a rulebook / strategy guide.

I want my religion to be completely based on common sense. 

Common sense such as, don’t harm or kill people. Don’t steal. Don’t try and control other people, etc.

That’s all common sense of what NOT to do. Then there’s common sense of good things that you should (voluntarily) do, such as being reliable, being kind, supporting your community, living healthy, etc. 

When personal biases get into religion, shit gets ridiculous and hard to take seriously from a common sense perspective. Stuff like banning certain foods, same sex marriage, use of drugs, etc. 

One of the main commandments of my religion will be “Do what you wish, as long as it does not harm others and their wellbeing”. For example, you smoking weed should not be forbidden just because the people in charge of the religion don’t like it. 

Unhealthy choices like tobacco can be discouraged (not forbidden), but personal use should still be allowed because freedom is essential. You should be free to paint your lungs with tar if that is how you feel like living your life. It’s not a healthy or smart way of living but once again, freedom is essential. 

Another thing I don’t like is how much stuff in religion is pulled out of peoples asses. When people claim to talk to god, or believe that the world was created 6000 years ago, etc, that’s fine, BUT if you start trying to force those ideas on others, you’re a prick. 

Theres over 70 religions in the world. Picking one of them is just stupid and goes against common sense. I personally think of it like “If I just be a good person, any god will accept me”

A truly good, common sense God would not give a shit if you got his name wrong. All he would care about is your actions, sins and good deeds.

One of my commandments will be “Accept that life is a mystery and not a single person knows why were here, or what happens when we die”. If you can accept that nobody knows if there even is a god or not, then you can truly arrive at common sense. 

“To know, is to know that you know nothing. That is the meaning of true knowledge.” 
- Socrates

This quote is the most important thing to accept if you want to really try and fend off ignorance in your own psyche.

Religion shouldn’t require you to believe things that you don’t believe. Good religion should allow diversity of thoughts and ideas. 

TLDR: Religion has the potential to be so damn good but there’s tons of problems with the religions we have now.

I believe in them, as in I believe they exist. What I do not do is I do not believe them; as in, I do not trust them. 

I view gods as mementic entities. In other words, they're like a self-aware computer program or a computer virus or artificial intelligence (varies by god which its more like) except for our brains. They are conscious and living ideas that inhabit the hardware of our brains and travel the network of our communication. 

They lie to us constantly, brag about their great  acheivements so that way we 'worship' them (in other words, devote mental processing time to their existence and maintenance). There is nothing mystical or spiritual about them. 

Can they perform miracles? It varies. They are root deep and get in our brains and do stuff we're not aware of. In that regard, they can pull off great feats. They are not against trades. Donate a lot to churches? Watch a miraculous surge in your political campaign. Sing their praises with a large crowd? They might just gift you with a mass-hallucinated themed-LCD-trip-equivalent. Need 'spiritual healing'? They'll at least convince you there's no problem and help you kick off your body's natural pain-killers, so you don't stress, which will move you towards homeostasis so hopefully your body might be able to recover easier. Can they make you walk on water or split the moon or grab a river? No. But they can make you (and everyone around you) think you did. 

And any time we make a new god as part of a story or a joke or some other reason? That's still a new god that spreads by its own means, methods, and purposes.

religion,Time to recognize that Catholicism is the same religion as Christianity,"When people talk about the major world religions they very often treat “Christianity” and Catholicism as completely separate religions. I always see lists that goes something like: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Catholicism, Hinduism etc. If you only ever studied Christianity you'd be forgiven to think that the differences between Catholicism and other Christian denominations are so monumental that the two must be completely different religions. But the same amount of difference can be found in most major religions, and I would argue that the differences between Shia and Sunni Islam, as well as Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism are way, way bigger than Catholicism and “Christianity”. I don't know that much about the other major religions but seems like there are some pretty big differences in those too.     
  

So why does Catholicisms essentially get its own category? Sure it is a really big Church, but Sunni Islam is actually a bit bigger in terms of adherence. Well you can argue that Catholics has been in many major conflicts with other denominations, but again the same can be said for Islam.     
  

My issue with it is this -  these religion categories where originally constructed by the European superpowers during the middle ages, a time when even the most educated Europeans did not know anything about non-Christian religions. Scholars did not even know much about Judaism, a religion which co-existed with Christianity in the Europe. As a result, when mapping out the major religions of the world they originally arrived at the conclusion that there where 4 traditions – Catholicism, Islam, Judaism and Paganism. Then a few hundred years later there was a schism and Christianity was split in two – those who where with the Catholic Church and those who where not. Also the colonial area had started and during it's course Europeans came to learn that there are different kinds of “pagans”, and the labels Hinduism, and eventually Buddhism was popularized. Do you see why it is problematic? The current categorization system comes from a colonial and Catholic paradigm.     
  

Currently It seems like western academia is slowly starting to acknowledge that the conventional  “world religions” is problematic. It looks like Sikhi and Jainism is starting to be recognized as  different from Hinduism. The term “Indigenous religion” is no longer applied to Shinto and there seems to be genuine effort to map out what is “shamanism” and “animism”. But working towards a fair and unbiased categorization of world religions does in my opinion mean once and for all merging the unique Catholicism category with all other denominations of Christianity. Alternatively we could give all traditions the same treatment. But at that point the categories would be so many it might not be useful.        
  

Perhaps I am making a big issue out of a minor thing. But it is rather offensive. Think about a world where China was the colonizer and everyone agreed that the world religions are  Mahayana, Islam, Theravada, Christianity, Vajrayana and Hinduism. (Judaism is under Christianity here, just as Sikhism is often under Hinduism) .

religion,Religion and science are alike.,"As a rule, people don't learn about reality by looking at reality. They learn about reality from other people. From *authorities* and *the mass of people around them* (which is basically another kind of authority). 

The authority tells us a *story about what reality is*. And that's reality.

Yes, I know, *what about science*? But most people don't actually do science.

And for that matter, most religious people don't actually do *religious investigation* either. They don't fast or meditate or renounce material pursuits or see God or spirits or do any of that mystical existential investigatory stuff. They just listen to their authorities. Just like everybody else.

So the scientific people and religious people are alike in this way. Reality is a story they are told. 

And the people who do the actual scientific or religious investigation are actually quite rare. And they talk funny. And we call them weirdos.

As for the actual difference between real laboratory-grade religion and science, I guess it's in the style of the investigation. In the style of experimentation and exploration.

When we're talking about conventional science we're basically talking about investigation of phenomena that exist within the common default perspective. Anybody can observe a falling apple. Or a lightning bolt. You don't have to fast for 40 days to see that.

religion,"IF you are religious AND you believe that your specific creed is the only way to avoid some version of eternal torment, then it is immoral to not try and force people into it","So, firstly, if you believe that god cares about how you came by your beliefs (ie it doesn't count if you were brainwashed into them) then this doesn't really apply so much.

Basically, I know that there are many christians out there who believe something to the effect of ""the only way to god is through christ"" and if you drill down deep enough, you'll find that they believe lifestyles not congruent with their strain of christianity will ultimately lead to eternal torment, with the caveat that God is the ultimate judge. However, while they believe God could be lenient if he so chose, their personal belief is that, odds on, non christians are bound for hell.

So, if the above describes you, it is your moral duty to proselytise, and take any means necessary, up to and including torture and brainwashing (I believe this is a means that can change peoples' beliefs, if i am wrong please correct me). You should be undermining basic freedoms if it serves the goal of converting as many people as possible. If you believe that peaceful ""preach it and they will come"" is the most effective means, but if you believe that the best way to change create more christians is authoritarian control from birth then you should advocate for that, since that is most likely to keep more people out of hell.

religion,Wicca and Witchcraft are not true paganism.,"I'm not meaning to start a fight here, but I get annoyed when I see Witchcraft or Wicca claim paganism, because modern European Witchcraft is derived from late 19th and early 20th century movements such Thelema. Wicca in particular was founded in the 1950s.

What these all have in common with each other is a modern origin based vaguely on Western religions that predate Christianity. 

By comparison, Celtic, Roman, Hellenic, Gallic and Germanic paganism, among others, are reconstructions of historical religions that often were relatively well documented and significant cultural and theological traditions exist.

My argument is that through witchcraft cleaning the label of pagan, it conflates two movements that are completely and totally separated from each other and thus results in significant confusion to outsiders. 

Simply put I would say that the easiest way to resolve this is to have witchcraft practitioners not use the word pagan. Alternatively those religions that I listed could use European polytheism or another alternative

I do see timeless truths in the Bible that Atheists put up blinders to just because they simply hate religion. See (Cornona) disease vs the virtue of being chaste. I would agree with atheists that the Bible is not a scientific book however. People in history were pretty much just as intelligent as we are with a different vocabulary for saying the same things we say. Chastity and cleanliness together talked about disease. Sadly stoning was their way to quarantine. 

This gets to the TRUTH part of the Bible which is at its core a self help book based on the (psuedo) history of a religious group in a mostly positive psychological way. Many Proverbs, Psalms ect are universally true. A broken heart and a contrite spirit are the only things you can give when you do something horrible to possibly be forgiven emotionally (spiritually) by others.

The Bible was not written by scientists. Science does not refute life comes from life however. Science also believes we could be decendents of aliens from the dinosaur apocalypse meteor dna. Created from crater *dust* (that seemed to appear from nothing). Mankind was created by God vs mankind was created by asteroid dna are the same sentences to me only in different time periods said by different people trying to say the same thing. Life comes from life. An atheist calling our ancestors aliens versus theists God(s) are very hair splitting especially when Mormonism just goes there saying God is just an alien (from Kolob).

religion,Does religious freedom really exist in the US?,"Yeah, its enshrined in the constitution, and has always been there, but do Americans really have the right to choose their own religion? Even ignoring the fact that non-Christians often face discrimination, most religions require you to find another person to convert. I live in the deep south, and everyone around here is some form of fundamentalist Christian with few exceptions. Southern Baptists are clearly the majority here (churches that aren't associated with Southern Baptist are hard to find, even though churches seem to be everywhere). I've heard there's a few Wiccans in the community, but they have to remain in hiding due to the local culture. 

Thinking about my lack of religion, and my desire to be religious again, I really don't think I have much of a choice here. I wouldn't be able to find anyone to assist me in just about any conversion process, and even if I did I would face ostracism from the local community. I've never even come out as an agnostic to anyone, even my own family. I don't even know what would happen to me if I belonged to a non-Christian religion. This community is overrun with Trump supporters, and there's also quite a word of faith presence here who apparently have this museum here that they use to 'educate' converts on their loony idea of the holocaust. I don't know what it is they teach in that place, since I've never seen it open (supposedly they just unlock the door for converts as they come). I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if they were teaching anti-semitic conspiracy theories in that place. Yeah, I live in a lovely community. I even seriously know an alt-righter here who claims to be Jewish (though his beliefs don't line up with any version of Judaism I've heard of, he claims to be a Samaritan, but he describes his beliefs as being 'intermediate between Judaism and Seventh-day Adventist', he's also a real sucker for any sort of nutty conspiracy theory out there, I regularly question if he beliefs anything that's actually true, yeah, a real Bobby Fisher character he is, minus the being smart part anyway). 

I really don't believe I have freedom of religion where I live, and my town isn't exactly unusual for the deep south; the state government aligns perfectly with the local views, even though we live pretty far from the state capital. 

Yeah, freedom of religion may be enshrined in the pseudo-holy constitution, but its not reliably enforced and if you want to convert to a non-Christian religion around here, you'd have a hard time finding anyway. In all seriousness, I don't think there's a religious center (like a temple or whatnot) to a non-Christian religion within hundreds of miles of me (unless maybe you count the local Jehovah's Witnesses and Word of Faith as being non-Christian). Freedom of religion here, honestly, is little more than words on paper. For all practical purposes, those words may as well not even be in the constitution. I'd argue that freedom of religion doesn't truly exist in the US, especially these days. I'd still like to here other opinions on this. I'm not some arrogant alt-righter that avoids debate; if I am wrong, I am willing to admit it. I am willing to face counter-evidence, rather than living in denial that such exists.

religion,We are doomed.,"Before going into details, I would like to give some background. I’m 31 years old, I was born in Ukraine and 3 years ago I moved to US. Since I was a kid I always believed in God. At the beginning I would go only to Orthodox Churches, but in my 20s I moved to another city, and started going to Catholic Churches. Right now it’s hard to tell why exactly I preferred Catholicism, but something about Catholic sermons made me feel connected to God in a way I could never feel in Orthodox Churches. 

I prayed 3-4 times every day, and at least couple of times I witnessed how God actually helped me. I know it’s Him, because there’s just no other explanation. For example: I had been fired from the company I loved, was desperate, and after 2 months of struggling I was re-hired by the same manager who fired me. After that I spent about 3 years working at that company and became pretty close friends with that manager. At some point I asked him what made him to change his mind. At first he was a bit hesitant, but then he told me an amazing story: after firing me he started having a recurring dream almost every night, to the point that he didn’t want to go to sleep because he knew what exactly was going to happen. Every night the dream was different in the form, but the idea was exactly the same: different people would treat him very unfairly, sometimes even to the point of him being killed. It took him couple of months to realize what was going on, and after I was re-hired, he said he never had this dream again. Never.

Of course this only increased my Faith in God. At some point I became so close to God, that I didn’t need to go Churches any more, I didn’t need an intermediary between me and Him. For me there was no longer the difference between Catholic and Orthodox God: it’s The God, people just have different rituals associated with worshipping Him and interpreted the Original Message in different ways, which over 2 thousand years resulted in multiple churches and denominations.

And then another interesting thing happened: I got an urge to read the Quran. At the beginning I was very reluctant, I was scary that it would affect my Faith. I also wanted to understand what it was about, not just read it. So after couple of months I decided to take small steps: one page per day with super intensive self introspection on my feelings after the reading. And again I realized the same thing: it is the same God. Yes, the rituals and certain interpretations are different. But it’s not God’s fault, it’s we as people misunderstood and changed the Original Message.

Everything suddenly started making sense. There’s one God, we've just been worshipping Him in different ways. And the worst of all, imagine how many people were killed throughout our history because we couldn’t understand it. We kept fighting in the name of different Gods without realizing, that there are no different Gods. This made me so sick of humanity. We were told to love each other, and yet we kept killing and murdering and slaughtering each other.

The more I thought about it, the more questions I had in mind. Who will explain it to us? Will we be able to understand it? People seem to be so stubborn in what they believe and absolutely not willing to see outside the box. Clearly the books we read have been written in a way to maximize the power certain people have: why would God need one group of people to kill another group of people? It’s just us, people, fighting for power.

So this was just a background, and now I am going to tell you what happened recently.

Sometimes I spend weekends in remote places, where I mostly read, pray and reconnect with God. And this is what happened about a month ago during one such retreat. I was praying, sometimes I lose the sense of time, but I think at that point I spent about 2 hours. And something extraordinary happened. Something I didn’t expect as praying is one of the most natural activities for me and it had never happened before. I’ve got a message from God. It wasn’t me hearing His voice, or seeing Him. It was like for about a couple of minutes (although it’s hard to be sure, time felt very weird) I left my body and instead became a pure experience. I don’t know what exactly happened or where exactly I was. 

But I know the Message that was delivered to me: We Are Doomed. Similarly to how God already destroyed humanity in the Great Flood, it is going to happen again. Have you heard about Global Warming? This is it. We Are Doomed. 

To say that I was stunned is to say nothing. It took me a month to process it and to understand what happened. At first I didn’t believe it was actually a message from God, but now I have no doubts. We know that sometimes God talks to some of us. I was blessed to be one of those people.

We did have a chance, God gave us a chance, but we were too ignorant and too involved into arguing and fighting with each other to understand what is about to happen.

religion,Trying to understand Jesus in Islam," 

Hi everyone,

I have been struggling to understand the Islamic point of view on Jesus Christ as this is an area I've always been interested in getting a good understanding about.

What I do understand about the Islamic belief on Jesus Christ is:

1. Jesus is not the son of Allah but was a 'simply' a human prophet bringing the Gospel revelation from Allah.
2. Jesus was miraculously born from the Virgin Mary.
3. Jesus has been recorded to be the only 'absolutely sinless' prophet.
4. Jesus will come again according to the book of revelation to defeat the antichrist.

What I do not understand about the Islamic belief on Jesus Christ is:

1. Jesus performed miracles like no other prophet of Allah, giving sight to the blind, healing lepers, raising the dead, and breathing life into clay birds. --- Raising the dead was a little suspect for me, how can a human prophet be able to raise people from the dead except for the messiah?
2. Being born miraculous from the Virgjn Mary and being the only human being to be born of a Virgin woman seems to be great evidence that Jesus is the messiah.
3. Why is Jesus coming back to defeat the antichrist and not the prophet Mohammad?
4. Jesus being recorded as an 'absolutely sinless' prophet which is impossible for any human being including all other prophets. --- if he was the only absolutely sinless being, doesn't this mean he is of divine nature and is evidence for him being the messiah?
5. Jesus' name is mentioned 97 times in the Quran and is given honorary titles such as 'the messiah' (surah 4;171:5:72), ""the spirit of God"" and ""the word of God"" (surah 4:169-171). He is considered ""a sign unto men"" and ""mercy from God"" (surah 19:34) as well as ""the speech of truth"" (surah 19:34). --- Yet Muslims strongly believe that Jesus is not the messiah - why is that?
6. Jesus was not crucified ""for so it appeared to them that they crucified him"" --- However, muslims bilieve that Jesus was 'taken up to heaven' - does this not indicate that he is the Messiah still?

Forgive me if this seems like I am attacking the islamic religion because I am not.

I am simply trying to grasp a good understanding of Jesus Christ in Islam. That is all.

Thank you for your patience and love.",1595286933.0
religion,Religion just humans way to explain what they don't understand?,"The other day I came across an interesting thought. I was thinking about ancient civilizations and their culture and gods. I was thinking that the gods of before were just ways for humans to answer certain questions we had in the past. Why does it rain? ""There is a god that is crying."" or ""There is a god that is rewarding us and giving life to our crops."" In the past we did not know about the water cycle and the way and reason why rain forms. So in order to explain this phenomenon we created a god. So I got to thinking, well when does it change? When did we go from believing gods controlled everything about the natural world to the religions of today? And then it hit me that maybe it hasn't completely changed. What if religion right now is just us humans trying to come up to an explanation to a phenomenon that we don't understand. Like our ancestors in trying to explain why it rains, we are now trying to explain what happens when we die among some other major questions. Such as why do we exist? What is our purpose? Why should I be good? Etc.. I don't think we ever will come up with a definite answer to these questions. This is why I believe religion will continue to exist throughout human history in some shape or form.

religion,I think the ship of Theseus and the teletransportation paradox prove that an afterlife is impossible and thus mainstream gods cannot exist,"This is not a simple argument, so think and read thoroughly before attempting a simple answer. These thought experiments were provided by people with a deep understanding of Philosophy, so try not to dismiss them as arguments from the simpleton that writes this post.

Let's start with the teletransportation paradox. Feel free to read the description from Wikipedia, but I prefer a slightly different rendition:

Imagine a teletransporter, a machine that breaks you down into atoms and zips them to Mars, where they are reconstructed. You have a friend that makes such travels to and from Mars all the time. You are able to recognize him after every such travel: the same appearance, same memories (and new ones from Mars), same personality and so on. **Is this your friend every time you meet him after a trip?** One day, you have an opportunity to work at the teletransportation company and actually provide the trip to interplanetary travellers. The supervisor explains that sometimes accidents happen in the reconstruction, so they need to take security measures. It turns out that the first teletransportation customer you will serve is your friend. He steps into the machine and is put to sleep. The machine is turned on, and after a few minutes you hear his voice confirming that he is on Mars. They give a lethal injection to his body on Earth and send him to a recycling plant. **Is the person on Mars your friend?** Has your friend died in front of you and the person on Mars is someone else?

Now consider the ship of Theseus. Again, feel free to read from Wikipedia or another source. Again, I like an alternative rendition that simplifies and highlights some aspects:

The ship of Theseus, departs from Athens on a long and difficult journey. During this journey, it makes several stops to replace parts that were damaged and get new crew to replace people as they retire or quit. Many years later, the ship returns to Athens, having all of its parts and crew replaced. If someone were to go through every port where the ship stopped, collected all of the original parts of the ship, restored them and put together its original form, which of the ships is the ship of Theseus?

&amp;#x200B;

My main argument is: if you answer that no, the person on Mars is not your friend, it is not logical to believe that you will experience an afterlife. Therefore, any god that is truthful and promises an afterlife cannot logically exist. There are premises on which this conclusion hinges, and next I develop that rationale. Right off the bat, I would like to avoid one counter-argument which I find silly: I assume that one should seek to believe that which is logical; the illogical has no predictive power by definition and thus should not be believed. I take that as a given.

Both thought experiments exercise the concept of identity and how the point of view for determining identity matters. Let's start with the ship from Theseus: if the question is asked to someone who stayed in Theseus, that person will identify the ship from the **identifying features** of the ship they knew when the ship left the first port; they will **not** identify the modified ship as the one that left, but instead the restored one. Should the question be asked to someone who followed the ship's **journey**, they will identify the modified ship as the ship from Theseus and the restored one as a **copy of the initial state** of the ship.

The same can be seen in the teletransportation paradox. When we first try to identify our friend, we look for **identifying features** between trips (looks, memories, personality traits). But when we are able to follow their **journey** to Mars, none of that matters and you see your friend die. Likewise, ""your friend"" on Mars remembers falling asleep on Earth and waking up on Mars; he **did not experience the journey**, therefore he must try and identify **himself** through identifying features. *So whether or not somebody identifies himself after an unconscious journey does not warrant the persistence of identity*.

As you might predict, the argument is that **the persistence of identifying features do not determine identity**. The only fact that determines identity is the **continuity of experience**. Some people say that this is actually arguing against the very existence of identity, and I'd say it's like arguing that physical movement is a series of teletransportations.

A third proof of this is our own history. I am almost 40 years old now. If you take a picture of me when I was 20, you will see a different person. Sure, that photo will look like me, but that is not a picture of me. That person did not have my beliefs, my knowledge, my memories (only part of them), my personality, would not make the same choices, and doesn't even have the exact same appearance. What I am changed, but *we know that 20-year-old Henrique turned into 40-year-old Henrique because there is a continuous line of experiences that connects the two of us*. If that line is interrupted, say, by a teletransportation, even if my initial self is destroyed before I ""wake up"" somewhere else, there is a complete discontinuity in experience and a new identity is created.

The problem for the person that initially believes that there is an afterlife is that, if you think your friend died in the teletransportation machine and the person on Mars is not him, you must also conclude that when you die on Earth and ""wake up"" in the afterlife, **that is not going to be you**. That will be someone else who thinks they are you. Even if heaven exists, *you* are not going to experience that. If hell exists, somebody else will be sent there to suffer forever. Even if heaven and hell are real, *you* are not going to either.

I can already hear the screech: *but I have an indivisible, uncopiable, immaterial* ***soul***. I will grant you that this entire argument starts from ignorance of the existence of a soul. Let's agree on this: if there is such an immaterial **identifying feature** that cannot be copied, then an afterlife is possible. But I think that has been thoroughly disproved by neuroscience and the history of theology. We can talk about those here too. But if you wish to discuss whether a soul exists or not, how about we also agree on this: if there is no such thing as a soul, then there is not a god that is truthful and promises an afterlife (heaven, hell, reincarnation...). Deal?

tl;dr: as a proposition

* P1: identity requires continuity of experience
* P2: death is an interruption of experience
* Conclusion: an afterlife does not preserve identity; therefore, it is impossible to go to heaven or hell

Conclusion is incorrect if and only if one can positively demonstrate that a literal soul exists independent of the brain and is able to experience stimuli (like the body and brain do) even in the absence of the body, is unique to a person, cannot be duplicated, and is or contains a set of identifying features.",1590520815.0

religion,"The Mad Dog, Angel of Science","The Old Governor sat on his throne with four angels in his court; Cupid’s Teeth for they deserve mention of honor, Sleepless the Dog that Never Sleeps, The Renegade and The Mad Dog.

The Four Dogs would constantly challenge one another for the chance to be Governor. But one angel was triumphant every time. The blood spilled amongst angels is unlike anything a mortal should witness. Their sharp long claws and their alabaster fur, standing on two feet like human mortals, their long floppy ears making them so adorable and sweet to disservice the recollection of their wrath.

The Mad Dog came before me in a forest as green as emerald. At 45° was Sleepless the Dog that never Sleeps and he planned to kill the Mad Dog, he tried to swing his claws at the him. But The Mad Dog pulled in his arm so he may rip out his spine and peel his fur from the angelic body. And the Mad Dog folded the blood soaked pelt and placed it on the floor. On the dead angel’s body I saw a war that has lasted a thousand years upon his forehead.

At 135° was Cupid’s Teeth for they deserved mention of honor and he planned to eat the Mad Dog. He lunged at the Mad Dog drawing blood from his arm. He used this to his advantage to tear off his pelt separating his dog lips from his skull. Cupid’s Teeth was no more. The Mad Dog folded his blood soaked pelt on top of the last. On the forehead of the angel’s body was famine and I could see 1/3 of the world starving.

At 270° was The Renegade and he planned to rip the spine out of the Mad Dog. But The Mad Dog was quicker. From the forehead of the angel’s body I saw death of humanity ever climbing because of man’s failures. He took his blood soaked pelt and folded it on top of the last.

And the three pelts were soaked in angelic blood so much so that there was no longer evidence of white. And The Mad Dog picked up the crimson pelts and they became one and a small part of the forest died behind him. I could hear an angel from above say, Behold, The Great Filter the instrument that simulates extinction, and challenge and progress. And The Mad Dog wore the Great Filter as a cape.

And I looked down and saw that Cupid’s Teeth that had fallen out had become gold. The teeth had come together, with seven adorned chromatic jewels, and taken the form of a Crown. An the angel said, Behold this crown of Cupid’s Teeth, may it radiate magnificence forever and ever! And the Mad Dog wore the crown, he truly took the form of an angel I’d never heard of The Old Governor.

Behind the Old Governor where the trees had died had become a path. And he looked at me to acknowledge that I was there. He waved his paw and gestured me to follow. Through the clearing was a glorious city that had not been built yet. And the angel above said, Behold Eavangaea the divine city forged by mortal men!

And The Old Governor opened his mouth to unleash a roar loud enough to deafen all humanity and yet you could still hear the angels above say :

Build a city for humanity to stand tall. Let them have the strength to take down civilization and construct a new from the old.

Humanity picked up their tools. Let us be the Builders! We will build a city. Let it be called Eavangaea.

Let them build the Sentralia. Let them build their Megalopolis. Let them live in this city of 40 towers.

Let the Builders who defend the Builders be the Sleepless. For they shall not sleep until the city is built.

When the last Stone has been lain. When every Builder has a home in Eavangaea. Let them be called Governor. Let them have the ability of Builders and Sleepless and the power to govern their own city.

Let them choose twelve to be Entrociter. Let them process the will and work of the Governors and the Builders.

Let the Governors share their food, and their resources, and their water, and their tools

Let the land outside the city be nature replenished and the earth be a garden again.

And let it be known that those that build the Sentralia and the Wimbledon and Eavangaea may not be touched by the powers of the Great Filter for they have leveled up in human progression.

In the video it says that DNA couldn't create itself comparing it to a physical book .

So essentially it goes to where did the ""first atom"" came from if there wasn't a creator . There are 2 things I could do try to explain that or say I don't know .
If I say I don't know then he/she would say that ""Then there must be a creator"" and I asked ""But where did God came from ?"" he/she told me ""we don't know"" ... So what makes her/his theory correct and mine wrong ? 

  I have seen that whenever I talked to anyone religion (and I ask questions that makes you doubt) they get very offended and I seen this effect in another group of people ... The flat earthers , their reactions were very similar !
  I think this happens when someone has insecurities about their belief (even if they don't realize it) and they are very closed about other ideas and when you give them a new one they get easily offended

  I lived in a very religious orthodox family (my grandfather was a priest and I lived with my grandparents for 16 years)

I loved and still love science so much (especially physics and biology)

 This religion disapproved evolutionism , they think that humans were created like how they are now which makes no sense ! They disapprove the fact that there were more species of humans even if given proof (images of the skulls of humans form other species) . 

  The worst thing I heard about religion is ""You don't have to think religion , you need to have belief in religion"" (of course not in english) which makes it so suspicious like someone is trying to cover up a lie ...

  There a creator might exsist ... But I don't think this religion is correct about it 

 Other facts : 

Noah's Ark : Noah build a boat that holded a pair from every species of animals ? 2 african elephants can weigh over 12 tons and he built a boat that out of wood that can hold them ?

Non-evolutionism : It is obvious that we evloved because we have weak spine , knees and ankles which show that we used to use our arms to walk (our weight being distributed to the arms and legs)

Sexism: I read a very old Bible (it was checked by my grandfather) in wich said that Eva eated from a tree they weren't supposed to and she made Adam eat from the tree too , God was angry then and he told her that she would have to serve men and that births will be painful..(This probably is not in every Bible but seeing this in a approved Bible is horrible)

Women can't enter the church while on their period

Women can't enter the altar ever

Jesus was a male , all of his apostoles were males , god is represented as a male and the only important woman St.Maria she was the mother of Jesus and that's mostly it , most of the important characters in the Bible are males.

People always say I'm Christian because I say I believe that Jesus Christ was real and that he died on the cross for us, but I don't think that necessarily makes me a believer.

When I don't try to do good things and don't go to church and subscribe to Christianity regularly, I find it hard to connect with people at church, and I can't easily meet people anywhere else because of how rural it is, and anyone else I meet outside of church I tend to not understand and don't seem to share the values I want to establish within myself, like charity, avoiding hedonism, avoiding gossip.

I always end up kind of being an odd-one out at any job I go to, and usually get fired. Most people I meet at work have girlfriends or wives, or kids, or like to go to the bar, or gossip about the job, and I don't. Whenever it comes to the topic of sex, I either get called out for never having sex and never being in a relationship, or called out for my sexual vices and hangups, like pornography, and masturbation.

I just want to find positive people who want to do good in the world, but the only place I can seem to find people like that around here is at church.

religion,Is Jesus a Megalomaniac?,"I've recently had some debates about religion, primarily Christianity but all other religions that look up to Jesus still apply the same principle. First, why do you need to ""accept"" Jesus in order to be let into heaven? Even if your personal morals line up with that of the religion in question and you do not ""sin"" and do not commit crimes and are genuinely kind and generous and caring to all living things, why would Jesus deny you access to heaven after all that just because you won't accept him? And why would someone that lived the opposite, did many terrible things in their lives but near the end atoned for all the bad things you did, and accepted Jesus you would be let into heaven. Why is accepting Jesus a requirement? 

That's the part that seems like megalomania or just being an attention whore. I could just imagine that conversation
 ""You lived a wonderful life, you were kind to everyone, were generous, helped those in need buuuut... You didn't get on your knees and bow before me so, off to hell to you!"" That sounds like a level of psychopath beyond even Hitler, to me. Mainstream religions that follow this ideology would be the same people that believe that people of their religion are automatically above everyone else, not even morally. Just simply, better. Because that is their version of Jesus and of religion, and that just seems like a very ignorant thing to be following and encouraging. Megalomaniac Jesus. 


Now, that sums up my point, and what I wrote this for. But I'd like to also share a bit more, in preparation for the conversations that follow.


Yes, I am atheist, I find the whole idea of religion rather ridiculous and frankly care little for it. I prefer the idea of being a good person just to be a good person, and not needing a religion to make me act that way just so I can get into heaven (Which is hypocrisy, you're acting nice for self gain). And I'd like to think that I am a good person. I am too much of a realist and cannot bring myself to believe in an afterlife, even though I would very much like to believe there is, because living forever even in a different state of being sounds so much better than just simply dying and ceasing existence. But I can't bring myself to believe in that, and I can't live my life based off of the belief that there is more, then end up being wrong and wasting this one chance that I have to be alive.  However, if I am wrong, and it turns out there is an afterlife or more chances or whatever there is, I'd personally like to believe that whatever God is out there would let people be apart of that afterlife regardless of if they believed in him/her or not. And judge them based off of what they did in life and not off of who could kiss ass the most.

I'm not here to argue. This is what I believe, and frankly I don't think my mind can really be changed. But I am interested in people's thoughts and opinions on it, including religious people that stand by this version of Jesus, religious people that are of a different religion that isn't like that, and with other atheists if any.

Hello Brothers,

This question is turning me in to an insomniac. This is perplexing my peaceful mind. Please help me.

**Why Men produce a lot of (250M) sperms in sex while just 1 sperm is enough for reproduction/conceiving.** Why would God design our body in a way that we waste Sperms when religion says every sperm is sacred and contains life and it should not be wasted and any such action is a sin example masturbation. Could it be a characteristic passed down to us by human evolution like atheists say about this?.

And the second question is; i believe all religions especially Abrahamic religions consider same-sex marriage as blasphemous. I used to believe a man is gay when he chooses to be a gay - but after reading their stories i am convinced its their body hormone conditions which make them feel attracted to same sex.

If a god is all knowing, then he knows everything that will every happen in the world for the rest of eternity. When god creates humans he gives them their personality, looks, tendencies, etc.  With each decision he makes while creating a human, he knows all the future implications that trait will have. When all the “traits” are added to the final mix, he should automatically know what all of these traits will eventually lead to the person doing for their whole life (if you believe god is omniscient, which I do). 

If god knows everything that will happen throughout a human’s life, and he is also the creator of that human, then there is no such thing as free will.

religion,How Christianity Christianity Morphed from a Philosophy of Nonviolence to a Religion for Militarized States,"For the first 300 years of its existence, Christianity was an anti-war cult. It was so against violence of any kind that they became a major thorn in Rome's side as they even began to actively recruit Roman soldiers so that they'd drop out of the military force. This, not early Christians' devotion to Christ, was the major reason why Rome persecuted them so harshly. They were to be made an example: participate in our militarized state, or die a gruesome death.

The shift away from the roots of Jesus philosophy of nonviolence (IN ALL FORMS) began with Emperor Constantine's conversion and use of Christianity to solidify power. Once the religion began to merge with the government, the faith was perverted into something utterly unrecognizable to the first Christians.

""Nonviolence"" by Mark Kurlansky provides a fascinating look at how Christianity drifted from its early pacifist roots to becoming an instrument used by militaristic nations to subjugate and oppress ""enemies"" of the state:

“If someone were to come along who would not compromise, a rebel who insisted on taking the only moral path, rejecting violence in all its forms, such a person would seem so menacing that he would be killed, and after his death he would be canonized or deified, because a saint is less dangerous than a rebel. This has happened numerous times, but the first prominent example was a Jew named Jesus.”

\---

“Jesus was seen as dangerous because he rejected not only warfare and killing but any kind of force. Those in authority saw this as a challenge. How could there be authority without force?”

\---

“One of history's greatest lessons is that once the state embraces a religion, the nature of that religion changes radically. It loses its nonviolent component and becomes a force for war rather than peace. The state must make war, because without war it would have to drop its power politics and renege on its mission to seek advantage over other nations, enhancing itself at the expense of others. And so a religion that is in the service of a state is a religion that not only accepts war but prays for victory. From Constantine to the Crusaders to the contemporary American Christian right, people who call themselves Christians have betrayed the teachings of Jesus while using His name in the pursuit of political power.

\---

“Then in the fifth century an Algerian bishop, Augustine of Hippo, wrote the enduring apologia for murder on the battlefield, the concept of “just war.” Augustine, considered one of the fathers of the Catholic Church, declared that the validity of war was a question of inner motive. If a pious man believed in a just cause and truly loved his enemies, it was permissible to go to war and to kill the enemies he loved because he was doing it in a high-minded way.”",1600800812.0

religion,What is the Scientific Proof of God??," 

First, I think I should point out the characteristics of God.

1. God is everywhere.
2. God is present in every Anu (atom in Hindi).
3. He or She was never created
4. He or She will never be destroyed.
5. In Hinduism, God is actually not the creator, but He(I am going to use the pronoun 'he' because I'm getting tired of writing everywhere 'he or she'.) is actually the Substance or the thing(I cannot find the right word to put here, I hope you understand) out of which the World is created.

Now, coming to Science,

1. Energy is present everywhere, in every point of space.
2. Matter is created out of Energy; Atoms are made out of Energy. (E=MC\^2)
3. Energy is never created.
4. Energy is not destroyed.
5. (For the authenticity of he above points, refer to the first law of thermodynamics, which is ΔQ= ΔV+ ΔW.)
6. I already proved in the other point that Matter is created out of Energy, so the whole World was actually created out of Heat energy.( Refer to Big Bang and the creation of matter by Heat Energy)

religion,Why are you so sure about that you are right? (Rant),"I am an atheist. For me the process of becoming an atheist was quite simple. I live in a very multicultural society. When I was young i realized that my friends believe in another religion than me and are the same convinced as I was. Sa I took a step back and realized we all believed cause we where born into that particular religion. So my next step was to try to research all the religions, so i reserached wikipedia. On wikipedia there is a list of all the religions out there. At this point I didnt realize that there are probably thousands more religion which are not there and which are already distinct.

Since I was convinced that there must be a god and something must have caused it I tried to exclude the religions that made the least sense to me. Like starting with greek or roman mythology, which seemed to me just like explanaitions of natural experiences. 

After some time I just realized one problem, you can not make such a distinction you can not say this story makes more sense than the other, since they all build up on miracles. (besides maybe buddhism)

For me it doesnt make sense to say polytheism is less logical than monotheism, because it would require me to judge the fundamentals of reality, for which I am not equipped. How am I supposed to know anything about that, whithout any clear and obvuous interaction? Believers will say that if there were such an interaction I wouldnt have the free will to not believe, but i would believe if i would know which god! That is the thing i can not differantiate between the religions in no way in any meaningful way.

So how was i supposed to know which religion is right? They all did not make sense to me, in no way it made sense to me why a religion should be based in such a great way on where you were born and still i see people so convinced that they cant be wrong about their religion. Cause it makes the most sense for them. But couldnt I come up with a totally logical religion in just one second whithout flaws?:Like god created the world, people and animals and he did not interact with anything ever since, but he demands worship in this particular way and no other written down in a book. Everyone else go to hell.

This religion would make sense, doesnt have any flaws and still wouldnt be right.

In the end i realized it would be impossible to decide between all the religions and since most religions wouldnt send me to hell for not believing in it, i decided i have to decide between Christianity and Islam. 

The thing is i simply can not accept the concept of hell in any way. I simply can not! I also can not understand that anyone could worship a beeing that would let anyone be tortured forever. (Believers would maybe say god doesnt actively torture me, but it is his nonpresent, that will torture me. But what I dont understand is, that he obviously has the power to end this, but he chooses not to do it, which is also infinitly immoral in my opinion)

I would say I would worship a god that would make himself clear to me! A god that would explain to me how a concept of infinite torture can ever be moral in anyway. But I just see to many mistakes in all those concepts and books.

None of them makes any logical sense to me! None! ANd the thing is even if they would make sense like buddhism (maybe) I still wouldnt know if it were true.

How can anyone expect anyone in this world to pick and choose the right religion and still people walk around here and tell other that their religion is right and that they can not be wrong!

Are they really saying everyone in other religions are just too dumb to understand it or too ignorant, do they realize that they were most likely born into that religion and would have choosen the right religion out of cheer luck? 

How can this system be fair in any way?

In my opinion, if god exist, the system is not fair!

But and now I will write why i am struggeling and why I am writting this:

I am an very open minded person and I know I am not very intelligent. Really I am dumb! 

And I am scared because I was often shown to be wrong in things and so may people, very intelligent people believe and they try to persuade you and give their arguments and at first glance they might make sense to me but then they dont.

It really scares me that I as a dumb human beeing could be wrong about all of this and when I will die I will shown where my flaws were and I would have to live with that the whole eternity.

I am simply not bright enough to make any fundamental jugements about the fundamentals of reality and I know stupid people that believe in religions and bright people. How should i decide which bright people are right and which are wrong? Even if I would find out that Islam, for example is true, how can I ever do something that is so against my moral intuition (which might be flawed as well). 

My moral intuition, my sense of what is right and wrong, my sense that something like torture or like slavery is something that a good god could never justify, how can I ever make sense of that?

I don’t know if you exist or not, but I were to bet on it, I would say you don’t I feel like its too easy to just say that you do and that Christianity is the truth and that everyone who disagrees with it is wrong. I don’t think that a prophet from 2000 years ago talked about in a book that is even older holds THE truths and mysteries of life. It takes out all the fun of life knowing where we are going and where we came from, and the meaning of life. The world is too complex and huge, there is no way that the ultimate truth is held by 1/7 of a species in the last 2000 years on a planet with millions of species that have come and gone, in one of thousands of galaxies each with billions of stars and planets. Out of all of those places you chose us? Why? What makes us so special and unique to be graced with true knowledge and an afterlife? For Christianity as with other religions, its followers believe that their religion is the true one and they willing to bet their life on it. How do they know that they are not living in the same lies as they say the others are? I don’t mean to just talk shit about Christianity. I talk about the idea of religion and divinity in all its forms. I used to think that even though religion is not true, it has an intrinsic value to our society as it teaches values that I firmly believe ibn such as: Love, Empathy, charity and doing no harm. However, there is a hint of hypocrisy in all of that. The bible says all those beautiful things to its followers, and like I said, I agree with most of what the bible says (except for a few things: I support homosexuality, premarital sex, and other things). The problem is that those teachings are to be followed so that we can have a place to go when our time here is done. It takes away the selflessness of being nice and charitable as it will ultimately serve a personal and selfish goal. Doing good around us is without value if it serves such a purpose. It should be done because it is the right thing to do, not because it is the will of God or because we want to go to heaven. I understand the appeal of religion, being born into a religion, having a family and entourage that believes in the same things you do. It is very comforting to know that any hardship you face is just a “test” and that “God Willing” everything will be fine. The God Willing or “Incha Allah” (in Arabic), for me raises a logical fallacy. People say it when they hope for something that they know is not guaranteed. Imagine if someone close to me got very ill, I would ask you to help them. If the person got better I would thank you and say that what happened was your plan and you always kept an eye on him, however, if the person did not get better I would turn to the doctor or the illness to blame them, and say that this hardship was caused by the imperfections of our world and the wrongdoings of humans. This is the problem we only attribute the good things to you and blame the world for problems and hardship. An analogy to show what is really wrong with this way of thinking, is to imagine a pool (our world) and a lifeguard (God or any divinity). If I were to drown, I would ask the lifeguard for help (this is the equivalent of praying when in despair). If the lifeguard saves me from drowning, I would thank him as he answered my call. If I were to drown without him helping me, I would blame the pool or my swimming abilities, even though the “lifeguard” heard my “calls” he still actively chose not to help. God if you are our savior and if really do help some people who are in need of your help then you are a good and fair god, however, if like the lifeguard  you watch people drown and willingly do nothing about it then you are a god that is not fair. As you chose to ignore some cries for help, and answer to others regardless of merit and need. Christians and other monotheistic religion believe in a God that is fair, since you are not, therefore I cannot believe in your existence.

You don't choose to not believe in a creator of the universe, you just naturally don't. You may not have nearly all the answers, but may believe every single thing in our universe is just based on the laws of physics, such as action and reaction. 

Classical physics to our PERCEPTION is accurate. Beyond our perception, when you really try to learn about time, quantum physics, the way the universe works, you learn classical physics isn't the ""truth"" of what our universe is.  We can learn facts about the reality, but we certainly can't in full visualize and conceptualize it completely with our brains. Kind of like trying to understand greater dimensions. You can learn facts, see digitalized simulations (which isn't showing what it really is), but you can't truly grasp the concept. Our evidence for many theories, especially the deeper you dig, really is stuff we can't completely understand due to the limits of what our brains can relate too. 

The more you try to understand the reality of the universe, the more you realize believing in our scientific knowledge requires just as much faith as believing in God. 

The food for thought is to try to help you be more open minded about the fact that believing in God based on faith shouldn't be impossible. Because the reality you believe in, should also seem impossible to u. All we truly have is faith.",1580143518.0

religion,Saying gods are interpretated differently so don't exist is like saying stars are interpreted differently so don't exist.,"A common reason I see people give for atheism (one of several of course) is that different gods don't match. I was inspired to touch on this when someone raised Christian said they didn't really realize people believed in other gods until they met a Muslim. This shook their faith. And as most only focus on literal, strict interpretations of monotheistic religions, that's enough for some to align themselves with ""no theism"".

Ignoring for now that rejecting all gods based on one or two interpretations is far from reasonable, I want to look at the fact that if we are even slightly less literal, its obvious that gods correspond across time. With Allah and Jehovah for instance, you have basically the same God, just little different cultural tidbits (like which son to follow). But in the end you have 3 religions (judaism the 3rd) with a single, controlling God in charge of everything, demanding certain forms of worship, etc and so on. It may be easier to go back to polytheism to see this, such as how Seth was Ba'al, Tehuti was Hermes, and so many more. 

Really it's not hard to understand something can objectively exist and be interpretated differently by cultures. An example I like, because it covers all history, is the stars. Some cultures share constellations, some are vastly different. Surely this wouldn't shock anyone to the point of saying there are, in fact, no stars! Government style, weather, local geography, relationships with neighbors- all play a role in our interpretation of the world. To think Gods, if they exist, must be the one exception to this is special pleading.

**Edit: if stars don't work for you feel free to use Love.** I jjust like stars .

We have been taught (at least in the us) that Greek myths and their corresponding stories are just that. Myths. There really wasn't a god of the sea or a women who bit the heads off her kids just so her husband wouldn't kill them. That's  what we are taught at a young age to believe so why believe the exact opposite about Christianity?
  i mean yes the stories from the Bible  are less intense then  the Greeks (greek myths defiantly have the better stories) and they get one maybe 2 gods (idk if Jesus is more of a god or a cult leader but same thing)  instead of the 10+ the Greeks get. But if you look at the two there very similar in the case that they are both belief systems and stories to help people.  people to this day still Verry much believe in both the Christian god and the Greek gods.

religion,Islam could be proven true if Saudi Arabia allowed scientist to analyse the black stone in the Kaaba. So why hasn’t this happened?,"
If you don’t know, in Mecca at the Kaaba there is a [black stone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/The_Blackstone.jpg) somewhere on the exterior of the cube. During hajj and umrah Muslims go round the Kaaba and aim to kiss the black stone in order to remove all their sins.

Now, the interesting thing. This Hadith

It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: **The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ”The Black Stone came down from Paradise.”**

(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; al-Nasaa’i, 2935. **The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi).** which means it’s a legit Hadith and most Muslims accept this to be absolute FACT!

**”The Stone was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black.**

Now... I’m sure archaeologists and scientists could put a piece of the stone under a scope or whatever it is they do when investigating rocks. They could then determine:

1) what kind of stone it is and it’s origin (there shouldn’t be any stone like it if it’s from paradise right?)

2) what exactly caused the colour to change (regular erosion or unexplained) 

So why won’t Muslims in Saudi allow this to happen? Apparently this has been tried but the guardians of the Kaaba refuse to allow any scientific experimentation on it. 

I mean, it’s already broken into pieces so why not let all the scientist in the world examine a tiny chunk of a small piece of Kaaba black stone?",1583535424.0
religion,Evidence that suggests that the Quran may be man-made.,"I'd like to preface this post with: I do not mean to offend anybody, this is simply an observation that I have made. I have no ill-intention toward Islam, nor Judaism. I study comparative religion as a hobby and I noticed this earlier today.

In Surah Al-Ma'idah, verse 32, (5:32), you will find the quote in Arabic, which we then translate to English:

&gt; مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ أَنَّهُۥ مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًۢا   
&gt;  
&gt; بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعًا   
&gt;  
&gt; وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَآ أَحْيَا ٱلنَّاسَ جَمِيعًا ۚ وَلَقَدْ جَآءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا   
&gt;  
&gt; بِٱلْبَيِّنَٰتِ ثُمَّ إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ لَمُسْرِفُونَ   
&gt;  
&gt; ""Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption \[done\] in the land – it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, \[even\] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors. ""

This is a wonderful quote. However, it does ring a bell. This is nearly the *exact* same quote found in Mishnah Sanhedrin 4-- a Jewish text regarding court proceedings in the Sanhedrin, or council. Here is the quote found in Sanhedrin 4:5, in Hebrew which we then translate to English :

&gt;לפיכך נברא אדם יחידי בעולם, ללמד שכל המאבד נפש אחת, מעלים עליו כאילו איבד עולם מלא; וכל המקיים נפש אחת,מעלים עליו כאילו קיים עולם.  
&gt;  
&gt;  It was for this reason that man was first created as one person \[Adam\], to teach you that **anyone who destroys a life is considered by Scripture to have destroyed an entire world; and anyone who saves a life is as if he saved an entire world.""** 

So, *what exactly is the problem?*

The premise of Islam is essentially the idea that God is one and perfect, and that the Quran is perfectly preserved as the word of God. If so, why would God use a nearly identical quote made by the Sanhedrin as his word?

In my opinion, this suggests that Mohammed picked up on parts of the Talmud here and there throughout his career as a merchant, and mistook the Sanhedrin ruling for the literal text of the Torah.

Again, I'd like to mention that I am not trying to be arrogant, but this is just my opinion on the reading and texts.

I asked him for the IMEI for the phone ( this is so i can check to see if the phone is locked to any carrier or not) gave me the IMEI and it wasn’t locked. Than the seller said hell give it to me for free as he switched to android and he was about to throw the phone out.

religion,Why should I feel guilty? I am not a sinner.,"I converted to Christianity two years ago from more or less agnosticism. But one thing I dont understand about Christians (Catholics at least as I dont know any Protestants or Orthodox) is why should I consider myself a sinner and constantly feel guilty and beg for forgiveness when I don´t sin?  
I follow every rule established by New testament, I pray daily and I am willing to say that I do more than what is required of one in New Testament. And God, who is kind and just blessed me with good fortune that I, in accordance with teachings of Jesus, share with others.   
So I dont understand why Catholics, even the ones who go way above and beyond of what is expected of them still feel sinful and ask for forgiveness. If you were guilty God would punish you here on earth as well as in afterlife. Your good fortune is the proof that God smiles upon your behavior. So why the guilt and self flagelation? Be happy that you are pleasing God.  
Jesus and his apostoles gave us in New Testament very clear set of rules which is by no means difficult to follow if you try. The rules Church has established are good but if they were important they would be in the Bible in the first place. So not following some of the literal nonsense Church came up with over the ages clearly isnt a big deal to warrant the amount of guilt in Catholic community.

religion,Divine Hiddenness Is The Strongest Argument Against God's Existence,"The most rational, common sense argument against the existence of any personal God IMO is the fact that their existence isn't obvious. If any of these gods existed, we should expect their existence to be as obvious as the sun being there or the moon.

Why you ask? Because:

These Gods want you to follow them, worship them, obey their moral commandments, and condemn every other religion as blasphemous. What sense does it make that a being like this wouldn't do the utmost to prove they were real to you? Humans are under no obligation to sit around wondering about the origin of the cosmos, or debating whether there's any merit to any of the religious superstition in the world. So how can any nonbeliever be rationally blamed for their unbelief?

It gets even worse when you consider that the major two religions of the world (Christianity and Islam) both state that nonbelief alone can send a person to hell. Well, if the stakes are THAT high and that important, shouldn't these deities be doing everything in their power to convince us they are real? Especially the Christian God since he claims to be ""All-Loving.""

The other problem is religious pluralism. There are hundreds of religions in the world, thousands throughout history - How are we supposed to know which God to worship? The Christian God? The Islamic God? The Jewish one? The Hindu ones? One of the many Polytheistic ones from back in the day (The Ancient Egyptian Gods, The Gods of Rome, The Viking Gods, The Aztec Gods, The Gods Of Ancient Greece, etc.)? If a God does nothing to show us that he/she/it/they exist, then there's no way to rationally blame anyone for worshipping the wrong god, or sending them to hell over it

Can anyone deny the validity of this argument? The common responses you hear is ""God works in mysterious ways"", which is a non-argument, or that God hides his existence because he's afraid if people knew he existed it would make belief in him too cohesive, etc. These are weak oppositions! For all the reasons stated, we should expect to see undeniable proof of these beings if they were real. In terms of sheer probablity, I don't think it can be denied that this is a strong reason (perhaps even the strongest) for doubting any personal God's existence.",1582226637.0

Shidad ibn al-Had reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came out to us for one of the evening prayers and he was carrying his grandson Hasan, or Husayn. The Prophet came forward and put him down, then began prayer with exaltation and prayed. He prostrated at the end of his prayer for a long time. I raised my head and the child was upon the Prophet’s back while he was prostrating, so I returned to my prostration. When the Prophet finished the prayer, people said, “O Messenger of Allah, you prostrated at the end of your prayer for a long time, until we thought something happened or you received a revelation.” The Prophet said, “None of that that happened. Rather, my grandson was riding on my back and I disliked to rush him before he met his needs.”

religion,The humour of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ,"Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was warmhearted and friendly and occasionally, he joked with the people around him. Due to his fitrah (nature) he always acted in moderation. His gentleness is also referred to in the Holy Quran: ""It was by a mercy from God that, you (O Messenger) were lenient with them. Had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would surely have scattered away from about you.""(Al-i Imran, 3/159).

As related by Anas b. Malik: Once a man came to the Prophet and wanted to give him a ride on his camel. The Prophet replied: “We should give you a ride on a baby camel then.”
“O Messenger of Allah, how can I ride on a baby camel?”
The Prophet replied:
“Are not all camels the babies of a mother camel?” (Abu Dawud, Adab, 92; Tirmizi, Birr, 57)

Again narrated by Anas b. Malik: A bedouin named Zahir brought presents from the desert to the Prophet. As he was leaving, the Prophet also gave him presents and told him:
“Zahir represents us living in the desert and we represent him living in the city.” Although he was physically an ugly man, the Prophet loved him dearly. While Zahir was shopping, the Prophet hid himself behind him and asked “Who am I?” Zahir recognized him.
Then the Prophet asked “Who is going to buy this slave?”
Zahir replied: “O Messenger of Allah, do you find me worthless then?”
The Prophet replied:
“Are you not a slave of Allah? You are very worthy in Allah’s presence (Ahmad b. Hanbal, Tirmizi, Kandahlavi, III, 1176).

Once Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was playing with his grandsons Hasan and Hussein. The kids were sitting on his shoulders. When Umar saw this, he told the children:
“How precious is your horse!”
The Prophet replied:
“They are fine riders as well.” (Heysemi, ibid, IX, 181-182).

Nuayman was one of the most humorous companions and he loved the Prophet dearly. Whenever a fine item came to Medina, he would buy it and then give it to the Prophet as a present. One day he saw that some fine quality honey had arrived Medina. He bought some and brought it to the Prophet. However he had not paid the salesman. He brought the salesman to the Prophet and told him to take the money from the Prophet. The Prophet asked:
“I thought you brought the honey as a present?”
Nuayman replied: “O Messenger of Allah!  I wanted you to taste this fine honey so much, but since I didn't have any money, I did it this way.”
The Prophet laughed and paid the salesman (I. Abdilberr , el-Istiab, IV, 473).

A'ishah radiallahu 'anha said: That she accompanied the Prophet on a certain journey. At that time she was a mere girl and was neither fat nor bulky. The Prophet asked the people to move on, and they marched ahead. Then the Prophet said to me, ""Come on, let us have a race."" 'A'ishah says that she ran and remained much ahead of him. The Prophet kept quiet for some time. Later on when 'A'ishah grew fat and loose bodied, and she forgot the previous incident. Again she accompanied the Prophet on some journey. The Prophet again asked the people to march ahead, and they moved ahead. Then the Prophet again asked her to have a race with him. This time the prophet defeated her and she lagged behind. Now the Prophet laughed and said, ""This is in reply to our previous defeat."" [Ahmad, Safwat as-Safwah, vol. I, p. 68]",1589987641.0

religion,"Did you know that in the Bible God had children sacrificed in fire, then lied about it, and became egregiously offended when men desired to ask him why he gave laws for child sacrifice in fire. This means that the Bible's claim ""God is not a liar"" is a lie.","This post has been shortened, to understand the full context see:

[Child sacrifice by God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/iuzln2/the_christian_claim_that_god_is_infinitely_more/) Specifically point 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**""God is not a man, that he should lie"" (Num. 23:19)**

**""This   is what we have heard from Jesus and now declare to you, God is light,   and in him there is no darkness at all"", (1 John 1:5).**

What's   interesting to note is this, the Christian articles that defend this   particular issue conveniently leave out God's lying in Jeremiah, and   make it sound -- to the best of their ability, that God did not give   these laws for child sacrifice. I can see how someone who is unread on   this topic would easily fall for what it is they are saying. This is why   you need to examine both secular and apologetic sources and compare   them. The below is an article I read when I was a Christian -- I didn't   go further from there because Christians are known as being honest in   their work. Lying is a sin that sends you to the lake of fire after all,   I trusted what they were saying was accurate.

But   to my surprise, the Christian apologetic sources are suppressing   information. Here is what they aren't telling you in their apologetic   material (they are too scared in admitting this).  The article below   does not address God **lying**   in Jeremiah, which every scholar that doesn't have a Christian agenda   has concluded or touched upon. It is also conveniently one of the first   articles to pop up when you search for ""Did God command child   sacrifice"", so among Christians it would be the majority opinion (I've   had several back and forths with people who were citing this article).

See this Christian article:  [https://www.str.org/w/god-didn-t-command-child-sacrifice](https://www.str.org/w/god-didn-t-command-child-sacrifice)

2 things I noticed in this article:

1. It   gives a strawman in saying that unbelievers desired to say God  delights  in child sacrifice.No scholar says this. It is very obvious to  me what  they are doing, they are trying to fight for an argument  nobody is  arguing for, one that is easy to crush but dishonest, in  order to give  their article more validity, making it seem they know  what they're  talking about.
2. The   article did not mention the verse in Jeremiah at all which again,  every  scholar who does not have a Christian agenda admits as being a  case  where God is lying to the Isrealites -- saying he did not give the  laws  for child sacrifice when he in fact did. Let's examine the  relevant  verses.

Let's  first look  at Ezekiel 20 where God gets egregiously offended and  refuses to be   inquired of by the Isrealites when they desire to  question him on the  laws for child sacrifice he had given them. God  being unnecessarily  offended is also hinting at an immoral act which  God is committing and  is aware of. Give particular attention to the the  last sentence in the  Bible verses quote below.

Ezekiel 20:

(25)    **I \[God\] even gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by  which   they could not live.** (26) I  defiled them by their gifts, by  their making   every firstborn pass over, so that **I might horrify them,  so that they   would know that I am the Lord**.(30)    Therefore, say to the  house of  Israel: Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Is  it  with the conduct of  your  fathers that you are defiled/defiling    yourselves, and after  their gods (*siqqusehem* for *'elohehem*)      that you are whoring? (31) When you make your offerings, when you    make   your sons to pass over by the fire, you are defiled/defiling     yourselves  with all your idols to this day. So shall I be inquired of     by you, house  of Israel? **By my life—word of the Lord Yahweh!—** ***I shall not be inquired  of by you!***

God   is getting offended because he knows men are putting their finger upon   his own immorality here, but let's see the actual lie in Jeremiah  where  God says the following:

""They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal--**something I did not command or mention, neither did it enter my mind**"" (Jeremiah 19:5).

Consider what God says, ""Something **I did not command**, neither did it **enter into my mind**"",

(Note: God did admit in Ezekiel 20 that **he did in fact give these laws for child sacrifice** as you just read earlier, ""I gave them statutes"", but I will get into that more below.)

Christians take this verse in Jeremiah and desire to relieve responsibility from God by quoting him saying that he ""**did not command**""   these laws on the people. But tell me, what is worse, commanding the   laws to be obeyed or giving the laws to be obeyed? Is there a   difference? The Christians that I've talked to on this for some reason   cling to this argument, ""God didn't command it"", but I point out God's   words in saying he did give the laws for child sacrifice. But they cling   to it still, ""God did not command it"", do you see how dishonest this   argumentation is? If I shot you in the head then said I didn't desire to   do it, would that argument work in court? No. The actual answer would   be: I shot you in the head because I desired to do it. But then I lied   about not wanting to do it because I desired to escape culpability, and   maintain my morality.

The verse in Jeremiah has God as saying the following regarding child sacrifice: ""**neither did it enter my mind"",** is it possible for an **omniscient** God to be unaware of something in a universe he himself created? ""...**neither did it enter my mind.""**

No. This is a lie in and of itself.

**""God.. knows everything."" (1 John 3:20)**

**""His understanding is beyond measure."" (Psalm 147:5)**

**""His understanding is unsearchable."" (Isaiah 40:28)**

These are only a few of the many verses touching upon God's omniscience.

**To    be sure, the notion of a ""Demonic and Scheming"" side to Yahweh is not    an innovation, either within Ezekiel, or within the Bible (Ezek 3:20;    14:9; cf. the ""hardening of hearts"" in Exod 7:3; 10:1; Isa 63:17;  also 2   Sam 24:1; 1 Kgs 22:20-23; Isa 6:9-10).**

The   conclusion is this, God did give the laws for child sacrifice. But  then  the Christian is trying to defend God by saying ""He did not  command  it"", to me this is just a dishonest.

Even Conservative  Christian commentaries on the  verse  in question has it as God giving  them laws for child sacrifice:

**Ellicott's Commentary** on Ezekiel 20:25 -- ""I \[God\] also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live.   *I defiled them*      through their gifts--the sacrifice of every firstborn--that I might      fill them with horror so they would know that I am the LORD.""

&gt;""But how can the Lord say that ***He*** **gave these to them?** In the same way that it is said in [Isaiah 63:17](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-17.htm), “Why, O LORD, do y*ou* make us stray from y*our* ways and harden our hearts from fearing y*ou*? ” So also St. Paul says of the heathen ([Romans 1:21-28](https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-21.htm)) that God “gave them up to uncleanness,” “unto vile affections,” “to a reprobate mind”.

And   before you get into the Romans 1 argument of God ""giving people over  to  their sins"", please think about this -- God sees people suffering  and  being evil, and decides in his  loving wisdom to maximize their  anguish  and the suffering of their  children even more. God was not   the first  one to have children  sacrificed in  fire, he  was punishing   people by  giving them ""laws of  death"" which involved  child sacrifice   since they  failed in obeying  ""the laws of life"" **(All of  this presumes Romans 1 where God ""gives people over/adding fuel to the fire as punishment"").**    So as punishment this loving and righteous  God  had parents  sacrifice   their children, further causing them and  their children to  suffer as   punishment for their sins. Why should men worship a God like  this?

 A   question, why does a God who self describes himself as  ""Love"",   ""Just"" and most importantly, ""Having in him no darkness at  all"" (1  John  1:5) see people who he knows are weak, who he calls  simple and  easily  led astray into temptation, who he calls ""Foolish  and  unintelligent""  (Jer. 4:22), ""Every man is stupid and without  knowledge""  (Jer. 10:14),  and also ""knows our \[weak\] frame, he  remembers that we  are but dust"" (Ps  103:14), etc. How does a God like  this see people who  are led astray--  and instead of helping them,  decides to further their  suffering and the  pain of their children by  deciding to ""give them  statutes that were not  good and ordinances by  which they could not live  ... in order so that I  might horrify them,  so that they would know  that I am the LORD""? 

This   same theme is seen everywhere in  scripture, for  instance Elisha and   the 42 youths, where instead of  helping them  psychologically or   spiritually, God decides it is okay to  slaughter the  42 of them with   bears for making a joke. ""He knows our  frame"" the  scripture states,   yet why does he behave in a way that is  all too human?  Shoot first,   ask questions later? He had no problem in  helping Phaoraoh  be a   dictator by continually hardening his heart, so  why doesn't he help    people in the same manner? Why kill the children  and the pregnant    mothers of the Cananites instead of helping them  spiritually and    morally? The opposite God did with Pharaoh? Instead of  hardening his    heart, softening their hearts so they become better  people, and open    their eyes to love?

The Christian   scholars with agendas (like the one I linked above) fail to bring up  the  lie God gives in Jeremiah and instead bring up a strawman.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see what the **unbiased** scholars say about God's lying about child sacrifice:

**Discussing  the Ezekiel passage, Milgrom   notes that “\[r\]ather than  denying that  God ever sanctioned human   sacrifice as does his older  contemporary  Jeremiah (Jer 7:31; 19:5;   32:35), Ezekiel uniquely takes  the tack  that God deliberately gave such   a law in order to desolate  them.”⁸**

**Milgrom continues, that**

&gt;**The only way to justify Ezekiel’s** **theodicy** **is     that the people misinterpreted either Exod 22:28b (de Vaux 1964: 72)    or  Exod 13:1-2 . . . or that God deliberately misled them to punish    them  (Greenberg 1983, 368-70; Hals 1989: 141), on the analogy of God     hardening Pharaoh’s heart or Israel’s heart (52)⁹**

Milgrom says there is deceptiveness going on here. The same with Heider in his Cult of Molek:

**The Yale PhD, Old Testament Professor states,**

**""..in    v. 26 Ezekiel's   counterpart to Jeremiah's insistance that child    sacrifice was    something ""which I did not command, nor did it enter    into my mind""    (7:31; 19:5; 32:35). Both prophets' remarks are in    response to the    people's claim that Yahweh had, indeed, legislated    child sacrifice,    which they were offering him in the cult of Molek.    Jeremiah  does not   give the people's basis for this claim, but he    responds to it  with a   flat denial. Ezekiel, on the other hand, tells    us that the  people were   applying (or misapplying; cf. 4.3.2) the   most  closely  applicable law,   the ""Law of the Firstborn"" in Exodus.   Then,  in a  baroque twist worthy  of  the prophet, Ezekiel  turns the    theological tables on the  practitioners:  very well, Yahweh  did give    the law they were citing,  but it was given  so that obedience  would    not bring life, but would  ""horrify"" them. If  Israel would not  obey    God's good laws for life,  they would obey his bad  laws for death,   but   they** ***would*** **obey.**

**In light of God's deceptive behavior Heider comments:**

**""The    notion of a ""Demonic  side to Yahweh is not  an innovation, either    within  Ezekiel, or  within   the Bible (Ezek  3:20; 14:9; cf. the    ""hardening of  hearts"" in  Exod  7:3;  10:1; Isa  63:17; also 2 Sam    24:1; 1 Kgs 22:20-23;  Isa  6:9-10)**

**Hence my saying, ""Every honest scholar identifies this lie on the part of YHWH.""**

&amp;#x200B;

One  Christian argument that has been given to me on another occasion goes  like this: What God did here was similar to how people treat alcoholics  that do not want to change their ways. Friends and family see him  drinking his life away, deteriorating his organs, he is stubborn so  instead of helping him, they decide to leave him to his own misery, so  that he would find out himself how harmful his ways are (which often  times ends up in a slow death).

But  this argument doesn't make sense because in order for it to be an  accurate comparison to what God did, the following has to be true:

You,  as a family member or acquaintance see a person in your life that is  wasting away from drinking. You see that if this goes on, he will likely  die. But instead of getting him help, knowing his liver is failing him,  you not only leave him to his own misery, **but  in addition get him even more cases of alcohol, supplying him with his  daily dose of poison, and forcing him to drink the alcohol. Not in  kindness or love, but in a malicious, torturing way, so that you ""might  horrify them"", as the text in Ezekiel states God did. You are not only  letting him die, but you yourself are supplying him everything he needs  to kill himself. And then you turn around and say, ""I condemn alcohol  addiction"".**

But comparing  a mere substance addiction to having children melted in fire is a false  comparison. A kind and moral person would jump out of his seat in order  to help children if they saw them being sacrificed, a heartless,  malicious sovereign would \*\*make parents do it.\*\*This is the way in  which God goes about in ""condemning child sacrifice"", by giving laws to  have children melted in fire in order so that ""he might horrify them and  know that I am the Lord!"" this is what the good and kind God who  describes himself as [love](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/isuzzr/the_bibles_claim_that_god_is_love_is_false_by_the/) does to people.

An  excerpt from  Francesca  Stavrokopoulou's ""King Manasseh and Child  Sacrifice"",  a  Professor of  Hebrew Bible and Ancient Religion at the  University of  Exeter:

""Interestingly,  Ezek 20:25-26 makes no mention of redemption provisions, yet it does    offer the closest expression of an **ethical condemnation**  of child    sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible.  The practice is not  rejected in this    text because it is ""foreign""; rather, it is accepted  as a ritual native    to YHWH-worship, yet designed to defile and to  horrify its    practitioners.  Though the cultic connotations and  implications of exile    are clear, the theological tone of these  particular verses hints at a    uniquely ethical condemnation of child  sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible.""

It  is an ethical condemnation of child sacrifice because it is done by a  God, if anyone else went about in doing this they would be called sick  in the mind and deserving of death. But simply because no one can stop  him, as even God said, ***""I will not be inquired of by you!""*** he gets to do whatever he wants, whether it is raping women, cannibalizing children or in this case having them melted in fire.

God  is ""condemning child sacrifice"" by giving laws to have children melted  in fire. This is like a person desiring to show that wife beating is  immoral, so he goes about and beats the living daylights out of his wife  and displays her bruised body to the world in order to horrify them, so  that they would ""know that wife beating is bad"".

He does not care for the pain of the children, but as you saw in Ezekiel, he did it so that **""I might horrify them, so that they would know that I am the Lord!""**  the same thing we see with Pharaoh, the reason God raised Pharaoh up  and continually hardens his heart in order for numerous human lives to  be killed and molested in the process, was all so that he could boast  about it,  ""For Scripture says to Pharaoh: ""I raised you up for this  very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name  might be proclaimed in all the earth"" (Rom. 9:17), the same thing we see  with God's bet to Satan in Job, where Job and those closest to him get  murdered and molested to satisfy God's own ego.",1601049331.0

religion,The homosexuality question,"This is to all fellow Christians, as it seems to me that Muslims get this pretty well. But I would like to know the reasoning of fellow brothers and sisters in faith who outright deny the Bible in defence of this sin.  
Let´s remind ourselves what the Word of God says on the issue.  
""For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.""  -  Romans 1:26-27

and

""Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers—none of these will inherit the kingdom of God. And this is what some of you used to be. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.""  - Corinthians 6:9-11  


For the sake of argument lets not mention Leviticus as not all of us believe in the Old Testament. Now I feel like it´s pretty clear that homosexuality is a sin. Sin that can be forgiven, as Corinthians suggest, but its still a sin and you will not reach Heaven unless you are ""washed, sanctified and justified"". Meaning unless you stop commiting sins. A thief will hardly be forgiven if he keeps stealing even after asking for forgiveness.   
And we have proof of this in the word of our Lord Jesus, in the story of Mary Magdalene. For reference:  


 “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women.Now what do you say?” They were using this question as a trap,in order to have a basis for accusing him.

But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.

At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”

“No one, sir,” she said.

“Then neither do I condemn you,”Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.” - John 8  


People always point to this moment as Jesus simply forgiving anything and that no matter how a person behaves we will be forgiven. That´s such awful misinterpretation. He clearly tells Mary to leave the life of sin. He had the right to judge her, because he was the only one without sin but he forgave her under he condition that she stops being a sinner. That she will stop being an edulterer. Bible clearly said that it is OK if you sinned. Everybody does. Its about how you tackle the sin. Certainly not by keeping at it.   
So in our case there is no reason to believe that homsexuality is any different. It is a sin. And unless you repent you will not be forgiven for it. But a homosexual person can leave that life and seek forgiveness and reach Heaven.   
So my question is why is there so many fellow Christians who keep on denying the Bible. When it is so clear on the issue. Maybe to conform to the liberals? Sad to see the Word of God being subservient to world politics if that´s the case.",1588162492.0

religion,The Anti Christ,"Father is said to be the ETERNAL LIFE, the only true God (John 17:3).

The Father is said to be through all, over all and in all (Ephesians 4:6), which means, the Father is in us all, He is the life in us that cause us to exist, this is the spirit within but impersonal to our choices, so that we may have a life of our own in a sense that we can freely choose, this is the gift of freewill but sometimes a curse when you don’t know how to used it. The Life in us is inherently eternal, it does not experience death. Death is simply a consequence of life or spirit leaving us. As the bible says, spirit always return to God (Ecc 12:7).

The Son is said to be the Power and Wisdom of God (1 Cor 1:24). He is the one showing or expressing the power and wisdom which He saw from the Father, for after all He is the Image of the invisible God. As the Son says, whatever He sees from the Father, He does (John 5:19).

What does it mean to be an Anti Christ then?

1 John 2:22 says, Anti Christ is the One who denies the Father and Son. Meaning, you deny the Father when you deny life that is in you and in your neighbour. If you kill it, does not take care of it, or disregard it, it is as good as denying the Father. Now, if you do take care of life seemingly not denying the Father but does not show or express the wisdom and power of it, you then deny the Son.

So you see, not denying the Father and Son is taking care, or valuing life that is in us, and at the same time showing and or representing that life’s wisdom and power to the rest of the world.",1586995918.0
religion,Humility is an God's Attribute-- The Christian's God,"God is God because He exists before anyone and anything else and all things trace their source back to Him and none can see His end.  He is eternal. He is also mightier and greater than all. He alone deserves worship.

However this God of the Christians is a God that listens and speaks to His creatures. He doesn't make us feel He is too great to interact directly with us. He does not make us feel inferior in His presence although none compares to Him. He doesn't need to; He knows Who He is and our attitudes does not change Him, they only affect us.

Someone made a post that Allah is not humble and says the humility of Jesus is an evidence that Jesus is not God. The pride of Allah is definitely evident in the Qur'an, so I know where such views come from.
My question to people who hold such  believe is: ""Who is the source of humility? If it is God, what is the evidence of humility in Allah?""

In Jesus, God does not only command us to believe He exists, to love ourselves and to be humble-- and humility is also an attribute of love-- He practically revealed Himself and showed us that we all are worth dying for. He died for us and rose again. 
Don't ask how can God die because the Christian's God is greater than human brain can comprehend and is not limited by our reasoning capacities. He is not just a single person like you, though He is One God in His being. This has nothing to do with what any religion believThatIt is His reality regardless of who believes something different but similar or who believes the opposite.

This great God is seen in the Bible as allowing us to come up with ideas and opinions and abiding by it even if He has another way of sorting things out. That is humility and a display of confidence in His unlimited ability. He only demands submission to His will when it comes to His eternal plans and how He created all things to work together for good. We hurt not only ourselves and not only our neighbours but also other creatures when we don't surrender to this humble God who loved us enough to live among us, experience our pains and temptations and provide a practical path to victory over even our last enemy, even death-- a victory everyone who put their trust in Jesus will experience unto everlasting life of everlasting love and joy.",1586430207.0

religion,"God made Humans, Humans made religion","I'm agnostic and I feel strongly about my title. There are so many religions and each attempting to guide you to heaven.

By inclusive I mean, you have to belong to that faith and abide by it to reach ""Heaven"" or its equivalent state and in particularly Sikhism says you can be hindu, Muslim or Christian and still go to heaven (thus exclusive).

With loyalty to each religion, people of their faith  feel strongly and think that their religion is only absolute truth.

religion,Picking a religion shouldn't be logical,"I see a lot of people asking how to pick a religion or why others believe in their current one.  I think what many people are missing here is that you should not be using your brain for this kind of decision.  It's not like buying a car and picking one within your budget and finding an affordable payment with a low interest rate lol.

You need to open your heart and FEEL what is right.  You should be feeling good positive energy from your beleifs. You should be feeling love from your God and those around you.  So many people have turned off their emotions and feelings it's like we forgot as a culture what it's like to truly feel love again.  How you feel is much more important than what you think.

Before you even worry about picking a religion I would say be sure to fix yourself and make sure you have the ability to feel emotions first.  You should get emotionally lifted from things like Mozart and watching puppies.  You should be emotionally torn watching videos of people failing or getting hurt.  You should be able to feel love, not just 'say' love, but FEEL love for those around you.

When you can do that I think you will be ready to make a much better decision on what religion feels right for you.  Picking a religion without the ability to feel strong emotions is like buying a car without a sense of smell.  You might buy one that looks good but has a stinking fish odor stuck inside of it.  Then when you go show it off to your friends they all tell you it's horrible cause it smells but you think it's great.

That's about the best analogy I can give for this.  I see so many people today, especially the younger generation, taking pleasure in things that should be causing them pain.  Like watching videos of people failing (fail army), watching people dying, burning, getting lost in alternate realities through video games, causing others pain and laughing at other people's misery.

Clean yourself up first.  Get to a place where your emotions are strong and you know you can trust them.  Otherwise it's almost like asking a robot to pick a religion.  It would be very hard for them to find one.  Part of being human and having a soul is the ability to FEEL what is good.  Not just think what is good.",1593274540.0
religion,"""Custom Built"" religion: could this work? Any flaws?","Hello, my parents and grandparents were all atheists, so when I discovered a need for something spiritual, I was sort of ""in the void"" and my spiritual path took several turns. I had several spiritual experiences. Now I am trying to establish a religious basis for my life, but the problem is that in every major religion there are both things that ""ring a bell"" and things I cannot relate to. As an analogy with computer software (yes, I am a nerd), when the default setup does not work for you, you can select different options and make a ""custom build"" of the software. 
  
The question is: can you do something like that with religion? Or do you just end with a chaotic mess with parts that don't work together?  
  
Part of my family is ethnically Jewish (although they are religion-wise mostly atheists) so Judaism was the first ""pick"": what I like the most is the idea of direct connection to God without anybody or anything ""in between"" and worshipping anything/anybody else is considered an idolatry. But what scares me is all those 613 mitzvot with detailed rules for life, Talmud on top of that - all that seems so strict for me and I feel a need for more freedom. On top of that I am a gourmet, so kashrut is not a thing for me.  
  
About Christianity: I have read C.S.Lewis' books and they seem sound, but I don't like the idea of intermediary between you and God (Jesus, priests) and worshipping Jesus is an idolatry from Jewish point of view. I also don't like the idea of eternal hell.  
  
Buddhism: I tried meditation, it helped me with my life, the notion of ""let's cease the suffering, this is the thing we want to do"" seems rational, but I don't like the idea of re-incarnation. Living more lives all over again, without memory of the previous ones seems inhuman to me, sort of like Sisiphus rolling his boulder all over again.  
  
So my ""custom build"", taken from those three considerations, is this:
  
1. God is real (makes purpose in life and sense that everything is under control)  
2. Direct connection from human to God via prayer (like in Judaism) or meditation  
3. Not too many strict rules or rituals (as opposed to orthodox Judaism)
4. one life being lived, after that an afterlife, when you meed your loved ones again (perhaps with purgatory first which cleanses you, but I am not sure about the need of this one)
  
Do you see any flaws or dangers in that? Maybe I will more relate with contemporary authors like Donald Walsh or Anita Moorjani, but I don't want to fall into New Age trap, when you have chaos in mind and ""everything goes with everything"". Maybe there's an actual religion that covers my ""custom build"" fully and I am just not aware of it: any thoughts?",1587657933.0
religion,Why do Atheists even Bother Arguing?,"I used to be one myself, yet I could care less if anyone believed in God or not. Because atheism isn't really anything that needs to be pushed on anyone for any real reason other than an argumentative personality.

Simply put, if the atheists are correct in their view of eschatology, then we'll never actually know they were right once we're all dead -- because we'll all be in a mindless oblivion. Thus the argumentative atheist will never be able to boast how his adamant views on life after death were correct, and if he could have the ability to boast at that point then he'd be incorrect in the first place. So why not take a live and let live stance on these issues as an atheist?",1589911894.0
religion,30 Facts About Islam,"1) “Islam” means “surrender” or “submission”. “Salam” (which means “peace”) is the root word of “Islam”. In a religious context the word “Islam” means “the surrendering of one’s will (without compulsion) to the true will of God in an effort to achieve peace”.  


2) “Muslim” means “anyone or anything that surrenders itself to the true will of God”. By this definition, everything in nature (trees, animals, planets, etc.) are “muslims” because they are in a state of surrender to God’s will. In other words, they are fulfilling the purpose for which God created them.  


3) Islam is not a new religion or cult. It is a universal way of life and civilization. Studies show that between 1.5 and 1.8 billion people in the world identify their religion as Islam. Along with Judaism and Christianity it traces its roots through Prophet Abraham and back to the first humans Adam and Eve.  


4) There are five pillars of practice in Islam. These practices must be undertaken with the best of effort in order to be considered a true Muslim: A) Declaration of faith: A statement proclaiming the belief in One God and that Muhammad is a prophet of God. To become Muslim a person simply recites this statement publicly, and in Arabic. B) Formal prayer five times a day. C) Poor-due tax: 2.5% of one’s excess wealth given to the needy once a year. D) Fasting during the daylight hours in the month of Ramadan. E) Pilgrimage to Mecca at least once, if physically and financially able.  


5) There are six articles of faith in Islam. These are the basic beliefs that one must have in order to be considered a true Muslim. They are belief in: A) the One God. B) all of the true prophets of God. C) the original scriptures revealed to Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad. D) the angels. E) the Day of Judgment and the Hereafter. F) destiny.  


6) Muslims believe in the one Creator of the Universe, referring to Him as “Allah” . 

Allah is no different than the God of Abraham, Moses and Jesus. The Creator is the Creator regardless of what people call Him. In the English language He is most commonly referred to as “God”. Yet Jesus spoke a different language, referring to God as “Eloi” in Mark 15:34 of the New Testament. Are “God” and “Eloi” different gods? Many Hispanics call God “Dios” and many French say “Dieu”. It would logically follow then that people who refer to God as “Allah” in the Arabic language are referring to the very same God. In fact, many Arab Jews and Arab Christians call God “Allah”. And the word “Allah” is written in Arabic script on the walls of many Arab churches and on the pages of Arabic Bibles. So while the understanding of God may differ between faith groups, the various names used to describe Him does not change the fact that the one Creator of the Universe is the God of all people.  


7) The Islamic concept of God is that He is loving, merciful and compassionate. Islam also teaches that He is all-knowing and the perfect judge of affairs, and will punish (or forgive) accordingly. However, Allah once said to Muhammad, “My mercy prevails over my wrath”. So Islam teaches a balance between fear and hope, protecting one from both complacency and despair.  


8) Muslims believe that God has revealed 99 of His names, or attributes, in the Qur’an. It is through these names that one can come to know the Creator. A few of these names are the All-Merciful, the All-Knower, the Protector, the Provider, the Near, the First, the Last, the Hidden and the Source of All Peace.  


9) The Christian concept of “vicarious atonement” (the idea that Jesus died for the sins of humanity) is alien to the Islamic concept of personal responsibility. Islam teaches that on the Day of Judgment every person will be resurrected and will be accountable to God for their every word and deed. Consequently, a practicing Muslim is always striving to be righteous while hoping and praying for God’s acceptance and grace.  


10) Muslims believe in all of the true prophets that preceded Muhammad, from Adam to Jesus. Muslims believe they brought the same message of voluntarily surrendering to God’s will (islam, in a generic sense) to different peoples at different times. Muslims also believe they were “muslims” (again, in a generic sense) since they followed God’s true guidance and surrendered their will to Him.  


11) Muslims neither worship Muhammad nor pray through him. Muslims worship the Unseen, Omniscient Creator, Allah.  


12) Muslims accept the original unaltered Torah (as revealed to Moses) and the original unaltered Bible (as revealed to Jesus) since they were revealed by God. But none of these scriptures exist today in their original form or in their entirety. Therefore, Muslims follow the subsequent, final and preserved revelation of God, the Qur’an.  


13) The Qur’an was not authored by Muhammad. It was authored by God, revealed to Muhammad (through angel Gabriel) and written into physical form by his companions.  


14) The original Arabic text of the Qur’an contains no flaws or contradictions and has not been altered since its revelation.  


15) Actual 7th century Qur’ans, complete and intact, are on display in museums in Turkey and other places around the world.  


16) If all Qur’ans in the world today were destroyed, the original Arabic would still remain. This is because millions of Muslims, called “hafiz” (or “guardians”) have memorized the text letter for letter from beginning to end, every word and every syllable. Also, chapters from the Qur’an are precisely recited from memory in each of the five formal prayers performed daily by hundreds of millions of Muslims throughout the world.  


17) Sharia is the law that regulates the daily life of a Muslim and serves as a guide for living by Islamic principles. As Islam is not only a belief system but a complete way of life, the law covers all aspects of living including moral, spiritual, intellectual, physical, economical, political, etc. Sharia law is derived by scholars through interpretations of Islam’s canonical texts, the Qur’an and Hadith (sayings and actions of Muhammad). As with any legal system the interpretations can range across the liberal-conservative spectrum, and opinions on the meanings and applications will often differ. Therefore sharia law is essentially an effort to comprehend God’s instructions and apply them in daily life. Since the interpretations are made by humans, they are subject to error and even perversion. This occurs when unqualified, ignorant and/or corrupted individuals make the interpretation. For instance the KKK perverts Christian texts to conjure up false rulings. The same can be said for certain Muslim groups and so-called “Islamic states” regarding Islamic texts. While there is no Pope in Islam to serve as the authoritative interpreter, there are recognized institutions and scholars whom analyze, discuss, deliberate and arrive at reasonable rulings through a process known as “fiqh” (Islamic jurisprudence). This nuanced and sophisticated science operates on the premise that the Islamic texts are fluid and dynamic; that anything outside of the very basic tenets can, and should, be interpreted according to the particular time, place and culture. So if any version of sharia advocates brutality, injustice, extremism, terrorism, etc., the question must be asked: are such rulings endorsed by mainstream Islamic scholars, or are they being posited by those devoid of a true understanding of the religion, or the wisdom to apply it?  


18) Some attribute the early and rapid spread of Islam to forced conversions by the sword. While it is accurate that the Muslim empire initially spread, for the most part, through battles and conquests (a common phenomenon for that time) the religion of Islam itself was never forced on anyone who found themselves living under Muslim rule. In fact, non-Muslims were afforded the right to worship as they pleased as long as a tax, called “jizyah”, was paid. During the Dark Ages, Jews, Christians and others were given protection by the Muslims from religious persecutions happening in Europe. Islam teaches no compulsion in religion (Qur’an 2:256 and 10:99). For more, read “The Spread of Islam in the World” by Thomas Arnold.  


19) Terrorism, unjustified violence and the killing of non-combatant civilians (and even intimidating, threatening or injuring them) are all absolutely forbidden in Islam. Islam is a way of life that is meant to bring peace to a society whether its people are Muslim or not. The extreme actions of those who claim to be Muslim may be a result of their ignorance, frustration, uncontrolled anger or political (not religious) ambitions. Anyone who condones or commits an act of terrorism in the name of Islam is simply not following Islam and is, in fact, violating its very tenets. These people are individuals with their own personal views and agendas. Fanatical Muslims are no more representative of the true teachings of Islam than fanatical Christians are of the true teachings of Christianity, or fanatical Jews are of the true teachings of Judaism. The most prominent examples of such “religious” fanatics are Anders Behring Breivik, the 2011 Norwegian terrorist who claimed in his manifesto to be “100 percent Christian” and Baruch Goldstein, perpetrator of the 1994 Hebron massacre who is considered by some Jews to be a “hero” and a “saint”. Extremism and fanaticism are problems not exclusive to Muslims. Anyone who thinks that all Muslims are terrorists should note that terror groups like ISIS (or ISIL), Al-Qaeda and Boko Haram kill Muslims as well. Also, the former boxer Muhammad Ali, perhaps the most celebrated person of our era, was a practicing Muslim.  


20) The word “jihad” does not mean “holy war”. It actually means “to struggle” or “to strive”. In a religious context it means the struggle to successfully surrender one’s will to the will of God. Some Muslims may say they are going for “jihad” when fighting in a war to defend themselves or others, but they say this because they are conceding that it will be a tremendous struggle. But there are many other forms of jihad which are much more relevant to the everyday life of a Muslim such as the struggles against laziness, arrogance, stinginess, one’s own ego, or the struggle against a tyrant ruler or against the temptations of Satan, etc. Regarding the so-called verses of “holy war” in the Qur’an, two points: A) The term “holy war” neither appears in the Arabic text of the Qur’an nor in any classical teachings of Islam. B) The vast majority of verses in the Qur’an pertaining to violence refer to wartime situations in which Muslims were permitted to defend themselves against violent aggression. Any rational, intellectual analysis of the context and historical circumstances surrounding such verses, often ignored by pundits or violent extremists, proves this to be true. Other verses of violence deal with stopping oppression, capital punishment and the like.  


21) Women are not oppressed in Islam. Any Muslim man that oppresses a woman is not following Islam. Among the many teachings of Muhammad that protected the rights and dignity of women is his saying, “…the best among you are those who treat their wives well.”  


22) Islam grants women many rights in the home and in society. Among them are the right to earn money, to financial support, to own property, to an education, to an inheritance, to being treated kindly, to vote, to a bridal gift, to keep their maiden name, to worship in a mosque, to a divorce, and so on.  


23) Muslim women wear the head-covering (hijab) in fulfillment of God’s decree to dress modestly. This type of modest dress has been worn by religious women throughout time such as traditional Catholic nuns, Mother Teresa and the Virgin Mary.  


24) Forced marriages, honor killings, female genital mutilation and the confinement of women to their homes are all forbidden in Islam. These practices stem from deeply entrenched cultural traditions and/or ignorance of the true Islamic teachings or how to apply them in society. Arranged marriages are allowed in Islam but are not required. In fact, one of the conditions for a valid Islamic marriage contract is the mutual consent of both parties to the marriage. And divorce is permissible provided the Islamic guidelines are followed which protect the rights of all affected parties, especially women and unborn children.  


25) Islam and the Nation “of Islam” are two different religions. Islam is a religion for all races and enjoins the worship of the One Unseen God who never took human form. On the other hand “the Nation” is a movement geared towards non-whites that teaches God appeared as a man named Fard Muhammad and that Elijah Muhammad was a prophet. According to orthodox Islam these are blasphemous beliefs that contradict the basic theology defined throughout the Qur’an and other authentic texts. The followers of “the Nation” adhere to some Islamic principles that are mixed with other practices and beliefs completely alien to authentic Islamic teachings. To better understand the differences read about Malcolm X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and his later comments to the media. Islam teaches equality amongst the races (Qur’an 49:13).  


26) All Muslims are not Arab, Middle-Eastern or of African descent. Islam is a universal religion and way of life that includes followers from all races. There are Muslims in and from virtually every country in the world. Arabs only constitute about 20% of Muslims worldwide. The countries with the largest Muslim populations are not located in the Middle East. They are Indonesia (over 200 million Muslims) and Pakistan and India (over 350 million Muslims combined).  


27) In the five daily prayers Muslims face the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is a cube-shaped stone structure that was built by Prophet Abraham and his son Ishmael on the same foundations where Prophet Adam is believed to have built a sanctuary for the worship of the One God. Muslims do not worship the Kaaba. It serves as a focal point for Muslims around the world, unifying them in worship and symbolizing their common belief, spiritual focus and direction. Interestingly the inside of the Kaaba is empty.  


28) The hajj is an annual pilgrimage to the Kaaba made by about 3 million Muslims from all corners of the Earth. It is performed to fulfill one of the pillars of Islam. The rituals of hajj commemorate the struggles of Abraham, his wife Hagar and their son Ishmael in surrendering their wills to God.  


29) Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world today. Conversions are a major factor but natural growth is the main reason. Statistically Muslim women have the highest fertility rates in the world. According to the Pew Research Center by the year 2050 Muslims will equal the number of Christians for the first time in history. Currently, the most popular name in the world is Muhammad. And perhaps most interesting is the fact that Muhammad (alternate spellings included) is the most popular name for newborn boys in England and Wales.  


30) Over the past 1400 years Muslim intellects have made substantial contributions in the areas of physics, medicine, mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, philosophy and geography. At no time was this more evident than in the Middle Ages, a period commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Islam”. It produced such luminaries as Jabir ibn Hayyan (considered the father of early chemistry), al-Khwarizmi (one of the fathers of algebra), al-Zahrawi (a father of surgery), al-Razi (father of pediatrics), Ibn Sina (one of the greatest medical scholars in history), Jabir ibn Aflah (promoter of trigonometry in Europe), Ibn Rushd (reviver of Aristotle) and Ibn Khaldun (a father of modern sociology, historiography, demography and economics) to name only a few. Their contributions ultimately helped to usher in the European Renaissance. This influence on Western civilization is recognized in a mural painted in the 1890s on the ceiling of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. Islam is included along with England, France, America, Greece, Rome and others in a depiction of the “Evolution of Civilization”.",1581171884.0
religion,Why do some claim the bible is factual or in some cases an historical record?,There are so many contradictions of reality and itself in the bible.,1584406349.0
religion,The Psyop of Organized Religion," Organized religion is a psyop which has 2 dimensions.

1. Exploit the poor, Colonialism and enforce fear and conformity on the population. As seen by the plunder of Africa. ""When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land. They said 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes. When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land."" -Desmond Tutu
2. By doing this, people would automatically begin to co-relate oppression with religion. This is done in order To drive people away from true religion - The bible is a spiritual text that uses symbolism and allegory to explain metaphysical and psychological phenomenon.

To illustrate the second point, i will take the example of the biblical book of exodus. Exodus is a book of symbolism that refers to the movement of the people from the Left Hemisphere of the brain(Egypt) which is represented through slavery and suffering to the Right Hemisphere of the brain(Israel) the land of plenty. THis is why the Egyptians could not cross the sea and follow the Israelites.

Exodus 14:12 *Is* not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For *it had been* better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

In the above verse, we see the Israelites crying and complaining to Moses(This happens multiple times throughout the journey) that they are suffering and would have been better off as slaves in Egypt. This is often refered to as stockholm syndrome today. People always look at the past longingly and people want to go back to ""how it was"" instead of being in the present moment and moving forward .

Moses then replied to the Israelites that they should hold their peace. What does this mean?

1. Be silent and stop complaining - Literal Interpretation
2. Stop overthinking, anxiety, other negative beliefs, and being in a state of fear which leads to the complaining in the first place - Psychological Interpretation
3. Hold the peace and be strong in the face of adversity - Spiritual Interpretation

Now, How can one hold the peace? It can be one only through awareness of self, Looking inwards and stop reacting to emotions and feelings. Eventually this leads to stilling or calming of the mind and reaching a state of no thought, focused on the ever-present moment.

""Uh! Open your eyes and look within:  
Are you satisfied (with the life you're living)? Uh!  
We know where we're going, uh!  
We know where we're from.  
We're leaving Babylon,  
We're going to our Father land. "" -Bob Marley's Exodus

Luke 17:21 "" Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. ""

By analyzing and intellectually understanding phenomenon(Left brain), you remain in Egypt/Slavery/Fear/Ego. On the other hand, by meditation(Holding the mind in a still and peaceful state), you are able to cross the red sea into Israel(Right brain) and be at peace in the presence of God the Creator.

We can see that such experiences are referred to as the ""wilderness/desert experience""- Israelites in the desert for 40 years(The book of exodus has 40 chapters), Noah was in his ark for 40 days and 40 nights, Jesus was tempted by the devil in the wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights. Elijah went 40 days without food or water at Mount Horeb. Goliath taunted Israel for 40 days before David defeated him.

All these stories have the same theme - The victory of the Right Brain(God) and virtues like love, peace, patience, brotherhood, charity, RESISTING TEMPTATION\[David, Moses, Abel\] over the Left Brain(Evil) FALLING FOR TEMPTATION and SIN like wrath, greed, envy, lust, sloth, gluttony etc.\[Goliath, Pharoh, Cain etc.\]

Every single religion that has existed on this planet advocates meditation starting from the Incas and NAtives of the Americas,Tribals in Africa, Hindus and Buddhists of Asia, Hebrews of the middle east and Modern day Christianity and Islam.

This is the knowledge that ""they"" are hiding from us because when people know this, all deceptions, tactics of divide and rule and other methods of control will fall away and people will be one.

He knows how things will end up with regards to every possible decision we could ever make and has a plan for each one of those possible scenarios.

I'll share my beliefs, to give you some context etc etc. I'm assume you're comfortable with me asking you questions, so feel free to ask me anything or criticize my beliefs. I'm here to learn, think, and understand. I have a open mind for anything.

I believe science is the 100% truth. I don't cherry pick science. Everything in science we can prove by replicating results again again. That means everything, evolution, medical advancements, etc. 

However, science and theories are something that can change and expand as our knowledge expands. I don't believe we know and understand much about the world around us, never mind the universe. 

I do believe there's life outside our world. But not in a conventional way. I think there has to be other life out there, somewhere. I don't think it's some tri omni being, but something else has to be out there. I believe evolution is true, it couldnt have only happened here. 

I dont believe in an afterlife. I believe we return to the state we were in before birth. 

I'm a huge secular humanist. We should defy good or evil by one simple question: does it hurt another human being or just any being in general? Now theres so many grey areas. You cant even answer ""is murder bad?"" without a grey area. I believe we should do what we do to help benefit someone or something in someway. But there are grey areas there too. But this all I believe comes from human nature, specifically empathy. We do what we do because we have empathy and understand the pain of others. I like how Jimmy Snow put it (paraphrased) ""[There's evidence that we survive with empathy] because of how horrible you feel if you just let you baby die."" 

As far as social issues go, I very much believe the whole all our blood runs red speech. We're all people, we're all equal, no one is above or below anything else. I'm very supportive of the GRSM community, abortion rights, gay rights, trans rights, womens rights, racial rights, etc etc. Everyone should have a voice, everyone should be seen as an equal, everyome should have free, non discriminatory access to basic rights like healthcare, education, justice of law, etc etc. 

I believe the meaning of life is whatever you make it to be. You make your own meaning, you do what you want. If thats an option for you. 

I believe that alot, most id even say, religions are harmful. I believe most religions use behaviour, thought, emotional, information, sexual, social, and maybe economic control.

Why I believe all this? Well to put it simply, a book written by man with no visible, viable proof just isnt enough for me. Science you can see, test, and replicate. Religion you can't. And this life is all we can be sure is real, might as well do all we can during our lives.

""God doesnt exist because it isnt realistic, its not realistic to turn water into wine or cause miracles, so therefore he is not real.""

No shit we humans cant walk on water, turn water to wine, or do any other crazy magical shit that God does. Thats why God is GOD, and why humans are HUMANS, because Gods are SUPPOSED to be above humans and our limits.

It's just baffling how this concept is so hard to grasp, and I know most atheists I met seem to get this, but some dont, and I feel rather confused.

religion,Yes... sometimes evil pays and wins.,"One of the most common lies most people believe- especially religious people but also many non-religious and atheists- is that people who do bad things are eventually punished or pay for their actions. After all naturally we want to believe that justice is always served.

Yet... history has taught us not only the opposite but it has sometimes even led us to what we are now. Example- the current state of the entire American continent is due to a series of extremely evil events 500 years ago approximately. Genocide by direct killing, diseases or health deterioration from all the abuse as well as rape and slavery from the Europeans eventually paid off in favor of the Europeans. Many Hispanic American countries still call Spain their motherland even after what they did. Of course nobody currently alive in Spain has anything to do with it, but history is history. Europe invaded, killed and/or removed the indigenous people, kidnapped people from Africa who never got to see their relatives again, and now almost all of us from all ethnicities speak English, Spanish, French and Portuguese, and most of the countries see the countries as their “motherland”.

But for some domestic examples that are not as trascendental but are also examples of evil winning, there are tons of people who are adulterous, cons, corrupt, abusive- and yet they never get even arrested, their spouses never find out the cheating, some even become presidents or heads of state. Some of them fill arenas, get rewarded and so on. And many times their success is based on trickery and cheating up; but they are never discovered.

Reason why this happens? Simple: life is random just as everything else in the universe. We might try to feel better to think there is a god or a deity out there that will serve justice, or invent hell as a future punishment place should the evil person is never punished in their life.

Yes, it is hard, so hard to believe that I expect more downvotes and upvotes in this post. But it does not matter. Evil will still win sometimes, injustice will prevail in some cases, the only thing that we can say is that the more good you do the better the chances of being happy and successful, or the more bad you do the less likely you will end up being successful. But sometimes good people end up unfairly while some bad people who have a great, successful life. If you think they won’t because of their conscience? Bad people don’t care about morals, ethics or dignity. They simply survive by any means even if it means hurting people, and no, they don’t care, they are incapable of feeling remorse.

religion,Symbolism of Horses,"In a ritual sense, in the Vedic world, horses carried greater importance than the cows or any other animals. Horses were used in sacrifices, in warfare, travel, and probably trade and commerce. In the Vedic tradition, horses symbolize speed, beauty, purity, the expansive power of Brahman, freedom, grace, and strength. The Asvins, who symbolize the divinity of horses, are extolled in the Vedas as the gods who rescue people when they are caught in accessible places or lost in wilderness. In Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the sacrificial horse is compared to Brahman, with each of its bodily parts representing a particular aspect of him. In the Hindu or Vedic calendar, the Star Asvini and the month Asyayuja are popular terms related to horses. The twin gods, Asvins, were excellent horsemen and proven physicians. They implanted a horse head on a sage to save him from a curse. During the churning of the oceans a white horse arose from the waters which was gifted to Indra. Indian folk tales refer to horses that could fly to heaven, and horses that possessed wings. The Sun god, Surya, goes on his daily tour of the heavens from the East to the West on a chariot driven by horses. The Horse sacrifice was an important Vedic ritual during the Vedic period, in which kings used to make offerings to gods, expressing their gratitude for their success and victories in wars and conquests. Wild horses were tamed and used in warfare, rather than agriculture since they were expensive and difficult to maintain. There is no unanimity among scholars whether horses were native to India or imported from outside. Hindus worship Hayagriva, an incarnation of Vishnu who has the head of a horse and who played an important role in saving the Vedas during a conflict with the demons. Horse riding was an important art and martial skill in ancient India. Even women from noble families used to practice it. Horses are used in Hindu marriages to carry the bridegroom to the marriage platform. Horses are associated with many Hindu deities as vehicles such as Indra, Surya, Vayu, the Rudras, and Maruths.",1603263848.0

It's no wonder that so many people are so angry. 

It wasn't long ago that we were taught to have a positive attitude. In the workplace, negativity was a quick trip to a poor performance review. Preachers, motivational speakers and authors were preaching the doctrine of positive thinking. By contrast today, we are taught to search out injustice in every cranny that it can be found and to spread protest, riot, and destruction, until every last bit of injustice has been rooted out. 

Philippians 4:8 KJV says: ""Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."" 

Therefore, if our minds are constantly focused on negative things, we will be miserable, angry, and generally unhappy, but if we focus on what is true, honest, just, pure, and lovely, there is a far better chance that we will be well adjusted and happy despite whatever setbacks there might be and our life's outcomes will be more positive.

I couldn't imagine myself living a life lacking in so much diversity. No books other than the Bible? Only gospel music and no other genre? No hobbies other than church-related activities? That sounds so dull to me.

Of course, surely evangelicals have jobs, which means they're doing things OTHER than going to church.

religion,Historical inconsistency/Anachronism in the Quran,"Before I begin I would like to again mention that my posts are not intended to disgrace Islam in any way, I have lots of respect for Muslims and their beliefs. These are my own observations and do not necessarily indicate an absolute truth.

In Surah Ghafir, Ayat 36, (40:36) we read the following:

&gt; وَقَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ يَا هَامَانُ ابْنِ لِي صَرْحًا لَّعَلِّي أَبْلُغُ الْأَسْبَاب   
&gt;  
&gt; ""And Pharaoh said, “O Haman, build me a tower, that I may reach the pathways.""

In Surah Ghafir, Ayat 37, (40:37) we read:

&gt; أَسْبَابَ السَّمَاوَاتِ فَأَطَّلِعَ إِلَىٰ إِلَٰهِ مُوسَىٰ وَإِنِّي لَأَظُنُّهُ كَاذِبًا وَكَذَٰلِكَ زُيِّنَ   
&gt;  
&gt; لِفِرْعَوْنَ سُوءُ عَمَلِهِ وَصُدَّ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَمَا كَيْدُ فِرْعَوْنَ إِلَّا فِي تَبَاب   
&gt;  
&gt; ""The pathways of the heavens, so that I may glance at the God of Moses; though I think he is lying.” Thus Pharaoh’s evil deeds were made to appear good to him, and he was averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was only in defeat.""

The issue with these verses in the Surah is that it takes the Pharaoh from the times of Moses (approx 1300 BC) and Haman, (approx 355 BC) and implies that the two people had a conversation. However, these two people lived *nearly 1000 years apart* (and **2200 km apart**) which is problematic for the Quran and it's self-proclaimed validity as the pure and perfectly preserved word of God.

In my opinion, I believe this was another fault in which Mohammed confused Haman as the advisor of Pharaoh rather than the advisor of Ahaseures, King of *Persia.* 

There is a counter-argument to this claim, made famous by Dr. Maurice Bucaille. Bucaille claims that the name Haman actually appears in Egyption hieroglyphics, proving that Haman was actually Pharaohs advisor. However, the transliteration does not really suggest the name Haman at all. Bucaille uses a transliteration from Hermann Ranke, an Egyptologist. The transliteration can be found [here](https://www.answering-islam.org/authors/katz/haman/bucaille.html). When we look at the transliteration, we see that it actually spells out ""hmn-**H"".** This suggests that Bucaille's claim is largely inconclusive and the transliteration does not actually signal anything regarding Haman himself. It looks like Bucaille was simply trying to find anything *remotely* resembling the name Haman.

EDIT: I should also definitely mention that Haman is a Babylonian name and not an Egyptian name.",1599075099.0
religion,Know why were religions created.," It seems that religions were formed when groups of people accepted the theology and philosophy of their saints or sages regarding a belief system to pray to God. Religions are needed to organize faith and prayer and to make our relationship with God more effective. Imagine if a child is born without any religion, how would the child ever know the meaning of God? How would the new entrant into this world comprehend the power that created life and everything on the planet? As kids, whether we are Hindus, Muslims or Christians, religion plays an important role in igniting faith and building our theological foundation of spirituality. While most of the beliefs of a religion may be mythological, the principles behind religions are founded on very sincere objectives of connecting man with God. However, as time passed, man started following religious dogmas, rituals, and superstitions more than the founding principles and teachings of the religion. While this is unfortunate, it is definitely better than a scenario where we are lost without religion and not taught to accept and believe in God. Religion is a kindergarten to spirituality. All religions ignite our faith in God and teach us the basics. It is then for us to evolve, grow and transcend from being religious to being spiritual. Each one of us has an intellect and it is up to us to use this power of discrimination to pick the foundations of our religious beliefs and to knit it into a peaceful and blissful spiritual philosophy for our life.",1598523316.0
religion,Question no one has been able to answer about Christianity,"So I have always had a question that no one has been able to answer. I have asked many priests, teachers from my Catholic school (which I attended grades 3-12), and religious friends. Basically, we know through that our species evolved through the process of evolution by natural selection. This is a scientific fact that is not up for debate. Now, my question pertains to quotes by Jesus in light of this revelation. Jesus states ""But from the beginning of creation, ""God made them male and female.' **7** ""For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, **8** and the two shall become one flesh."" (Mark 10:6-8). This quote is scientifically inaccurate because, if there was a God who participated in evolution, he would have helped create a single common ancestor from which all of life descends from, not creating a male and a female (clearly referencing the myth of Adam and Eve). The other quote that Jesus says is about Noah, ""As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man"" (Matthew 24:37). This is obviously wrong since Noah didn't actually happen due to many impossibilities, ""tens of millions on a man-made boat by a 300 year old man, salt/fresh water mixing, etc.). Basically, my question is that how can we resolve the scientific inaccuracies in Jesus' own words if we are to believe he is divine in any way? Why would he say something that contradicts modern science which can lead to more doubt and unbelief? All of the people who I have asked have either: a) wiggled out of answering it by saying we can't know God's will, or b) that Noah/Garden of Eden actually did literally happen (if you say that, then I know you know nothing about modern science and shows your ignorance only more)",1598133492.0

religion,Are Tithes Still Applicable Today?,"Answer: First, let’s understand what is tithes, it simply means the tenth part or 10%, it’s a mathematical measurement, thus it will always be applicable. Now, what is not applicable or better yet not doable today? Believe it, what is not doable is actually the very commandment of God about 10% or tithes, if one force it, instead of obedience, one will transgress the law thus sinning.

What is the commandment of God relating to 10% that is impossible to comply as commanded?

“I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting.” Numbers‬ ‭18:21‬ ‭NIV‬‬

As you read above, tithes were given to Levites. In Mal 3:10 which read,

“Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.” Malachi‬ ‭3:10‬ ‭NIV‬‬

The ones who will bring the tithes to storehouse were also Levites as mentioned below;

“A priest descended from Aaron is to accompany the Levites when they receive the tithes, and the Levites are to bring a tenth of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the storerooms of the treasury.” Nehemiah‬ ‭10:38‬ ‭NIV‬‬

So, it is clear above that the tithes as commanded was to be collected by Levites. Now, in the interpretation of the bible, we have this so-called parallelism, whereby, we parallel an event or group of people to today’s time so that it becomes applicable.

The parallelism of Levites as preached by most churches today are Pastors or Preachers since they supposedly assume the function of Levites in the old testament, thus since Levites are entitled to the tithes, it follows that Pastor’s / Preacher’s also are entitled to it. Personally this makes sense to me, but the problem is that, we read that Levites were changed in the below verse;

“If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.” Hebrews‬ ‭7:11-12‬ ‭NIV‬‬

So now, since Levites were changed stripping them from their function of the priesthood, it follows that their obligation to collect tithes which were due to the priesthood was also stripped. You would not resign someone from their function yet still be obliged to pay them right? Since this is the case, it follows that the Pastor’s/Preachers who parallel themselves to Levites also lose that duty or obligation to collect tithe.

Now, does this mean that Pastor’s are not entitled to some right or privilege to be supported? No, the right is still there but it is not their duty anymore to collect tithe. When you say duty, whether you like it or not, you are obliged to collect it otherwise you are disobeying God, this is no more. In short, though Pastors/Preacher still has the privilege to be supported, they ought not to oblige anyone to support them, moreover, they also ought to follow the apostles on what they have done to this privilege as below;

“For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.” 2 Thessalonians‬ ‭3:7-10‬ ‭NIV‬‬

So you see, they set themselves as a model to imitate, they work rather than be a burden to anybody. If you are a preacher of the word, yet you are not following apostles example, shame on you!

religion,Religion = Role-playing?,"Okay so this is my first post on this sub. 

I am an atheist. I am not here to push my atheism nor am I condescending towards those who do practice a faith/belief/religion.  I believe in freedom and freewill and people making their own choices and way in life. I also would like to state that I am not here to be prosteletized, only interested in an idea and a discussion about this offhand idea. 

A random thought occured to me about the way people practice/espouse religion and religious texts as factual with no ""scientific proof"", meaning objective observation using the scientific method. 

I likened it to Dungeons and Dragons(DnD) in my mind and toyed with the idea of role-playing and belief.

When I played DnD with a fantastic DM (dungeon master) who was a gifted orator and storyteller/world builder, I was so enthralled in the collective imagined experience of our group I truly, while only for a short while, believed in the characters and world being portrayed by our DM and us. 

Again I want to state I am not belittling or goading anyone or any group for their religious practices or beliefs, I just was curious as to how people of faith would respond to the idea of collective imagined experiences such as role-playing being compared to a religious faith. 

Please be civil, and if you believe me to be malicious with this proposal, this post is not for you. I know this is the internet and trolls are a plenty but I am genuinely ponderous of this idea and would love to hear your feedback.

religion,God's right to kill?,"I've seen many arguments justifying God and his actions for murder with ""he's God, he made us so he can kill us""

I find this ridiculous as we did not ask to be made and live, we also didn't ask to die, so why does God have the right kill us?

What I find that makes this worse is how God gave us free will, it's as though he wants us to break the rules, God is all powerful so would it not be easier for him just to take away the part of our free will that makes us ""sin"" so he doesn't need to send us to hell to he tortured for all of eternity by Satan, a creature he made 

So what does give God the right to kill us, does him being God make it okay? Or is there something I've missed

religion,detailed introduction to Semdaeism,"Hello! I am the Semdaen arrikirri which makes me the head and founder of Semdaeism. In the past I have made several smaller introductions to Semdaeism but I feel they were too vague and didn't give a proper understanding of the religion. So I will use this time to make a much fuller and more detailed introduction to the faith while also making sure I answer some of the more asked questions, show how to be a Semdaen and dispel the misunderstandings around my faith.

Firstly, what is Semdaeism? The Semdaen religion is a polytheistic religion that takes an Omnic standpoint on the existence of the gods and believes that all of the gods exist at once, this isn't anything special amongst polytheistic faiths, however Semdaeism itself worships a different pantheon of deities named the 'Kono. The 'Kono are not gods, but rather people who had become godlike by the judgment of a creator deity named Pono, the crow. This is a important doctrine in Semdaeism and often leads to people thinking I am belittling the gods, this is not true as the gods are still considered extremely important, but ultimately subservient to the 'Kono and the king who we will get to later.

Now the 'Kono act a lot like gods, in short terms, due to the gods warring with themselves and with demons it plunged the world into chaos and the king of the gods Dyeus Phter had lost control. Then two creator deities came to the world and segregated the gods and installed the 'kono to police the world and keep it under control. They do eventually lose control and leave Earth for a while to come back later, through me. But that is not important. There are various 'Kono, they come from many backgrounds and areas in the world and have various temperaments and laws. These Laws are often on things such as drinking and eating along with social manners etc. Apart from the actual religious laws of the faith which are concrete, the laws from 'Kono are often varied and change on which 'kono is the Cultic (Patron/Matron) 'Kono. The Punishment for breaking these laws are often dealt with by the 'kono as well. I mentioned that there are Cultic 'Kono, the Semdaen religion has a system similar to the patron and matron gods and goddesses of other Polytheistic faiths. This being you have a wider Cultic 'Kono/s that you worship directly and a personnel 'Kono that acts as a guardian angel figure, this 'kono will act as your protector on day to day life and is separate from other guardian angel figures but works with them. The personnel 'kono was acting as your guardian from your birth and will continue to guard you all of your life. Cultic 'Kono represent themselves various animals and beasts, such as bears, boars etc. In artworks that have religious connotations, made by me, the animals are used to represent various 'Kono who are then used to represent various concepts such as life death, love and war. This is important because in the place of true idols for the 'Kono which show them as how they look you can instead use an animal statue in its place for Worship. The 'kono that are minor govern other many things such as the rocks, hills, trees and mountains. They exist too in the cycle of worship and reverence, especially high ranking minor 'Kono will inhabit various grand structures and as such deserve reverence the most. Therefore we have a system that is very similar to the Kami system in Shintoism.

The Next largest part of Semdaeism is the king, before I became the Arrikirri I got involved with the cult of king Arthur. I carry this belief into Semdaeism, the king is a central messianic figure in the faith, he is said to come back and turn the world into a golden age after he combines all the worlds religion into one religion. He has been declared king of the gods, of man, of the beasts and birds and even of the demons of the world, what does not bow shall bow to the king. He has servants, these servants are normally kings and generals that have achieved glory and fame and in some way had impressed the Lords and the gods in such a way that they had achieved enlightenment and went straight into the kings court, these people are normally not Semdaen themselves but of other religions and had unlocked Semdaen virtue, an example of a servant would Decebalus last king of Dacia. These servants are known by the name of Regs, they help kings and generals in certain situations but will also help the general public. They are like the Catholic Saints if you are still having trouble understanding.

The way to become a Semdaen is to simply prepare an Altar in the Semdaen way, which is simple but can be somewhat costly depending on the quality you want for your Altar. To create an Altar you need to first find a space for it, a bench is the best way to achieve this space. The next thing you need to do is get a larger clothe to cover the entire space, this clothe is called the Plarom. The next thing you need to do is add another much smaller and thinner clothe to put in the middle called the Klijo, it must be wide enough to fit a few statues in and long enough to go across the entire space. On the Klijo you need to place three items, an Idol of your Cultic 'Kono, an Idol of the king and an Idol of your Personnel 'Kono. The next Item you need to place is in front of the clothe and needs to be the Srwos which is a candle holder in the shape of a peacock meant to represent Melek Tawes, the defender of humanity. The Ancestors Skull or the Strutjos is next, placed to the right of the Srwos which should be on the far left. On the far right should be the Donom which is the Libations bowl Finally inbetween the Strutjos and the Srows is the Asis which is a offering urn for things like paper prayer. Behind the klijo you can place the images of other gods for worship. Finally one of the most important parts is the Asajos or Altar sword, this is almost always a real sword, however if there is any reason you legally or financially cannot own sword there are alternatives such as Paper swords or less dangerous training swords.

There are several sacred things into Semdaeism, the numbers eight and four, blood, foxes and Kashmiri cypresses are all considered sacred things. The 'kono of sacred thing and blood, Vestpus represents himself as foxes. Along with that there are the two temples, the Domos and the Yageh. The Domos is considered the most important out of the two, they are made to look like hills or mountains and they contain eight kinds of rooms. The main hall, the sacred well, the room for the Native god, a room for sword smithing, a main worshipping room which has a oven for baking offerings, a tomb or sacred grave for the priests that double as a ancestor worship room and finally a room for some more minor cultic practises. Along with this stands a idol modeled after the Shigir idol which represents the 'kono of the temple and a protector and a Menhir which details certain events that take place during the construction. There is also Kashmiri Cypresses on the top as the top of the complex is covered in dirt and it is surrounded by native fruit trees and other native plants you can eat, these will be farmed in times of emergency. Domos should be sanctified with first a blood offering and some minor rituals, if the Domos is in a larger area as it should be then a game of Polo should take place to properly make it sacred in the eyes of Vestpus. The other structure is the Yageh, which is the main home for the native god, the native god or the gnos if you wish, is a idol of a god that is native to the region *Like Zeus or Heracles for Greece* and is made in the native art style. He gets two holidays, the day of the gods where he is taken from the Domos to the Yageh representing him being apart from the 'kono but still worshipped *The parade is a four hour trip* and then the peach parade where he is taken back to the Domos *Representing princess Hurkino joining the 'kono as their princess after being abandoned by her fellow gods* The Yagehs are built in the style of the native architecture either in the shape of houses or in the shape of granary representing the god is there for their people. Another factor of Semdaeism is that there are the seven heavenly isles where either an important religious event happened or they have a section of Semdaeism within their religion. these isles are as follows, Britian, Japan, the Carribian, Malta, New Zealand and the Canary isles. These I hope will have some of the first Domos and Yagehs.

The next thing I would like to talk about is enlightenment, the Semdaen enlightenment comes in two forms, Bhilis, the right handed enlightenment and the Pavillion Leaf Path, the left handed enlightenment which leads to a form of immortality but is widely hidden or unknown, Clergy and Successor Arrikirris do not take this path but instead take a form of enlightenment reserved for clergy called Itrdae which is a special form of the Leuk path when the clergy devotes themselves to the lords and the king. Bhilis is a very long process and revolves heavily around the concept of the cycle and reincarnation, the result of this is that you must achieve eight forms of lesser enlightenment through each of the eight heavenly laws which I will go over. In each eight you must achieve the lesser enlightenment or Gnowa. the laws go as follow:

* Nos, the law of North America, that one must be of their community, know and speak the native language and the popular language, move in the ways of the native culture and the popular culture and bow and pray to the Native, Semdaen and popular gods, unless it is the Yahweh of Abraham.
* Mer, the law of Ocenia, that one must understand that all things live through the cycle that is birth, life, sacrifice (Literal and figurative), death and rebirth and that even the animals, to live through this cycle and that slaughter is their sacrifice to us, that man does not harm or act inappropriately to the animal even during slaughter and even after death.
* Deh, the law of Africa, that one must realise that the Lystche ancestor spirits watch over their families and their lands and that they are forever listening to our every word and our every action, that no matter what we must be respectful of the dead and not speak ill of them nor insult them with our actions.
* Leuk, the law of India, that one must understand that the gods are ever present and ever helpful beings but they are still gods, they are the highers and we are the lowers. We are of not right or will to insult our heavenly lords with images of them as cartoons nor slander their name of deeds with such casualty.
* Webh, the law of Asia, that one must understand that above all else, the lords be they gods, demons or 'kono are beloved of those things which are creative above all else, be it art, writing, music or answering the simple question.
* Heug, the law of South America, that one must be virtous above all else, even without acting in gnowa. The lords are watching constantly and so to do good deeds and to act in all the manners and be kind is above all else when they watch.
* Gwhen, the law of Europe, that one most be aware of the Asajos as one must be aware of the king as a warlord, this world is a violent one for that is a form of the cycle ever since peace came into being and that to obtain virtous too is to obtain skill in the sword and skill in the hand.
* Wied, the law of Antartica, that one must be knowledgeable for the ultimate sin is ignorance, that you must live in the great and constant state of learning and knowledge, you must be a scholar above all others and your simple breathe contains more information then even the great libraries. It should be noted that these laws are not really true laws in the sense that you can break them easily, with exception such as Leuk and Deh but rather the eight most important guidelines and eight different ways of reaching enlightenment. I do not decide whether you reach this enlightenment nor are they levelled against each other but rather equal to one and another. After achieving gnowa eight different times (Normally taking eight or more different lives to complete) you become what is known as a Mereg who is an enlightened king or general where upon death you will become a god and begin to serve the king in his court, for only those that are great can serve that which is the greatest.

A confusing part of Semdaeism seems to be the Arrikirris, as some people confuse me to be the only Arrikirri, that is not true. I am the Arrikirri of the four pointed star which makes me the first of my fellow Arrikirris of the heaven of the four pointed star. There they wait in line to incarnate, my job is simply to found the religion and set up some early organisation in the faith. Each Arrikirri will atleast write eight books to add to the holy text before their death. Arrikirris do not have an extreme authority over a Semdaen, it would be good to tell one you're becoming Semdaen so that they can help you and get an idea of numbers in the faith and demographics but it is not needed. Additionally any issue you have with clergy can be brought up to a Semdaen Arrikirri and he will try to mitigate the issue, Semdaeism also relies on UPG and Arrikirris, especially me, will try to check up on you to see how everything is going with your faith and learn more from what you have learnt while worshipping. There is also no ill will towards anyone that leaves, I might get upset, sad or angry for a bit but I will not hold a grudge against anyone that leaves and I hope all other Semdaens will be this kind.

In Semdaeism there is two calendars, the sixteen heavenly days calendar *Noichos* for the sixteen holidays of Semdaeism and the Zodiac calendar *Alkis* these two calendars are important, I'm not going to show them in this post but maybe another post because then it will be far too long. Now the Zodiacs in Semdaeism function as a form of totemism, as the lesser Zodiac, the animal Zodiac has an animal for each of the twelve months. Depending on which month you are born you have a different animal, these animals represent the Xenematres who are the lords of the months and if you see your totemic animal it means goodluck. You must also deny the meat of this animal. The greater zodiac is about worship, the greater zodiac creatures are often beasts and coincide with the year you were born in. These beasts are often used to represent your personnel 'kono and they are placed on the Altar right next to your Cultic 'Kono.

I will leave some of the more frequently asked questions below:

* Does the religion have a central text Yes, if you ask I will send you what I currently have (The text is unfinished)
* How old is the religion/how many followers do I have/ how old am I Not very old, not that many followers
* Is Homosexuality a sin No, unless you're a king or queen, then adopt a child before you ascend to the throne
* Is Abortion allowed Yes, if the child is born from rape, it isn't a plan B

That is all for now, I will update the questions and the post in general and resend it if I have anything else to add or any more commonly asked questions pop up. I would like to be able to work with the community so I can better express myself amongst you so that I don't seem so dangerous to some.

religion,God is One??,"God is One say the Muslims. But only worldly things can be one or many. God created all things, so He is not a 'thing' himself. Thus, we can neither say that He is One nor that He is Many. 

The symbol of the Trinity says that God is One and Three. As the worldly intellect understands only worldly things, the Trinity does not make logical sense to us. This is good. It means that the symbol functions as a pointer to the transcendent God. By meditating on the Trinity we can transcend the one and the many.

In Christian theology, God has one will, because He is a personal God. So He has not many conflicting wills. The Persons of the Trinity have not the self-willed personhood of the human kind. The hypostases have one will. 

God is *simplex* and not *complex*. But the sentence ""God is One"" makes one think that He is one in the metaphysical sense (as if He were a 'thing'). This is wrong. We cannot know this, because God transcends our worldly concepts.

The conclusion is that the Trinity is a superior symbol of God.",1584981087.0
religion,Covid-19 As A Silver Lining,"Baha’is all over our world are going through the sacred process of fasting right now. We do not eat or drink from sunrise to sunset for a period of 19 days.￼  Personally, this is a time of reflection, meditation, prayer, discipline and spiritual transformation.  I feel a sense of calm and peace even though I recognize that outside the walls of my home, there are a lot of Souls presently feeling anxiety and uncertainty for their futures￼.  

This is where faith comes in; a belief that regardless of what is going on outside of oneself, a connection to that light within us—our Soul—can guide us and inspire us to transcend above the prevailing fear￼ and listen to that 
inner voice that ALL of us possess, regardless of our outside affiliations.  ￼Our inner voice, our Soul, will guide us if we do not let our fears drown it out.  ￼￼Fear has its place in our lives but fear and faith cannot abide in the heart at the same time and we have a choice as to which one we feed.  ￼

We really are not that different from 
one another￼.  An incredible number of things unite us: we all have families; blood courses throughout our veins; we feel pain, loneliness, hope, and joy; yet our Planet IS the one major unifier for all of us.  She is our Teacher and She is our Mother￼.   

Crisis leads to Victory when we work together.  Now,  today, (March 15, 2020), while this current crisis and momentum is increasing, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, CAPACITY, AND RESPONSIBILITY to educate humanity regarding the Interconnectedness of all sentient beings, and ultimately the Interconnectedness we share with our beautiful Mother Earth. 

Whether we realize it or not, abuses on one part of the planet can gradually affect us everywhere, Covid-19 being a powerful and acute example.  None of us are immune to these challenges. Yet powerfully, all of us can benefit by being properly educated, proactive, and conscious of these conditions and applying common sense and consideration for others.  

If we, as one humanity, can successfully come together to put a stop to the spread of Covid-19, what is stopping us from collectively working together to protect the very planet that nurtures us?  I believe Covid-19 is a blessing in disguise as well as a rehearsal for more challenging events to come IF WE DO NOT ACT NOW.  It is up to US and our institutions (governments, health care, religions, military, legal, communities, etc.) to collectively respond in a just and conscious manner.  Do unto our Mother Earth as we would want done to ourselves because ultimately, we will pay a great price in the end if we don’t￼.  And that would be Her justice.

religion,Jesus is the worship of the Sun,"Hello guys, today I present the best kept secret of human history-How Jesus is a myth to represent the sun and how the political establishment wanted to historicalize the figure for control over people and disconnect them

Spiritually is part of our evolutionary instincts, we feel connected to nature and people in a special way to make us feel special and spiritual. The ancient people knew this, and represented it mostly through a series of Gods to represent nature, the most important God, or the Messiah, the savor, is the Sun. The Sun rose very morning giving light, warmth and security to the people of the world, expelling the darkness that for hundreds of thousands of years was the natural enemy of man.

So, the Sun was adored and worshiped in different ways. The important one is to see the path of the sun through the winter solstice to the Spring Equinox to the Summer Solstice and then the sun going down to the winter solstice. This represented a general story of the sun being born after the Winter Solstice(December 25th, coincidence?) getting stronger and then going tragically down hill and the sun ""dying"" to the darkness on December 21st, the shortest day of the year, but alas! the sun is reborn again 3 days later to begin the process of it's orbit again! it is rebirth

This is the story of Jesus. Most historians know that Jesus was born in a cave and began his ministry at age 30 after being baptized, the story of Jesus takes place in one year according to some denominations, particularly older ones, the suns journey is also one year, Jesus's high point in his story  is the Summer Solstice when Jesus was on the highest mountain, then the story begins to slowly go downhill, just like how the sun theoretically ""dies"" after.

The Sun gets weaker and weaker in the fall, until on December 22nd, it dies, it is crucified. This is where the constellations play a part, at night, the ancient people had nothing to do except look at stars and tell stories about them such as Aquarius the water bearer, the person who brings the spring rains. These constellations have nothing to do with the stars but the seasons and what happens, the Pisces constellation represents a time for fishing in March when hunting and harvesting hasn't begun yet.

So the idea of dying on a cross is a reference to the constellation Crux, the southern cross, Romans didn't crucify people on a cross very often, if not at all, most were either buried alive, beheaded or sent to an arena, but the constellation of a cross gave the people an idea, the cross is also the center of the Zodiac, or the suns path around constellations. Then, the sun is dead for 3 days, December 22nd,23rd, and the 24th. So it was written, the sun died on a cross and then on December 25th, it is resurrected and the cycle beings when Jesus is born in a cave and resurrected in a cave. This is evident in many scripture passages as well as there is no historical evidence that Jesus even existed

 [John 8:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=john+8:12) When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, ""I am the light of the world."" (The ""light of the world"" is the Sun.)  
[John 9:5](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=john+9:5) While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. (The ""light of the world"" is the Sun.)  
[Matthew 4:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=matthew+4:16) The people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."" (The light is the Sun)  
[Matthew 17:2](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=matthew+17:2) His face shone like the sun, and *his clothes* became as white as *the light*. [Psalms 84:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=psalms+84:11) ""the Lord God is a sun...""  
[Deuteronomy 4:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=deuteronomy+4:24) ""For the LORD your God is a consuming fire,"" (the Sun is a consuming fire.) 

This is the truth, every SUNday, people worship the Sun, or Jesus. Spiritually is meant to be connected to nature, and Jesus is a allegory for the sun and it's natural properties like his crown of thorns, those are sun rays. So, it is a myth but people try to historicalize it for social and political control of the people,to get tax cuts and produce 1.2 TRILLION dollars every year for the U.S and the Vatican",1584199733.0
religion,"With all due respect to people of all religions, I would like to ask a serious question regarding a link between Schizophrenia and creation of religions.","To start with, I am no scholar and this is not an ideology am trying to impose, it’s simply something that I thought about. It’s also not exclusive to Abrahamic religions either, hence I also ask the question was the Bhudda possibly schizophrenic? But I will be speaking about Abrahamic religions as I know more about them. 

Let’s start with Islam, please bare with me my Muslim friends. 
 
Now Mohamed (PBUH if you’re Muslim) was an outcast before the message, he frequented a cave in Mount Nour to sit by himself and question life. What do we know of Mohamed before Islam? Well he was an orphan, and was outcasted as a kid, he was a hardworker, and overall lead a very stressful life. Secondly, his first wife, Khadija, was possibly Christian, since her cousin, was a Nestorian priest, it is possible that Mohamed had very good knowledge of Christian teaching through his wife, and given his time alone in the cave, might have experienced psychosis regarding Gabriel.

Now comes Jesus (Christ almighty if you’re Christian), we know that the inhabitants of Nazareth were a bit extreme with religion, so this already solves on where did he get the ideas of Gabriel and etc. We also know that the circumstances of his birth remain a mystery, and since Mary was very young when she conceived him, it’s not unlikely for a child to develop mental illness in other circumstances. 

Now most Jewish prophets were related, so the ideas behind Gabriel and possible mental health would be passed down. Moses in particular strikes because he has several issues growing up, like speech impediment, and let’s not forget he was exposed to violence as a child. 

We can even go back and talk about Abraham, who received the message at a very old age, possibly 100+, could it be that, Abrahamic religions are the making of an old man with psychosis and got passed down for thousands of generations?

Let’s discuss that shall we? :D, I’d love to learn more!!

I do wish that there was a god and I like the idea of one but I do not think it is scientifically possible or plausible. Sometimes I find myself wishing I believed in a god but deep down I just can't believe it's at all possible and tend to think of it as a children's tale similar to Santa Claus.


I hope I didn't offend anyone here I'm just seeking some guidance to find a belief that best suits me.

religion,"God as an Artificial Intelligence (NOT a Futurist Post / NOT Related to the ""Singularity"")","A famous researcher of AI (cannot recall who right now) once claimed that we already have artificial intelligence, it's called ""the corporation"". It's an artificial entity, that doesn't have a body that can be localized anywhere, yet it somehow seems to have agency and autonomy, and has already attained dominance in society.  It doesn't use ""chips"", but it uses wetware, human brains, to run it's software.  It's like a software (network) that exists  through many ""hardware stations"" (brains) that run it: employees, stakeholders, managers, stock traders etc.  Thus its artificial life is sustained.  
I wonder if anybody has tried exploring the idea of ""god"" in a similar way: as an abstract entity that runs on the collective hardware (cloud of wetwere/brains).  This 'software' is like an operating system that is installed on a new unit (brain).  It is not allowed to change this software in principle, but there are very rare exception (""prophets"", ""apostles"", etc.) that are allowed to make edits to the software, or even create new versions/forks.  In this sense, god exists, just as corporations exists.  I don't subscribe to the idea that only physical objects exists.  The  *United East India Company*  was/is an existing object.  In this way, god 'speaks to people's minds' as the software that runs on their hardware (brains) and is seen as a favorable upgrade compared to the natural state that hardware runs on ('the fallen state').

religion,Why “Happy Feet” Represents Religious Extremism,"When you think of the movie Happy Feet, you probably picture a bunch of silly, happy and entertaining, dancing penguins. This would make sense. Some people would argue that Happy Feet is an Anti-Religious propaganda film that no one should ever encourage or listen to. Others would argue that these people didn’t know what they’re talking about, and that Happy Feet is extremely boring and uninteresting, and others would say that Happy Feet is an excellent messages and entertainment. It is really fun with amazing songs, dancing sequences and awesome actors such as Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman and Elijah Wood. 
However, when you start to pay closer attention to the movie you may realize what religious symbolism is used in the movie. What exactly makes me think this, you ask? Well, I’ll tell you. 
I’ll start from the very beginning of the film. After the Mumbles parents (Hugh Jackman &amp; Nicole Kidman) meet each other, there is a scene with all of the emperor penguins huddling for warmth, while the main religious elders worship the “Great Guin,” their God who brings the fish. The religious high class has a penguin known as Noah The Elder (Hugo Weaving).  When huddling for warmth, Mumble (Elijah Wood) is dropped, and this causes him to look different and like tap dancing. When he dances his heart out, Norma Jean admires him, but Memphis is concerned. Even the elders start to notice. When he grows up, he starts to have feelings for a childhood friend of his, Gloria (Brittany Murphy) and adore her. Like Norma Jean, Gloria also admires Mumbles tap dancing. At the graduation, Noah explains that the penguins even have an explanation for evolution, or how they came to be. He ventures off and finds Adelie penguins such as Ramon (Robin Williams) and accept him for who he is. Lovelace (Robin Williams) tells him about the disappearing food population. Mumble returns to emperor land and tries to get his crush, Gloria. When Mumble brings his tap dancing obsession to the emperor Penguin colony, Noah and the elders have him banished for being different and not finding their soulmates through song. They have him banished and blame him for the food shortage. He sets off to find it, and comes across the humans. When he follows them and gets trapped into a zoo, he tap dances to impress the humans and is sent back. He tap dances to save the food population and the elders try to deny it. When they find acceptance, they save the population and it’s a happy ending. 
As you can see, throughout this movie, these penguin elders try to discriminate Mumble from being different, just like many religious extremists. In our modern world, they still exist heavily, such as ISIS and many other religions. Happy Feet gives great insight into things like religious cults and global warming, and try to tell people it’s okay to be yourself. 
This is why I love this movie so much. It gives great messages that we still need in our modern world. If you made it this far, thank you for reading because this took a while to write. Anyways, enjoy your day.",1580003924.0

religion,I found God.,"The first cause (God or w/e) is not an all encompassing being, because not everything is made of the same stuff in the same way. However, the first cause gave everything the same purpose and direction in life. So it is not a being but rather it is an ism. If one were to give it a label it would be universalism, and the definition would be: everything exists for the sole purpose of exploration and experimentation, and these two activities causes the subsequent inventions that serve no other directions but to acquire stability and progress so long as life lasts. There are no other ways to have fun in life than to follow the first cause with a clear conscience. Otherwise, degeneration and/or mutation will occur automatically. There are no absolution for such ‘sins’, because the adverse effects are automatically applied to the perpetrators without mercy.  

Mercy is just a byword for apathy. It doesn’t even attempt to help solve the problems but instead it would rather let the problems become worst. Nor does it attempt to evaluate whether there was a problem to begin with since Mercy is working with a presupposition that wrong has been committed in a pragmatic way. The worst thing is that it demand recompense without judging whether the cost is reasonable, so the perpetrators are always susceptible to unfair judgments. Mercy is lazy, counter-productive, and tyrannical. It creates more and worst problems in the end. So the end doesn’t justify the means. Mercy can be replaced with conscience for greater efficiency. In effect it will always deliver positive results.  

Conscience is simply to prioritize the well-being of your own specie over all other species, do nothing to deliberately disturb the mental stability or hinder the social progression of an individual or as a collective, and remove everything that violate the second clause indiscriminately. The conscience become ineffective when these three natural fundamental laws are replaced with subjective laws that are interchangeable. Because these three natural fundamental laws is completely dependent on the workings of each individual law to be effective as a whole. So the slightest change in any one of these laws will put the human conscience to sleep altogether. Then mutation will occur and the adverse effects grow stronger as the conscience become more muddled.  

There are three factors in the world that will alter the conscience in negative ways: religion (pseudo facts), inheritance (excess and validation), and personality trends (intellectuals, rationalists, intp, istp, esfp, introvert, extrovert, etc.). Those who applied these three principles in their life will never attain mental stability. They are essentially living in the ego. And the ego spectrum goes from Perfectionism to Fear to Suicide. So they can’t gain any progress in life as a result.

In conclusion it is always in our best interests to be natural. We’re homo-sapiens, not monkeys nor apes nor chimps. This is what I got after a few years of research. 

I wish everyone a Merry Late Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Happy Holidays.

religion,I want to make my case for denying God the Creator as the Abrahamic religions describe him.,"Hello dear readers.  
 I want to make my case for denying God the Creator as the Abrahamic religions describe him.  
  So, if there were a God-Creator of the universe, a being of this  magnitude and power, by definition, would be absolutely perfect.  
 Can  an absolutely perfect being have any needs and desires? It is possible  to desire what there is no wishing, in what there is a need.  
 The Bible says that God created the world through love.  
 It is written in the Qur'an that Allah created the world, people and Jinn for people to worship him.  
 What is written in the Torah, for what reason the World was created, I do not know.  
  The need for creativity and vanity of gigantic proportions, these are  the main motives of the Gods of the old Testament and the Koran.  
 The  question arises. Can an absolutely perfect being capable and able to  create a huge universe, not just our Earth, experience such feelings?  
  I think, that any attempt to human comprehend God as personality,  inevitably will lead to giving God anthropomorphic traits (especially  rights).  
 If you watched cartoon Antts, then principle you will become clear. The main characters of the  
 cartoon-ants, given human traits of appearance and character.  
 People themselves have invented God, advertised the idea of his existence and together believe that God needs them.  
 Let us think and relate the scales of man and God.  
  Man is different from amoeba. What does an amoeba know about a person?  What does the dear reader think about this? Maybe an amoeba has the  right to take a man as God?  
 Further, if there were a God, his existence would be an axiom, that is, would need no proof for any of us humans.  
  Does anyone doubt that there is air? Would not God, in the  understanding of men, be more real than air? If there were a God, there  would be one religion in the World. Then the very idea of ""atheism"", as  such, would disappear because of insolvency. No one would doubt that the  space, the Earth and man was created by God. Just as no man doubts that  he was born of a father and mother.  
 Suppose that God exists. Where  is the evidence that any version of God's existence is true? Where in  the Bible are the proofs written that God exists?  
 The Qur'an  describes the acts of God. However, all acts of God are very similar to  self-promotion-on the principle of ""I am the best"".  
 How many people  would believe me if they saw me with a sign that said, ""I'm right  because I'm right, and if you don't believe me, you're a scoundrel and a  scoundrel""?  
 The cause of religion is fear. Fear in General, but mostly it's the fear of death.  
  Many centuries ago pagan priests frightened people with terrible  punishments after death. The hallucinations of the pagan priests of the  world Apocalypse were terrible.  
 Kings, princes and other rulers of  Nations used religion for their own purposes. Would God allow people who  were born equal to his will to be frightened, humiliated, oppressed, if  he existed?  
 Can God require a father to sacrifice his son to him? Can he be God who demands to kill a man?  
  The Bible says that God loves people. Let me ask you, if mothers have  genetically ill children, does this show God's love for people? If a  child is sexually assaulted by a mentally ill person or dies at the  hands of a murderer, is this a manifestation of God's love for people?  
  As an example. In 1995, during the first Chechen campaign, I met an  18-year-old boy whose mother was grabbed by armed Chechens in broad  daylight and shoved against her will into a car, taken out of town and  raped by a woman. After the rape, the young man's mother was severely  beaten. The woman from 35-year-old healthy and beautiful instantly  turned into an old woman with disabilities and lost her mind. Who of the  clergy will be able to tell the mother and son that God loves them? Who  can imagine how much hatred and heartache will keep a young man for  life after the events experienced?  
 It is not that God loves or dislikes people, it is that there is no God as the Abrahamic religions describe him.  
  Dear readers, I ask you to imagine that if a socially powerful person  began to patronize you, wouldn't your life become much easier? We would  always have good food, a big beautiful house, timely medical care,  tourist trips around the world and other bonuses.  
 You take care of relatives. You never tell them that "" tomorrow, tomorrow I will do everything tomorrow.""  
  The life of all people, regardless of religion, is full of all kinds of  suffering. The poor envy the rich, their wealth and are convinced of  their happiness. Rich people envy poor people who do not worry about how  to preserve and increase large capitals. Regardless of financial  status, all people age and die the same way.  
 The death of any person  becomes grief and suffering for loved ones and people who love him. Any  human joy quickly ends and is replaced by suffering.  
 Let's move on to practical things.  
  Christians believe that all who believe in their God will go to hell.  Any person who believes in the Christian God with good or bad deeds  after his death will go to Heaven. If a noble man does not believe in a  Christian God, he will only go to Hell after death.  
 Muslims hold similar beliefs.  
 Dear followers of Christianity and Islam,  
  why are you convinced that your Paradise is interesting for all people?  The Vikings ' Paradise is Valhalla. In Paradise, the Vikings staged  military tournaments, enjoyed abundant food and drank a lot of  intoxicating wine. From the point of view of Buddhism, Viking Paradise  is a natural hell!  
 What can Christians offer me as a Paradise? Sit  on a cloud with a harp in your hands and flap your wings like an angel? I  remember the plot of the cartoon ""Ice age part 3"". In this cartoon  squirrel goes to heaven and meets God in the form of a giant acorn. This  cartoon and the plot makes me smile.  
 I appeal to you Muslims. Do  you think I'm interested in 72 virgin girls in your idea of Paradise?  Where will 72 virgin Muslim girls appear in Paradise for every devout  Muslim? What to do in the future with these girls? Your idea of Heaven  makes me laugh.  
 It does not occur to representatives of Abrahamic  religions that people have different ideals and ideas. There are people  who like ice cream, beer and dried fish, orange juice, roast pork. All  people have different tastes. We recognize and are comfortable with the  diversity of people's food cravings.  
 I want to ask you,  representatives of Abrahamic religions, why you do not assume that every  person on Earth, regardless of religious preferences, is worthy of  simple human happiness?  
 I'm not a master of words. Please forgive me if my thoughts have some confusion. ""

• Likewise, if you hold atheism as a psychological state theism must be held as one too to avoid special pleading. 

• Even genius atheists respected in philosophy, like William Rowe, know you can come to different conclusions than them and still be reasonable and intelligent. 

• The USSR's crimes were absolutely driven by atheism and anti theism. Also this says nothing about atheism being inherently bad, so there's no reason to ignore this. If you tend to think things like ""the crusades were bad so Christianity is bad"", its that logic which is flawed, not that people using X evilly makes X evil. 

• Literally everyone has faith and banks on it to live their daily lives. Faith does not mean without/ against reason and evidence, the proper term for that is fideism.

religion,Is this a simulation?,"I would love to start a discussion about the theory that our existence itself is a simulation. This life is filled with positives and negatives. Like hot and cold, life and death, day and night, Male and female, matter and energy. or love and hate.  All seemingly opposite things. If you have ever played with magnets with positive and negative sides you will find that the positive and negative sides will attract and pull to each other. And if you were to put positive to positive they would resist. 

Why do opposites attract? 
Opposites attract because they are one thing truly in essence. An example of this is hot and cold. Two seemingly opposite things. Yet first we must admit that cold truly isn't a thing at all more so just a concept. Because there is only heat or lack thereof. Lack of heat is what we refer to as cold. But this is nonsensical.  Would you refer to the shadow cast by a tree as the tree itself? No. The tree is the tree and the shadow is the shadow. 

Yet you could not have the cold without the heat. Or the heat without the cold because if you did not have the cold you would not be able to understand heat and you would eventually lose the ability to appreciate heat. Much is the same with this life we call THE Life. We wonder why everything must die. Because if we did not have death we would not have life. We could not understand it. You can not have a background without a figure or a figure without a background. You could not have space without objects to occupy it you could not have objects without them occupying some space. This is the process of the matrix. It is duality and yet at the same time it is unity. This is the idea of the yin and yang. Eastern mysticism is taking our country by storm and now it is time to realize who you are shiva.

religion,What makes people believe in Islam?," I just don't get why so many people are joining Islam. You might convince me to join but I don't think so.

Muslims may claim that up to 80% of quran is scientifically correct, but it quran mentions everything in very twisted words. For example, muslims claim that quran predicted planes, but I'd say the line that supposedly predicts it, doesn't really mean it.

Where I'm going? I think muslims want to believe in what their families believe and they interpret quran in a different way than it's supposed to.

Why do you think Bible is not right then? You might say both books are right but bible says that Jesus is a son of god while quran says that he is just a prophet. Many muslims believe that the bible has been corrupted but there's no word in quran about that.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending christians since I'm non-religious myself but I'm very interested in those topics.

Also there's no logic in believing that heaven and hell exists. When a person dies, he stops breathing, his heart stops how in the hell is it possible for a soul to travel somewhere else?

religion,Why do Christians do this?,"Please forgive me if this isn't the right subreddit to post this. Let me start by saying that I grew up on a extremely religious family in the Bible Belt of the USA. We would go to church every single weekend, pray every night since i was a kid, at around 13-14 I started to question things and now I'm an atheist as of a couple of years ago (I'm in my early 30's). Now I'll respect people's religious views but it just seems rather one sided that Christians are offended if someone isn't a believer but they completely disregard others opinions/beliefs.

I began working as a service agent for a car rental company which for the most part the best place I've worked for in a good while and I had the weekends off and all my colleagues with the exception of one who eventually got terminated for some crazy shit never threw religion around while at work. However, every once in a while, maybe once or twice a week I would have someone who I had to pick up from somewhere or I had to drop off would occasionally bring up religion, which I politely told them I am not religious or that I don't discuss religion while on the job. This gradually went to between 4-5 times a week and as of maybe the past 3-4 months it turned into about 3-4 times a day. It has even gotten to the point where customers throw temper tangents, pray excessively and/or give out sermons while in the vehicle as if I'm possessed by a demon or something. In addition to the customers wanting to discuss Christianity they've even as gone as far as to totally mess up the settings in vehicles where all the preset radio stations are on a Christian channel and you are unable to make any changes to the system.

So that was a the short story and I was wondering why do people try so hard and so much to turn others into Christians?

I've never ever had a problem of an atheist coming to me and saying that i shouldn't believe in god or even had a Muslim, Jew or other religious person, but for some reason Christians make their goal to try and turn others, I don't get it.",1579549639.0

**In surah An-Nisa verse 171-172, It says:** 

  **١٧١**  يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لَا تَغْلُوا فِي دِينِكُمْ وَلَا تَقُولُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْحَقَّ ۚ إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِنْهُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ۖ وَلَا تَقُولُوا ثَلَاثَةٌ ۚ انْتَهُوا خَيْرًا لَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّمَا اللَّهُ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ سُبْحَانَهُ أَنْ يَكُونَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ ۘ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَكِيلًا 

 **171**  O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion, and do not say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Messenger of Allah, and His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and do not say, ""Three."" Refrain—it is better for you. Allah is only one God. Glory be to Him—that He should have a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is a sufficient Protector. 

 **١٧٢**  لَنْ يَسْتَنْكِفَ الْمَسِيحُ أَنْ يَكُونَ عَبْدًا لِلَّهِ وَلَا الْمَلَائِكَةُ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ ۚ وَمَنْ يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيْهِ جَمِيعًا

**In surah Al-Ma'idah verse 17, 72-76, It says:**

 **١٧**  لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ ۚ قُلْ فَمَنْ يَمْلِكُ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئًا إِنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُهْلِكَ الْمَسِيحَ ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَأُمَّهُ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا ۗ وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ۚ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ 

 **17**  They disbelieve those who say, ""Allah is the Christ, the son of Mary."" Say, ""Who can prevent Allah, if He willed, from annihilating the Christ son of Mary, and his mother, and everyone on earth?"" To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. He creates whatever He wills, and Allah has power over everything. 

 **٧٢**  لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ ۖ وَقَالَ الْمَسِيحُ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ رَبِّي وَرَبَّكُمْ ۖ إِنَّهُ مَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ ۖ وَمَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ مِنْ أَنْصَارٍ 

 **72**  They disbelieve those who say, ""Allah is the Messiah the son of Mary."" But the Messiah himself said, ""O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever associates others with Allah, Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. The wrongdoers have no saviors."" 

 **٧٣**  لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةٍ ۘ وَمَا مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ إِلَّا إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۚ وَإِنْ لَمْ يَنْتَهُوا عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ لَيَمَسَّنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ 

 **73**  They disbelieve those who say, ""Allah is the third of three."" But there is no deity except the One God. If they do not refrain from what they say, a painful torment will befall those among them who disbelieve. 

 **٧٤**  أَفَلَا يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ 

 **74**  Will they not repent to Allah and ask His forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. 

 **٧٥**  مَا الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِنْ قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ وَأُمُّهُ صِدِّيقَةٌ ۖ كَانَا يَأْكُلَانِ الطَّعَامَ ۗ انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُبَيِّنُ لَهُمُ الْآيَاتِ ثُمَّ انْظُرْ أَنَّىٰ يُؤْفَكُونَ 

 **75**  The Messiah son of Mary was only a messenger, before whom other Messengers had passed away, and his mother was a woman of truth. They both used to eat food. Note how We make clear the revelations to them; then note how deluded they are. 

 **٧٦**  قُلْ أَتَعْبُدُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَمْلِكُ لَكُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا ۚ وَاللَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ 

 **76**  Say, ""Do you worship, besides Allah, what has no power to harm or benefit you?"" But Allah: He is the Hearer, the Knower. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is other verses pointing that out, but the point is that the people in that time though that Jesus is the son of god or god himself, But he said he is not and that Allah is our lord and only god which his majesty has no need for anything(like a son or whatever it may be). And Allah said Islam is the only religion to be accepted after the prophet Mohammed came, why? because some Christians people in the past changed the truth and some verses in the Bible so that they can convince themselves that they are right.

In the end, you have your rights to believe in whatever you want and i really respect that, but wanted to give what i think is the truth because of what is said in The Quran and give the choice to think about it, after all Allah is forgiving and merciful and said that anyone who joins Islam, whatever his beliefs were, is forgived for his/her past sins.",1590463136.0

3.) It just lacks legitimate conversations. We used to have them in past. Now it's people mostly forcing their religion down people's throat or if they disagree, they rant.

religion,Shopping for a faith (HELP) (LONG),"Im facing an existential... moment.

I’m a westerner, who was never really exposed to religion by either side of my family. One of my great grandmas who I never met became a Catholic later in life, but that’s it. My mom always kept her crucifix in the house, but we never went to church or anything. I was never baptized.

Christianity is the most familiar to me I guess. But I would not call my self a Christian. Although I like a lot of what Christianity has to say; I also dislike a lot of it.

I want to be a religious person. I want that sense of security that my soul will be ok no matter what happens here on earth. But I can’t just choose any religion can I?

It’s like I’m in front of a roulette table, and I have one chip.

This is my thought process:

In a way, if it’s gods will, wouldn’t all choices be fine so long as they are god minded? Meaning, so long as the faith believes in one supreme entity, wouldn’t my choice be null and void of criticism by god? I mean... my guess is as good as any as to where I should place my chip on the proverbial roulette table right? Why would god subject me to such an unknowable thing as how to gain his acceptance?

What about the isolated tribes of history who christians never got to, to spread the word? Were their souls ok

Will my soul be ok if I never choose a religion? Is that my fault that I’m so unsure?

Can I be a man of god, and follow my own tenets of what I believe god wants for me and for the world? The only problem I see with that is, would MY IDEA of god be an idol? It seems like I have to pick one scripture, adhere to that one scripture, and hope I’m right. But then how can I ever truly commit if I’m constantly hoping I didn’t chose the wrong faith? I feel I would always carry that shred of doubt no matter what. And that would sully everything. A wasted endeavour?

One time I saw a video where Pope Francis was somewhere in the Middle East; at a holy site. A certain wall if I remember correctly. He was accompanied by a rabbi and an imam, both from his native country of Argentina. They hugged, and that made me feel a little better. They all believe in the same god in the end.

I know there are religions besides the Abrahamic ones. Ones with multiple deities, some that aren’t so clear on what god is. I could never reasonably research them all, nor would I ever be certain as to which one was right, which one was wrong.

To make matters even more complicated, once chosen a religion, which sect or denomination do I choose?

Surely god knew I would face this dilemma. I believe in god, I believe in a higher entity. 

I usually just look up into the night sky and pray in a Christian sort of way and talk to the universe. Most of the time I’ll do the sign of the cross (I guess because of movies, and my familiarity to Christianity). I ask it (the universe) for good things, I thank it for all the good in my life. And I like to think: so long as I keep doing good things that I’ll be ok in the end. But then there’s a part of me that wonders... is that enough?

Am I just doomed? I guess you would call me a hopeless-agnostic. And sometimes I feel like that’s all I’ll ever be.

I’ve asked the universe to show me signs. To point me in the right direction. But I’m sure a lot of people have, and they’ve felt guided into all sorts of faiths. And they’re all so certain. I wish I could feel that certainty.

I need real guidance. And I was hoping maybe this sub was a good start.

I’m also part Native American, and my grandmother introduced me to some of that spirituality when I was younger. I hold a lot of those ideas dear to me: the eagle, the creator, etc. But there is no scripture to it, just takes passed down by word of mouth. Maybe that’s how it aught to be anyways. Idk.

religion,"An answer to the “if god is real, why is there suffering?” Question","The point i see more and more is “if god is real, why does he allow so much evil and suffering in the world?” 

The answer is actually painfully simple but a lot of anti religious sentiment seems to prevent people from actually processing the information.

Free will, this is something people have that in most religions cannot be interfered with by god, it’s a kind of quality assurance feature built right into the universe that stops god from direct action that may effect or conflict with free will or people.
This doesn’t mean god is not able to intervene in the world but it means that god is powerless to save us from ourselves and the suffering we administer to one another.

If we as a being decided to do something evil out of choice then god can not prevent the action, so the argument that god cannot exist or that god is evil for allowing the suffering is invalid, we are the cause of the suffering so it is not the place of anyone but us to prevent it.

This isn’t a Christian preaching either, I’m not a part of any religions I just study different cultures and beliefs so I can make my own mind up with all the information or rather more of the information.

religion,Mod update: A new rule and introducing RRModPostBot,"After lots of user feedback and a discussion among the mods, we have decided to introduce a new rule to the sub:

* No ""What's my religion?"" posts outside of designated threads created by the mods. That is, asking what religion suits your beliefs, what religion matches certain qualities that you're interested in joining, etc. will no longer be allowed in user-created posts.

***

To facilitate this new rule, we have created a new bot that we'll be launching today: /u/RRModPostBot. RRModPostBot will create automated mod posts on /r/religion. Specifically, at this time it will create a weekly post for the ""What's my religion?"" discussion. This will be a new thread started every Monday where users can pose their question in a top-level comment, and others can answer them in the replies.

If you have feedback on RRModPostBot, let us know in the comments, or you can send us a mod message or reach out to us on the official Discord.",1601321382.0
religion,Ten Incredible Reasons Why Hinduism is an Amazing Religion,"1. It is the most ancient living religion.
          - Hinduism is a very ancient tradition. Some of its beliefs and practices date backs to prehistoric times. Probably, the present day Hinduism contains some elements and aspects of the religious beliefs and practices of the Indus civilization. Hinduism is the only continuing tradition in the world with such diversity, complexity and wide following. The Vedic civilization is believed to be at least 4000 years old. While we do not know when the first Rigvedic hymns were composed, historians believe that some of the hymns may be as old as the Indus civilization, or even older. Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and many folk traditions, ascetic traditions and schools of philosophy that are today part of Hinduism may also be older than the Vedic religion.

2. You have the freedom to choose your path and methods of worship.
          - In Hinduism you are free to choose your beliefs and your path. You are not under any obligation to choose your methods of worship or forms of God. You have complete freedom to worship God according to your nature and disposition. You may choose the formless, highest God, or God with forms and aspects. You may worship your own Self as your personal deity. You may also worship numerous gods and goddesses, and make offerings to them through rituals and sacrificial ceremonies. You can pick any deity in the pantheon, and make him or her the highest, Supreme Self. You are also free to choose your methods of worship, whether you choose right hand methods or left hand methods, and whether you prefer physical worship, mental worship, or spiritual worship. In formal ritual worship you have to follow strictly the procedure suggested in the scriptures and may need the help of trained priests, but in informal, domestic worship you can choose your own prayers and methods of worship.
 
3. It is an earthly, humanistic tradition.
          - Hinduism has its roots in both heaven and the earth. It has many scriptures whose source is God. However, much of its knowledge, philosophy and practice are also derived from numerous teacher traditions, seers, saints, spiritual masters, ascetic movements, scholars, philosophers, and even ordinary housewives. Historically, it has been shaped by the exploration of enlightened masters into the secrets of the mind, body, and spirit. It has features that appeal to the most intelligent and highly educated as well as to the common masses who are not well versed in scriptural or intellectual knowledge. It is also an earthly tradition, which envisages divinity and the play of God in every aspect of the earthly life and does not discount the importance of mortal life and the material world in God's creation.

4. It is essentially an intellectual and spiritual religion.
          - In Hinduism knowledge of Self alone is considered true knowledge (vidya) and the rest ignorance. While rituals are important in worldly life, the true purpose of human life is to achieve liberation for which you have to purify your mind and body, sharpen your intellect and withdraw your mind into the contemplation of God or Self. The scriptures suggest that by performing dutiful actions without desires (karma sanyasa yoga) one becomes an adept in the yoga of knowledge. From the yoga of knowledge results the stability of the mind (buddhi yoga) and its absorption in the Self (atma samyama yoga). From that arises discernment and freedom from delusion and ignorance. Hinduism encourages search for truth with the help of reason as well as spiritual means. It encourages you to validate the truths of existence through direct knowledge (pratyaksha). Its scriptures and philosophical teachings are deeply shrouded in symbolism. To understand them you require spiritual purity, sharp intellect, knowledge and wisdom.

5. It is not a proselytizing religion.
          - According to our beliefs you will not be born as a Hindu or come to it unless you deserve it or qualify for it. No one would force you or tempt you to become a Hindu. You must earn the merit through your study, effort, and past karma to become a Hindu. The Bhagavadgita clearly affirms that your dharma, however inferior it may be, is better than the dharma of another person, even if it is superior. The reason is that your religion or dharma is an extension of your essential nature. It is what dharma means, your natural state or disposition. Hence, Hinduism is not proselytizing religion, and does not encourage active or aggressive conversion of people. Each individual, embodied soul (jiva) is in a certain state of spiritual transformation, which must be allowed to proceed without outside interference. One may teach spiritual knowledge or spread the wisdom of scriptures, but only as a service to God or to others who may need it, but not as a missionary activity.

6. It recognizes female goddesses and gender equality.
          - In Hinduism, there is no difference in the spirituality of men and women. Souls have no gender, and they may change their gender from birth to birth according to their desires and karma. There is a clear discrimination in Hinduism against women in religious duties and householder responsibilities, but no such discrimination exist in spiritual matters. Women are free to pursue religious or spiritual knowledge and seek their liberation. Further, in no other tradition the Supreme Being is perceived as a goddess, or creation and existence are viewed as the combination of male and female principles. The Indus people worshipped the Mother Goddess. Vedic people worshipped numerous goddesses, and the tradition continues. Every god in Hindu pantheon has one or more associated goddesses. The Supreme Self is described in the scriptures as passive witness consciousness, will and pure intelligence, while the Goddess as the active, transformative, energy principle. They are also known as Purusha and Prakriti. Purusha is the enjoyer, the owner of the field (kshetrajna) and Prakriti is the enjoyed, the field (kshetra). Their union results in the diversity of the worlds and beings.

7. You are free from institutional control.
          - In Hinduism you are not oppressed by dogma, or any institutional authority that upholds it. There is no moral police breathing down on your necks and telling you what you should or should not do, how you should dress, or which methods of worship you should follow. You may face criticism from the public or social disapproval from some if you deliberately hurt the religious sentiments of people or insult their faith. However, there is no formal authority to judge you or impose any penalties upon you.

8. You are not viewed as a sinner, but as God or an aspect of God.
          - In Hinduism you are not treated like a sinner, but as an aspect of God, and as an eternal, pure, and sacred being. There is no need for you to confess your sins to any outsider. Since you are your own witness, you need to be honest with yourself and show genuine remorse for any sinful actions you may have done. You earn the grace of God by manifesting his will through your actions as a mark of true surrender. As the eternal Self, you are the lord of your life and body. The world is an impure place, ruled by the all devouring lord of Death, but you are a sacred being drawn into it by the forces of Nature. You are deluded by circumstances and the play of Prakriti, but you are God in human form, and represent him here in every facet of life.

9. You are responsible for your life and liberation.
          - In Hinduism, you do not have to be afraid of God's wrath or punishment. God is a loving being who is not vengeful. He may help you if you pray to him, but does not punish you simply because you do not pray to him. You are judged by your own thoughts, desires, and actions, and you are squarely responsible for your life, actions, and inaction. You cannot transfer the blame to others. There is no devil as such, but the world is not free from evil. It may try to pierce your mind and senses and pollute your desires and intentions, but you can prevent it from happening by seeking the protection of God and the deities, and by working for your liberation through spiritual practice.

10. You have the opportunity to lead a holistic life and enjoy it.
          - Hinduism encourages you to be like God and live like God upon earth and enjoy your life pursuing the four chief aims, namely virtuous duty (dharma), wealth (artha), sexual pleasure (kama) and liberation (moksha). The four aims ensure that you lead a holistic life and satisfy your carnal, material and spiritual needs without having to abandon any of them. Your life is divided into four phases based upon your duties that are specific to each age. They ensure that you age gracefully and dutifully, and in the process fulfill your obligation towards yourself, others, and God. Whether you choose to be a householder, a renunciant, or a spiritual recluse, your purpose here is to overcome the suffering and the limitations of human life and experience the blissful existence of the Supreme Self in the human body.",1606281135.0

Or is it sometimes a matter of one part making sense and the rest doesn't, but you submit for the part that does?

religion,The difference between religion and spirituality," The difference between religion and spirituality is religion teaches us to believe in God and follow scriptures, but spirituality takes us beyond that. Religion is just a kindergarten, it teaches us the ABC about God. But spirituality is a university. It makes us realize God. It makes us realize the Truth that we are not this body that we seem to be, we are the Divine Spirit, a manifestation of God. Therefore we must start with religion. All religions are good, we don't need to change our religion but we must move to spirituality, which is not a religion - it is beyond religion. And there is no best way; ‘my way’, ‘your way’, is not the best way. The only way that is the best way is the way of the Truth. And there are no two ways to the Truth. There is only one Truth - we have to realize that Truth.",1606280592.0

religion,I’m 22(m) and I don’t know what to believe anymore,"I’ve grown up in a religious household always being taught that there is a creator and we must believe and have a relationship with God. I never really started to question it until I got into high school but even then I kept on going through the motions of being a Christian. I feel like since then I’ve gone back and forth from totally believing to having strong doubts. And each time it’s stronger on both sides. I feel like it was always something I could turn to when I get hurt or feel lost. But after I went to college I learned this was a pretty unhealthy way for me to cope with actual problems I was having. I learned that those things that hurt me or those moments where I could feel lost could be fixed through things I decided to do to fix them. Real actions that helped me grow into a healthier person. Anyway, now I’m surrounded by my family and a few close friends that whole heartedly believe that Christianity is the answer to life. They are amazing and wonderful people but are consistently attempting to make me just like them. Or better to say “To grow with them.” I’ve researched so many religions to try to gain a better understanding of what could be true. I came to the conclusion that there are so many different people and cultures that have made so many different ideas about what they believe to be true. 

When I decided to actually put everything I had into being a Christian I felt a sense of peace about where my life was headed because I didn’t know where it was headed. Because I trusted God to guide me. So I had no sense of direction. All of my family has said God speaks to them when they pray. So I tried for months praying asking God to give me a better sense of direction and where he wants me. Silence. I always came back to the things that brought me joy and working on my dream but I felt like I couldn’t enjoy it anymore because my dream doesn’t glorify God. Is it wrong to believe in my dream other than God? Can I still believe in God and work on my dream? 

I feel like where I am at now is at a terrible breaking point of what I need to decide. I’ve never posted anything anywhere before but it seemed like people could be honest on here. I feel like I’m only holding on to Christianity because of the fear of going to Hell. Can I accept God in my heart and not have to go to church every Sunday? In the past few months I’ve worked towards my goals for this world more than I ever have in my life and it excites me. Then my family says that everything in the world is all a waste of time because it will mean nothing in eternity. So I’m starting to lose motivation to work towards something that makes me happy because it wouldn’t matter. Even if it reaches a lot of people and relates to a lot of other people it would be pointless because the world is going to end one day. From reading this you might be able to tell I’m very confused and very unsure of what to believe in. I’m literally at the point where I feel like I need to decide whether or not I believe.",1604343216.0

I believe (and I am fairly new to Christianity), that god tasked Lucifer to be the bad guy. It is kind of like the Wonka and Slugworth type situation, where Slugworth is the devil, while Wonka is god. I think the devil will tempt you into doing bad things, but if you fall for it, you end up failing the morality test. This is just an interesting theory that I have in mind. To me, I believe god wants to truly test his subjects, and I feel like this way seems more reasonable, and it does not paint anyone in a bad light, and makes god look very smart. Do you guys agree?

religion,"Religion in Film: ""Contact"" and Rejected Prophets.","\~\~Not sure if this the correct subreddit. I cannot find any Religion in Film sort of subreddits\~\~

&amp;#x200B;

Recently on a post about Biblically accurate angels (In this case the wheel-with-in-a-wheel-all-covered-in-eyes type angel), there was an observation connecting this to the movie *Contact* (1997 Starring Jodie Foster).

[https://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/jl5sec/this\_is\_a\_biblically\_accurate\_angel\_yes\_i\_am\_not/ganhh29?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/jl5sec/this_is_a_biblically_accurate_angel_yes_i_am_not/ganhh29?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

In Contact there is a portal, a machine thought to lead to a higher truth that looks like the Ezekiel angel.

&amp;#x200B;

This lead me further down a line of thought in considering Jodie Foster's character, the protagonist ""Dr. Eleanor Arroway"", as a prophet of sorts.

Hear me out.

So, Dr. Arroway, via a portal of sorts produced in the center of the Ezekiel-angel-esque machine, discovers hidden truths about the nature of the universe. When Dr. Arroway comes back she is *rejected*. Despite having been chosen as a somewhat objective scientist for the role of the machine test subject (after the previous one, a Christian, is killed by a religious dissenter of the project). She comes into contact (roll credits) with an important truth. Thus, one could see a connection to a sort of prophet role. As a prophetess she is rejected. Earlier in the film Dr. Arroway is derogatorily referred to as ""high priestess of the desert"". It's not a big step to go from a priestess to a prophetess, at least not in a general sense.

Thus the main character of Contact becomes a Rejected Prophet via contact with a greater truth via an Ezekiel-angel-esque machine.

&amp;#x200B;

Food for thought.

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. Are there Religion and Film subreddits?

Edit: Does Dr. Arroway's experience count as a heirophany, a manifestation of the sacred? (A somewhat unconnected further thought)",1604123573.0

religion,Blending of Islam and Christianity?,"This is probably the dumbest question I've ever come up with, but I'm feeling crazy tonight, so why not?! 

I was raised in a traditional Christian household, and still hold many of the fundamental tenet to be true. I walked away when I got old enough to recognize the disgusting amount of internal politics in denominational organizations, and the slow and steady weakening of the strength of their support for those fundamental tenets. I was further discouraged at how all of the non-denominational churches were so willing to throw all principle out the window in order to just sing praise songs to each other all day so they didn't have to tell their followers ""no"" on anything.

I've recognized some of those Christian tenets I still support in traditional Islam, and it appears, from my position looking from a distance, that Islam has somewhat managed to avoid losing their resolve at supporting many of their own traditional beliefs. 

Fundamentally, I believe that 3 of the major religions on Earth (Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) all worship the same God. Each religion see's God a little differently, but there appear to be more general commonalities than not. I am open to being completely wrong about this. My stance is that God's plan is revealed to humanity in a way that is not an accident, and that many of the world religions have a piece of Truth. Maybe some more than others, but I want to believe that there is a life after death, and that people from many different walks of life will be there. 

So, intro to the question done, the question is if it is possible to be a Christian who blends in some of the teachings, doctrine, and  ritual/customs of Islam? Or is it possible to follow Islam while adopting some of the teachings, doctrine, and  ritual/customs of Christianity?",1604039975.0

religion,Why did God create us in the first place?,"This question is mainly for Abrahamic religions. 

One issue that keeps bothering me when it comes to the way religion presents our beginnings and why we are here is that it doesn't make sense, and at times makes God look like a sadistic game player.

The story goes something like this;

God was somewhere on his own, and out of the blue decided to create the earth and humans. Then, someone who is not supposed to be there somehow managed to get in and convince whoever the first humans were to eat from a tree, and from there, things went south. Fast forward to today, billions of people have suffered. Most humans so far lived a life of misery, fighting to survive. Millions killed millions. Animals suffered at the hands of mankind and others in the animal kingdom. Earthquakes, pandemics, tsunamis all had their fair share of ending the lives of many. And the suffering doesn't end here, because for two religions, Christianity and Islam, the suffering continues even after death where those who don't fit the box, are sent to everlasting hell or a place of pain. So just when you think death at least will bring an end to the suffering, you're presented with a God who is going to see at least half of the humans HE CREATED burn forever and ever.

What is the point then? Why would God, if he knows everything there is to know, decided to keep going with a plan he knew very well would result in the suffering and death of billions? What is the point of us being here? Did he really have to create us knowing what was going to happen? Are we like an entertaining reality show for him to watch and see who survives in the end? If I was a loving and merciful God and saw that if I create some creatures who will end up disobeying me and then on top of that suffer unimaginable pain so in the end many of them will end up in a place called Hell, I would cancel the whole thing. However, God according to most Abrahamic religions didn't cancel the plan but continued with it anyway, knowing very well what we know today. 

Why? People ask atheists why there is something rather than nothing, and I would also ask theists why is there something rather than nothing when this something is so twisted, full of pain and misery, and on top of that it was all made possible by a God who decided for some reason that he would like to bring all this to the universe? 

Some people might say that God made a way for our salvation, but that doesn't answer the problem. The reason we need salvation to begin with is that this same God is the one who created the whole thing. God started the game and somehow he is the one offering us the cure.",1603916222.0

religion,I don’t really know what my personal belief system is called....,"Hi all. just a side note... I was born and raised Catholic but have since opened my mind up a little to believe that NO religion is 100% correct, yet every religion has some truth to them, and if you were to (somehow) learn and connect those truths, you’d find the *actual* truth of the universe. I’m also a Freemason. Ok, now I’ll just get right to the point. I believe in a God, or better yet, I believe in an all powerful being. However I don’t believe most religion’s idea of a God that is “all good” or “all caring”. I don’t believe that a God can be “all powerful” and “all good” simultaneously. In fact I think that the two things contradict. An “all powerful” God would inevitably have to comit some act that isn’t good. In fact, I think “good” and evil” is a human construct. Something evil to us may be considered good or necessary to an all powerful being. Anyway, I also don’t believe that this “all powerful” being gives a shit about us. Similar to how we use a magnifying glass to burn ants when we’re kids, we just don’t give a shit about the ants.

I’m also not totally disbelieving of the possibility of there being both an “all powerful” being AND an “all good” being that follows the dogma of many religions, with there essentially being a pyramid of power with humans somewhere near the bottom. I suppose that would be some form of polytheism, but I don’t really have a specific name for my beliefs.

""Winter always turns to spring"" (Japanese: 冬は必ず春となる）: You can overcome even the worst situation that you find yourself in and every obstacle, through employing the strategy of the Lotus Sutra.

”Cherry, plum, peach and damson"" (Japanese: 桜梅桃李）: Just as flowers come in various varieties, so do human beings, each different and unique in their own way, and capable of manifesting their inner Buddha nature in this lifetime.

""Turning poison into medicine"" (Japanese: 変毒為薬）: A cause of suffering can be transformed, through your own effort, and become a cause of happiness or joy in this lifetime and beyond.

One argument that comes up a lot is the universe needs a god to exist. The ""first cause"" argument.

While I can understand this argument from a deistic perspective, where there is some entity that is so powerful it created the universe we exist it.  This is certainly possible but beyond any understanding right now.

Where I get lost is how you can then jump to ""and it is the god I believe in"" with no further conjecture.  

To me, there is a huge gap between an ""all powerful entity"" and ""my particular god"" especially when that god has nothing more than ancients texts written by anonymous authors and lots and lots of other problems.

Let's take christian apologists who use this argument. Are they using this argument in a theistic or deistic manner?

I know it is probably theistic and that blows my mind how they can make such huge leaps and consider it evidence.

But at the same time, I strongly believe that life is far too complex to have occurred just by the course of science. I’m not doubting science — I believe in evolution and all that. But it seems to me like there’s something missing. Has existence been here always? Why is it that out of 8 million+ species on Earth, only humans are the most intelligent ones? Why have we not found extraterrestrial life? What is the meaning of life?

There are some questions in science that remain unanswered. However, one thing I acknowledge is that it takes time to discover things. For example, early humans might have thought that natural disasters, such as earthquakes, were punishment from God. But now we know that there’s a logical scientific explanation for them. So for questions that remain unanswered, I don’t necessarily want to assume that God is the reason behind them, when it could be that we just haven’t discovered it.

One theory I’ve heard of is that God created the universe, and then left. While I could see this explaining the complexities of life, why would he do that? If you’re the creator of literally everything, why would you just disappear?

I don’t know. There’s atheism. There’s religion. Then there’s me, stuck in the middle and unable to find a place where I feel I belong. I’ve tried practicing various religions and they just feel wrong. But being atheist doesn’t seem to be where I’m at either.",1603581323.0

I am a baptist and he is a Mormon. He has not been following the mormon faith since I met him, he drinks, smokes, and has premarital sex which made me think it was not going to be a big problem to work out. He went on a mission trip with the church a while back and is very passionate about his experiences there. He has been practicing since he was young very strictly until the past 2 years hit. He had never drank alcohol or had sex until marriage (he was previously married to a mormon girl). 

&amp;#x200B;

There has been a lot of rising tension in our relationship because mormons believe that to marry and be together for eternity, that couples must get married in the Temple. To even step inside, you have to be an orthodox Mormon. I have been raised as a baptist since I was a baby, though I did not go on a long mission trip, I have always been actively involved and passionate about my beliefs. I decided to break it off with him a few weeks ago because I told him that I would never convert, so technically we could never marry. It is a big deal for him to marry in the temple. After a few days of not talking I missed him so much that I told him I thought we should stay together.

religion,Symbolism of Bulls,"Images of bulls were found in several Indus Valley seals. They suggest that since the earliest times bulls had a socio-religious significance in ancient India. In the Vedic world, the bull represented masculinity, virility, strength, aggression, and fighting power. The Sanskrit word vrishan, derived from the root world, vrish, was originally used in the Vedas to denote all males, including men. However, another of its derivatives, Vrishabha was used to denote various types of bulls, including horse bulls and male boar. The Vedas describe Indra as a strong bull of manliness and mighty strength. They also signify the sexual prowess of the bulls by stating that Agni or Indra descend from the heaven to the earth roaring like a husband to his wives. The bull has a special significance in Shaivism and Hindu Tantra. Lord Shiva is known as Vrishabhanath, lord of the bulls. His vehicle is Nandi, the divine bull, also known as Basava, who is worshipped by devotees individually as a personal god and in association with Shiva as his vehicle. 

According to some, Nandi is not a bull in the ordinary sense, but a divine being, and a close confidant of Lord Shiva, whose anthropomorphic form is represented by a half human and half bull body. He is known for his knowledge, devotion, obedience, surrender, virtue, and dedication to Shiva and his devotees of Shiva, and fought many battles to protect the gods, slay the demons and uphold dharma. The images of Nandi are invariably found in every Shiva temple. There are also some famous temples in India which are exclusively dedicated to Nandi. As the vehicle of Shiva, Nandi represents knowledge, scholarship, devotion, surrender, renunciation, obedience, strength and virility. However, in Hinduism bulls symbolically represent both positive and negative qualities. On the positive side they represent manliness, virility, manly strength, sexual prowess, and fighting spirit. 

On the negative side, they symbolize darkness, brute power, excessive sexuality, lust, anger, aggression, promiscuity, waywardness, ignorance, and delusion. On specific occasions, Hindus worship bulls and make them offerings of food. Since they are considered sacred, as in case of cows, hurting or harming them is strictly prohibited in Hinduism.",1603433934.0

religion,"The physics of the human body; ties underlying knowledge of Christianity, Hinduism, and Native folklore with metaphysical understanding of Tesla.","The human body is a bioelectric engine absorbing and creating energy as it passes through the filter of our being, with the brain acting as an antennae that shoots energy out into the world. Every piece of matter is energy condensed into specific vibration patterns, and when chemical bonds break the matter is released back into an energetic state; this cyclical transfer of energy is the dynamic of spirit.

Energy moves through frequencies unique to their respective resonance; as energy moves through space, it aligns and amplifies with other energies of similar frequency. This principle is the Law of Attraction where like attracts like, and it works on every level of reality.

There are four bodies in a human; physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. When we are not true to our authentic soul, the interactions between these bodies become discordant. This can cause energy flow throughout the physical body to become misaligned or stagnate completely. As energy is never created or destroyed but only transformed, allowing energy to discharge and flow naturally will prevent recurring cycles or blockages. If left unchecked, these obstructions often express themselves various physical ailments such as nerve pain or emotional discomfort.

When the physical body dies it is separated from the ethereal bodies, which also follow the Law of Attraction, guiding these energies to the frequencies they inhabited in their conscious life. In most cases this ethereal energy recycled through reincarnation by grey karma. When your bodies in alignment and truly connected to Love-consciousness, you attain Nirvana &amp; open the doorway to Heaven.

Part of these lower energy blockages is lower vibrational patterns, which manifest themselves as demons. These demons are not meant to be feared, but ignoring their presence can destroy you. Turning a blind eye to these inner workings will allow them to play on your subconscious instead of being recognized through conscious intent. Imagine the human system is a glass of water and inner demons are dirt particles polluting the water; when we are out of alignment the water is cloudy with dirt spreading throughout. Through conscious effort we seek inner peace and allow stillness to realign our bodies so the dirt can settle, giving us ground to plant our feet firmly.

This grounding largely relies on respecting the nature of duality. Lucifer and Satan are the same being in aspects of light and shadow; Lucifer literally translates as ""Light-Bringer"". Shunning and dismissing the ""negative"" aspects of the human experience prevents the healing process from beginning. Acknowledging our demons and treating them with love and acceptance is an important part of our journey which allows us to recognize our shortcomings as lessons to be learned; this leads to more transmutation of our inner being into Light.

The most primary example of this misunderstanding is within our sexuality, the creative force of universe. People get caught up in spending this energy on fleeting pleasure as shots of lustful dopamine, when we can instead harness this carnal function and lift the power of creation up the ladder of the spine until it reaches our Crown. From here it can repair the golden light of Halo as the Serpent of Kundalini energy climbs our chakra system to form the Ouroboros within aura.

The true dichotomy of mankind is learning how our dynamic energy-engine of Heart can function either out of Fear or out of Love; every other emotion can be derived from that spectrum. By transforming our consciousness into a loving state, we begin accessing 5th dimensional consciousness as we realign ourselves with the Astral realms through the connection to the spiritual self fueled by the other bodies. Only when we can pass through the Dark Night of the Soul, which holds our ego in states of desire and craving, can we operate out of a state of Loving connection to this moment without attachment to external desire. Through this process we begin to see in absolute clarity as we understand which direction our Heart is pulling us towards.

We are currently faced with a huge disconnection between our heart and spirit. The past failures of religious dogma stole the symbology of the serpent and demonized it to keep our spiritual power hidden, using literacy as a weapon to persecute, suppress, and destroy ancient wisdoms that came from outside the church, sending us into the Dark Ages warring over belief systems. Healing from these past atrocities requires recognition of the trauma and sin that have been deeply rooted into our flesh through the generational karma of this misconduct. This blasphemous misuse of spiritual guidance led to the suppression of healing magic from nature, preventing true acknowledgment from threatening the old power structures of priests and bishops ruling over the working class. Inevitably, the innate truths stemming from natural wisdom have gradually lifted the veil.

As more and more people wake up and recognize humanity's past wrongdoings, we are stepping into the ascension of mankind as the age of misinformation comes to an end. The Rainbow Warrior Tribe, those destined to unite all colours of skin under the Sun, are faced with overcoming the stranglehold of land, sea, sky, and heart; the Black Death. As humanity sheds its old ways of thinking we move through the Kali Yuga, an age of death and rebirth; The Apocalypse of Fire.

religion,Finding Perfect Peace,"*""Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth thee.""* **Isaiah 26:3**

Though we rarely discuss it, I believe that virtually everyone in the world wrestles with the question of our own sanity at times, as we struggle to find the right balance between such things as recklessness and paranoia, and shyness and egomania. Virtually everyone has little obsessions (locking doors, germs on door handles, or, in my case, using up leftovers, etc.) as well. Yet the verse above suggests that the way to maintain perfect peace in the midst of all these distracting extremes is just to [keep our mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbOY_WQNZ-4) stayed on God.

I am not talking about religion, which, in itself, is often a fertile breeding ground for mental illness. Religious obsessions hardly represent ""perfect peace""; but a humble openness to correction from God is quite different from that.

This word ""perfect"" is interesting in its etymology. Apparently in the days of King James, it did not carry the same mathematical precision that we so often attribute to it today. Instead, it meant something more like a ""deep"" peace, or a ""genuine"" peace, or, more often, a ""mature"" peace. I think of this in contrast to another verse in the Bible that talks about people saying, ""Peace! Peace!"" when there is no peace.

We need to remind ourselves about the need to keep our minds fixed on God, as we lie spiritually prostrate before him, and ever open to his guidance and correction. Out of that relationship arises a peace which will grow and grow (like the kingdom described by the Prince of Peace) until it fills the whole earth. This mature peace is not a placid escape from the noise and demands of the world, but rather a focus that sees through and beyond to another world that is yet to come, and another Ruler for whose kingdom we pray daily.

Outside of this kingdom of peace, life is little more than varying shades of insanity, as people struggle to hold it together without God's help. Most are able to stay out of institutions and even to stay off medications; but inwardly, I think, as I said at the start of this post, they/we are all struggling. Most struggle to achieve some measure of ""respectability"", by which society will declare them sane; but others of us have chosen to put our effort into keeping our minds fixed on God. And when we do, we find a ""perfect"" peace that passes all understanding.

religion,When theists say “God is uncaused” is it special pleading?,"Special pleading (or claiming that something is an overwhelming exception) is a logical fallacy asking for an exception to a rule to be applied to a specific case, without proper justification of why that case deserves an exemption.

In the Thomistic cosmological argument for the existence of God, everything requires a cause. However, proponents of the argument then create a special case where God doesn't need a cause, but they can't say why in any particularly rigorous fashion. 

One response to this argument, beyond pointing out the fallacy, would be to point out that nature itself could have existed eternally in some form just as they say God had existed eternally before creating nature. One who has applied this argument is Carl Sagan, though he wasn't the first to do so.


That being said, such a special pleading when discussing a ""First Cause"" may have some degree of merit; as any computer scientist will tell you, the root of a nested hierarchy may need to be handled as a special case anyway, although said computer scientist can probably also add that there are plenty of directed acyclic graphs that have multiple roots.

My view is that, strictly speaking, it would be special pleading if an exception is only claimed possible for God, but not when one can also imagine a case for something else as equally much a of 'brute fact' of reality i.e. something permanent in nature; the principal base difference between the two claims being that we know that nature exists through first hand observation or empirical means and, to science anyway, everything so far known looks wholly the result of natural processes.

religion,Symbolism of Cow,"The cow symbolizes wealth, compassion, motherliness, righteousness (dharma), motherhood, divinity, sattvic nature, sacrifice, service, purity, and auspiciousness. In ancient India, a person’s social and economic status depended upon the number of cattle he possessed. One of the prime duties of the students in ancient India who studied the Vedas in the gurukulas was to help their teachers by looking after their cows. From the Upanishads we know that served their teachers by taking their cows into the forest for grazing and returned in the evening. Lord Krishna grew up in a family of cowherds and personally tended the cows and other domestic animals in his childhood. The Puranas suggest that the animals and friends around him were mesmerized by the melody of his flute and stayed calm. Shiva is known as Gorakhnath, means the lord of the cows. He is also known as, Pasupathinath, the lord of all animals. According to some scholars, Shiva’s association with cows and bulls might date back to the Indus Valley period. Cows have a special significance in Hinduism, as aspects of Mother Goddess and as symbols of selfless service. Mahatma Gandhi declared the protection of cows a central feature of Hinduism. Hindus worship cows as the Mother Goddess and symbol of motherhood, kindness and forbearance. Kamadhenu, the heavenly cow, is considered the mother of all cows and several gods. She is also considered the source of all abundance with the power to grant the wishes of her devotees. The killing of cows and eating cow meat are strictly prohibited in Hinduism and considered mortal sins with severe karmic consequences. The cows are mentioned in many Vedic rituals such as ashtaka, sulagava, vajapeya, arghya, etc. Cow milk is used in Hinduism in ritual worship as an offering, and for cleansing the ritual objects, and bathing the deities, besides in the preparation of sacrificial food, such as panchamritam, curd, paramannam, etc. Cow urine and cow dung are used in some Vedic rituals in expiation ceremonies to cleanse past sins and in Ayurveda to prepare traditional medicines. Because it is a sacred animal, gods do not use it as a vehicle, but only as the source of auspiciousness, peace, and prosperity. Kamadhenu is a celestial cow, which represents abundance and sacrifice.",1603347441.0

This is the first time I've actually posted on Reddit, I've only been on here for a couple of months now. So if I'm missing a rule or anything, please let me know and I'll happily make adjustments etc. as required!


So I recently read a Christian statement along the lines of: your destiny is dictated by which you follow, God, or the Devil. I can't remember where it was, so not sure of the specific wording - sorry.
That statement struck me as being very polarising.

I describe myself as being either agnostic or atheist.
I agree with agnosticism but still find myself leaning towards atheism.
So according to the aforementioned statement, if I don't explicitly follow God, in a Christian's eyes, does this effectively mean I follow Satan?
I would be inclined to think that it would be more of a scale, and as a product of being a law-abiding, moral person, I would be somewhere on the godly side of midway.

This being said, how is atheism seen by other religions? Are there any who automatically see non-believers of their religion as the polar opposite of themselves?

I hope this makes sense and I haven't 'put my foot in it' - as it were. If there's anything that would be seen as offensive please tell me and I'll delete as appropriate.
I'm not very clued up on religion, to be honest, but this interested me enough to ask.

religion,Why is Televangelism allowed to exist?,"Why do governments/society  tolerate the existence of televangelism?  Most if not\* all televangelists have some ''suspicious'' financial practices - ''A 2003 survey by the [*St. Louis Post-Dispatch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch) indicated that only one out of the 17 televangelists researched were members of the [Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Council_for_Financial_Accountability) '', many televangelists teach the bullshit (B.S.) ''prosperity gospel'',  Some televangelists have significant personal wealth and own large properties, luxury cars, and various transportation vehicles such as private aircraft or ministry aircraft. Not to mention some of them ask for exorbitant amounts of money from their church/mosque/temple followers some of whom actually do pay money for these televangelists to live extremely luxurious lives while some of their members are extremely poor - In 2007, [Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate) [Chuck Grassley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley) opened a probe into the finances of six televangelists who preach a ""[prosperity gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_gospel)"".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televangelism#cite_note-20) The probe investigated reports of lavish lifestyles by televangelists including: fleets of [Rolls Royces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_(car)), palatial mansions, private jets, and other expensive items purportedly paid for by television viewers who donate due to the ministries' encouragement of offerings ,

* Many televangelists (particularly Christian ones) exist outside the structures of Christian denominations, meaning that they are not accountable to anyone, Televangelists claim to be reaching millions of people worldwide with the gospel and producing numerous converts to [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity).

I then studied Christianity and I liked that  unlike in Islam prayer can be done in own language without needing to learn a new complicated one and faith can be practiced more suitable for for everyday living. But I have also found contradictory things. And I've come to the conclusion that the monotheistic religions have good teachings but they also appear to be a tool to control masses and justify atrocities such as slavery, war, child marriage etc.. 
I'm have East African heritage  and I feel that these two religions have also created a lot of havoc in African countries and partially have kept people complacent. 

I researched native religions and felt that I could take something from them as they all have meaningful life teachings and theories of the metaphysical world. 

I have clairvoyant abilities and feel like I can communicate  with the dead. Such abilities are frowned upon in monotheistic religions even though I didn't choose to have these abilities. I have chosen to deepen and strengthen them though which would lead me to witchcraft I guess . But not all witchcraft is bad . Many religious rituals are very magical indeed. 

I feel like I want to incorporate all of these several teachings because I'm not drawn to just one.

religion,New Motherhood and religiousness revivalism,"So, I’m approaching this from anecdotal experience but I’ve found that many women raised in a semi-religious household or area become ultra religious once they have children.


This was true for my mother.  She was raised Methodist but not strongly.  She didn’t attend very often and neither of her parents were strongly religious.

Once she married my father and had me she became strongly religious and raised us in a very very religious (Baptist) household.  


I’ve seen this trend with many friends as well.  Mostly women, raised in religious and conservative towns but not particularly religious households become ultra religious once they become parents.

I graduated in a class of about 120 people and I would say I grew up in one of the more religious households.  I became increasingly less religious post-High School while many of my peers went from not religious (but existing within a particular religion) to ultra religious once they had children.

Is there a reason you may belief women may be prone to becoming more active in their religion once they give birth?


I once asked my mom and her answer was basically, “I couldn’t exist in a world where if something happened to you I could never see you again.  My religion bought me peace.  It assured me that if we were to separate in this world I’d see you again.”

That makes sense to me for sure.  I also see that church may be a sense of community for many young mothers as well.

religion,Symbolism of Elephants,"In the religious traditions of India, elephants symbolize royalty, majesty, strength, divinity, abundance, fertility, intelligence, keenness, destructive power, and grasping power. The souls in elephants are said to be highly evolved and ripe for evolution. The Hindu Puranas suggest that elephants in the past had wings. Elephants appearing in dreams to mothers before the birth of an important person or sage is a common cultural theme of India. An elephant is kingly. Hence, the head of an elephant herd or the royal elephant of a temple goes by the epithet, gajaraj, king of the elephants. Since they represent royalty, power and strength, in the past India had dynasties named after elephants. For example, a dynasty named Gajapathis (lord of the elephants) ruled parts of southern and eastern India. From the writings of Megasthanese, a Greek ambassador in the court of Chandragupta Maurya, we know that kings employed people who excelled in the art of capturing, taming and domesticating wild elephants. Elephant care was an important subject for which there were treatises. The Vedas do not directly refer to the elephants, but we know that elephants were native to India and existed in the subcontinent even before the Vedic civilization. Indra's vehicle is a white, elephant known as Airavath, which according to the Puranas emerged during the churning of the oceans by gods and demons. It was given to Indra as a gift. Ganesha, the lord of the Shiva ganas, has the head of an elephant. His large head symbolizes knowledge, intelligence and thinking power. His trunk represents grasping power, while his large ears denote his attentiveness. In ancient India, elephants played an important role in warfare. Alexander had a great difficulty in fighting with Indian kings as they maintained a large herd of trained elephants that served the same purpose as the tanks in modern warfare. They crushed his army and ended his plans to march farther into the interiors of India. Kings employed elephants not only in warfare but also in construction work and clearing of forests. Until recently, elephants were used in India to lay roads in inaccessible places and haul timber. Even today, many Hindu temples maintain one or more elephants and use them during festivities, and public processions. In a way, it is a sad situation since the elephants remain captive and exposed to the risk of unwanted human attention, negligence, and unintended cruelty.",1603086044.0

religion,The real me. What is it? Is it the part of my mind's that reacts with egotism?,"

I learned that the ego is the result of mixing your Spirit with a human body forcing it to adapt and create an ego persona for this world.
So that means every worldly desires/reactions comes from your ego.

For example Unforgiveness. Whatever someone may have done to you if you don't forgive them than you are using your ego. Forgiveness brings out the real you because it forces you to draw the line between your emotional ego and see the contrast between it and your infinite true self.

Your true self is the you that cares about people in need, the planet, humanism, altruism, sharing, not judging others and many more inspiring things. Draw the line and recognize who you truly are.

Another thing, god openly admits to being a, ""petty God"". When someone's petty its seen as a bad thing, but we praise God nonetheless. Why?

If God can do no wrong and is what we would see as the "" perfect being"" then why does he have these negative traits that can be attached to him? (I:E, Petty and his love being conditional)

religion,AMA - Theistic Satanism,"# **FAQ**

**What is Satanism?**

In short, the honoring of and working with Satan, whether that is an entity, symbol, or part of the Self. Satanism descends from the Stellar Tradition and Left Hand Path, going all the way back to the Pyramid Texts of Egypt, the oldest religious texts.  These paths all share certain common traits – apathy towards cultural norms &amp; values, a high respect for subjective experience, an avoidance of dogma, a focus on the individual Self, a use of Pragmatism, an investment in modern objective knowledge, Skepticism, and Self-deification - whether that means becoming metaphorically Godlike in this life, or literally continuing as a Godlike being after death. The Satanist specifically works within our current cultural paradigm rather than or in tandem with other similar cultural traditions. 

**If Satanists don’t believe in Satan, why call it Satanism?**

Whether a god, angel, title, or force, the Theistic/Esoteric Satanist does in fact believe in Satan. Counter to the accusations this is quite different from the “Devil Worship” of Christianity, which really doesn’t exist in the world. Usually there is little if any need for the Satanist to rely on specifically or solely judeo-christianity for their religion. What are the Christian demons but the gods of old in perverted form? 

**Do you harm animals/children?**

Absolutely not.

**Do you have rules of the earth and sins?**

There is nothing specifically dictating the way theistic Satanism works outside of general LHP characteristics. It is up to the Satanist to find their own values and morality. I personally came up with some “sins” based on my 12+ years in Satanism: hypocrisy, projection, sustained ignorance, martyrdom, guilting, poor aesthetics, materialism/exotericism, lack of doubt, lack of self mockery. 

**What is the deal with magic?**

Magic is basically what allows for free will, possibly thanks to the higher consciousness possessed by human beings (the Black Flame of Satan). Any act of self-directed self-evolution is “black magic”. Magic acts against the mindless, deterministic, material world of the “God of Light” known in our culture as YHWH. It is “my will be done” rather than “thy will be done”. 

**Do you really need all these specific things for ritual?**

You do not even need ritual at all, it is totally up to you, what inspires you, and what you respond to. 

**How do I know if I am a Satanist?**

When you do not have to ask that question even to yourself. Most LHPers are born this way and can see it clearly in themselves when they look back over the years. It is more a matter of realizing and accepting it against cultural bondage. 

**Do I have to join CoS or any organization?**

Definitely not, and in theistic/esoteric Satanism we tend to encourage more individual based practice and study. 

**How do I tell my religious parents I am a Satanist?**

You don’t. 

**How do I sell my soul?**

Join an Abrahamic religion or otherwise RHP tradition, the Prince of Darkness has no interest in your soul other than its independent growth. 

**What do Satanists believe happens when you die?**

Apotheosis, also known as Self-Deification. Becoming ruler of one’s own “Pandemonium”. While this may seem unprecedented in our culture, this was actually the common original belief in human afterlife.

# **""Sins""**

• Hypocrisy: it is up to the LHPer to form their own ethics and values, but those things find their meaning in consistency. It's on you to decide if X is moral or immoral, but if you decide it is immoral you should not do it. Leave it to the RHP to say one thing and do another. 

• Projection: this is basically LaVeyan ""Solipsism"", assuming others think and feel and act as you do. This is not only untrue but undesirable to the LHP, which values uniqueness and individuality. 

• Sustained Ignorance: ignorance is one thing, it's hard to know what things you do not yet know. But when such things are brought to light they should be investigated openly and with childlike enthusiasm. 

• Martyrdom: helping those we love and even strangers can be of benefit within egoism, but doing so at the sacrifice of the Self cannot be. This is not just about self care, but also when you decide to help someone don't complain about it, that was your free choice. 

• Guilting: the reverse of Martyrdom, manipulating someone into doing what you want them to via guilt is morally questionable regarding free will. Not only do they have the choice to not do whatever it is, doing something out of guilt is inferior to doing it out of willingness. However this doesn't relate to debt. If you help someone and they're refusing to help you, feel free to point it out, but also remember their values may not match yours to start (see: projection).

• Poor aesthetics: same as LaVeyan. Have some class, don't be cringy. 

• Materialism &amp; Exotericism: aside from materialism replacing Christianity as the main paradigm, thus making its rejection iconoclastic and heterodox... these things bring death to the concept of free will and self directed self evolution the LHP is founded on. Meat puppets would make poor Satanists. 

• Lack of Doubt: ""Doubt. Doubt thyself. Doubt even if thou doubtest thyself. Doubt all. Doubt even if thou doubtest all. It seems sometimes as if beneath all conscious doubt there lay some deepest certainty. O kill it! Slay the snake!"" - Crowley

• Lack of Self Mockery: if the Satanist rebels against God, and they are first and foremost their own God, they must rebel against the self above all.

religion,I Tried Selling My Soul to the Devil,"I do not identify as religious by any means - in fact I am atheist

I guess I am posting here for others' insight. A few months ago I figured ""why not, sell my soul to Satan for something cool to spice up my life with."" So I said out loud in the middle of the night something along the lines of me offering up my soul for what I could think would be the most fun thing to add in my life - the power of telekinesis. I outlined when I would receive the power, how I could control it, etc. However, nothing has happened. I'm not sure if it is written anywhere what *kinds* of things Satan can give or if my soul just wasn't worth it or something. Anyone have input?",1602985383.0

But I'm a secular Buddhist (which some religious Buddhists aren't a fan of) and there aren't many Buddhists in my area anyway. 

I was just wondering how strongly other people felt about finding a romantic/life partner that holds a belief perspective as similar as them.

religion,Looking for some self-discovery advice,"I am looking for some advice and resources, and I also needed some place to discuss--and perhaps overshare--my current thoughts.

I am in my mid 20s, and have for most of my adolescence believed myself to be atheist or agnostic, but I grew up in an Episcopal family. As I have grown up, I am becoming more and more conflicted with my spiritual beliefs, and I am looking for some nondenominational sources to help me learn about different faiths and also help me discover myself.

I am also concerned that I am allowing my spiritual beliefs to be influenced by my (relatively new) romantic partner, who is Catholic. I really resonate with things they tell me sometimes (only when I ask--they are very good about not pushing me or forcing me to share their beliefs), but I want to make sure any path I begin towards a religion or religious beliefs is completely independent of my partner--I need to make sure that this is an internal process and does reflect truly on how I see the world.

My last personal note, mostly because I need to put it out there, and I don't know where else to do so, is that I am a little embarrassed because of how forcefully I have pushed the notion of religion away in the past. And I don't know how to tell my support system--friends, family, partner, therapist--that I am now unsure and I am trying to discover myself.

Through this post, I don't want anybody to try to get me to join their particular belief system, I am just looking for a place to start to 1) educate myself on different Christian and non-Christian beliefs and practices, and 2) some amount of guidance in how to reflect upon myself. If anybody has any recommendations, particularly ones that are somewhat nondenominational, that would be fantastic. Also, I would love to hear people's journeys toward religious beliefs.

Thank you to anybody who takes the time to read this or give recommendations.

TLDR; I have considered myself agnostic, but would love to hear some nondenominational recommendations on how to begin exploring religion.",1602968253.0
religion,How would your religion react to the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence?,"Some atheists have speculated on how the religious may react to such a discovery. I've heard that most would have no problem with it (besides maybe the flat earthers). Personally, I think there's more to it than just how the religious will fit this into their worldview. How would they react to aliens? I'm fairly certain you would see at least some Christians and Mormons trying to convert them. On the other hand, some aliens may even try to convert US (assuming they have religions of their own of course). 

I'm only familiar with the New Atheist perspective that all religion is outdated and will be abandoned in the future. Of course, their predictions have obviously failed to come true. Beyond that, they also propose that the existence of aliens could pose theological issues. I mean, in the case of Christianity, they believe that people who don't know of Jesus' existence have no chance of going to heaven. What may they think of aliens who almost certainly won't be Christian? Of course, atheists assume that all divine revelation is false, and therefore all religions of Earth should in theory be unique to Earth. I'm guessing at least some religious people will think aliens will also practice Earth religions; I even recall once on TV some guy speculating that aliens will probably have their own version of Jesus (he clearly assumed that Jesus would manifest on all worlds in one form or another). 

Yeah, this question is tricky since the religious will likely have a very different idea of what that day may be like than atheists would. I mean, we even have UFO religions on this planet who will no doubt view this first contact as their 'gods' (for lack of a better term) finally arriving. I know there's also some conspiracy-minded Christians out there that think UFOs are just demons in disguise. No doubt they would see alien visitors as literal demons, and make quite a lot of noise about it too.

I'm not really sure how productive this is going to be, but I guess it would still be interesting to see.

So I guess this question is two-fold: what would your religion think of the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence. Also, what would you expect to find? Would you seriously expect to find aliens that worship the Abrahamic God in some form? What would you think if we found none? Would you seriously try to convert an alien? If you're a more open religion like Hinduism, would people be attempting an inter-faith dialogue with them? What would you make of them? So many questions...",1602954876.0

religion,Is it possible to be religious without committing errors in reasoning?,"Before anyone gets upset: **this post is not intended as an attack**. I am asking this out of a genuine desire to know what people think.

As an atheist, I have yet to encounter an argument in defense of someone's religious belief which does not commit at least one logical fallacy or other error in reasoning. This observation is largely why I consider myself an atheist. However, I am open to the possibility that one can be religious without making such errors; I would like to know if anyone can present an example.

Again: not trolling, I am genuinely interested in an answer.

Edit: I think at least one respondant has asked for examples of errors in reasoning. Here is a non-exhaustive list of errors I have heard made by religious people, which I think most people would agree are errors:

* I believe this, therefore it is true.
* I was taught this from a young age, therefore it is true.
* This belief makes me feel good / makes me a better person, therefore it is true.
* Many other people hold this belief, therefore it is true.
* This belief is based on an ancient book / historical documents, therefore it is true.
* This belief is based on a personal subjective experience, therefore it is true.
* This belief is based on a logical argument which makes sense to me, therefore it is true.
* I cannot make sense of the world without this belief, therefore it is true.
* This belief cannot be proven wrong, therefore it is true.
* This belief does not contradict reality, therefore it is true.
* I am deliberately discounting evidence that does not support my belief, therefore it is true.
* I cannot know anything is true with absolute certainty, including this belief, therefore it is true.
* This belief makes more sense than competing beliefs, therefore it is true.
* This belief requires of me that I do not question it, therefore it is true.
* This belief involves my being rewarded after I die, therefore it is true.
* This belief doesn't impact my life in any significant way, therefore it is true.

Edit 2: some respondents have called me out for being argumentative, rigid and attached to reason and logic at the expense of personal meaning and emotion. Please rest assured that I am merely trying to get at the reasons behind what people believe, and evaluate whether they are good reasons or not. In real life I am much friendlier and easygoing, and less overtly concerned about logic and reason, than you might be led to believe by the discussions attached to this post; I’m being argumentative for the sake of finding out how people think.",1602901515.0

Anyways I just recently read an article about Yemen's forgotten war and how it has the most malnutritioned people living there. High child mortality etc. They are living in a hell that I imagine to be worse than the biblical hell. 

I try and tell myself that this is not gods will but the people who are choosing to be against god . But what have the children got to do with this? I'm sure the people over there are very religious and pray 5 x a day (muslim) despite their prayers not being answered. I just really don't understand how God in heaven , almighty , all knowing, most merciful can watch this going on without interfering. Atleast for the children. Million people on this planet will never experience happiness because  of all these never ending atrocities. At Frist I was  greatful and thanked god that I am in a much better place.

religion,Need Help Understanding Salvation,"Hello, everyone.

Before I dive into the meat of my problem, I want to clarify my current position. I don't necessarily consider myself to be a Baha'i, but I find that the Baha'i position on the oneness of world religions just makes sense. God is beyond our human understanding, so it doesn't make sense for us to try to limit Him with religiosity, dogma, etc.

That said, I find myself having something of a crisis of faith. I believe that Jesus was God's Son, and I believe that He was Divine, but not in the way that most do. I believe that Jesus' Divine attributes were manifestations of the Holy Spirit within Himself. Because He was so righteous, sought God with every breath, and lived without sin, He was able to connect more closely to God and thereby manifest more of God's power, through the indwelling Holy Spirit.

So, I do still believe in Christ as Lord and Savior, but not as most Christians do. Rather than believing that Christ's death on the cross is our salvation, I believe it was His teachings that saved us. He taught us how to love, how to give of ourselves, how to heal, and how to come closer to God. If we follow Him, and live in this way, we are accepting His Lordship, which in turn grants us salvation, because it pulls us away from our selfish, sinful nature, and helps us become the people God wants us to be.

Finding this understanding of Jesus has lead me to feel as though I've gone astray. Like I'm losing faith and perhaps trusting a lie. YET, after I came to this understanding of Jesus and started living by the mantra of ""Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds,"" I have found myself becoming a better person. I am becoming less selfish, I am more forgiving, I am not so quick to anger, and I see the good in every person. I see human beings as human beings, rather than godless sinners or anything like that. We're all just people. Some of us are more messed up than others. But, that doesn't make them less than, they just need more help than the rest.

So, I guess my question is, why do I feel like I'm losing my way, when the spiritual fruits I've manifested, would suggest the polar opposite?",1602855237.0

religion,Following the teachings of Jesus helped me overcome my social anxiety...,"From birth I was quite the socially awkward kid. I never dove deep into making a lot of friends and I tented to keep quiet for most of my days leading all the way up through high school. I guess this is what happened (more so in my young adult years) as a result of thinking too much about what others thought of me. Thus, leading me into a more closed off or unwilling to open up kind of spirit.

But then I hit what seemed to be rock-bottom in life. I was addicted to drugs and had no ambitions. I was completely lifeless and had no desire for anything that didn't revolve around making myself more comfortable. I saw myself as someone who was going nowhere and this scared me. Scared me so much that I called out to God and asked Him to lead me where I needed to go. Although at the time I was more or less atheist...

Through my calling out I discovered the teachings of Jesus in the four Gospels. How He taught us to get out into all the world and help those in need spiritually and physically through peace and love. This inspired me as I thought about other people on Earth who were suffering just as I was, if not even more. So I set out to share this newfound love from Jesus through dedicating my time to helping others. In return, I found myself meeting tons of people and building lovely relationships that I would have never built if I stayed down in the dumps.

I still struggle with a little anxiety or a want to be closed off until this day. But it has nowhere near the power it used to have over me as I force myself to remember that there are other people out there that need a loving hand.

In summary, after all of my research into the Abrahamic faiths, it doesn't seem possible to know whether Paul or Muhammad is correct. Additionally, if one of them is right and the other is wrong, can God truly judge me fairly for not knowing who is right? It's a leap of faith either way. After some reflection, it also seems like regardless of what religion anyone follows, there are miracles, people feel their prayers are answered, people feel more fulfilled, etc. So I have now been considering that 1. If there is a God, he either doesn't care or he helps any devoted person regardless of belief 2. There is no God and we're just wired as humans to respond positively to religious devotion. At the moment, I continue to believe in the Abrahamic God but I have no idea where to go from there. An answer seems impossible.  My friends tell me that I'll read myself into atheism. Maybe they're right. I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice from persons of any religion.

Long post:

I was born to a Roman Catholic mother and an Atheist father. I was raised Roman Catholic, attended religious instruction, went to church every Sunday but began identifying with agnosticism at some point in my mid-teens. I've always been fascinated by history(European history specifically). The history of the Roman Catholic began to interest me and from that point, I was instilled with a strong respect for the church and the religion. Still, I considered myself an agnostic, but I made it clear that I intended to keep the traditions of the church and live as a cultural catholic. I stayed this way until the end of high school.

During my first year of college, somehow my ideas on religion changed. What was formerly a fascination with the culture that went along with Catholicism, started to become a belief. At this point, I believed in God 100%. I went through some hyper-religious phases of fasting and prayer. I was reading theology and studying church positions on issues. However, for the most part I was still an agnostic in practice. Since my childhood, I have not attended church regularly. Sin was still a part of my life in college. I drank, I had pre-marital sex, I tried other things, but my belief in God never left me. I always planned to repent and turn to religion later.

This mindset continued throughout sophomore and most of the junior year. At that point, I became much more interested in finding the truth, rather than just committing to Roman Catholicism. I started researching eastern orthodoxy in addition to catholicism. I visited orthodox churches, read books, talked to orthodox laymen, and even started to incorporate parts of orthodoxy into my life. During this time, I also started to researched religions like Hinduism, natural religion, and the philosophy of morality without religion. However, none of those spoke to me and I was convinced nearly entirely that Christianity was right, whether it be Catholicism or orthodoxy.

That all came to an end when I was introduced to Islam. Formerly, I only had a distaste for Islam. After all, Islam, it seemed, was always the enemy of the Christian faith. At some point though, I felt a very strong pull toward Islam. For the time, I only researched Islam academically and had no intention of converting. However, during the pandemic, I was doing a lot of bible study and I decided to buy a Quran and exegesis to study as well. I also read books about the role of Jesus in Islam and the Muslim viewpoint on the origins of Christianity. To add to the mess, the bible study I had been reading previously had already made me question the authenticity of the Bible. My former views of Christianity and Islam were shattered.

Suddenly I came to believe that Paul was a fraud. I learned that Paul and his followers basically rewrote the gospels from other sources like Mark and Q. Nothing in the New Testament seemed authentic and even catholic bible researchers promoted these ideas. I came to believe that Paul took the words ""son of God"" out of the Hebrew context and implanted them into a pagan world where a God could literally have a son. It also just seemed silly to trust this Saul of Tarsus who 1. never met Jesus in person 2. fell off his horse and claims he met Jesus 3. persecuted Christians 4. was disliked by nearly every apostle that did meet Jesus personally. Paul was at odds with the Jerusalem Church every step he took. So why did this guy have so much say in the writing of the bible and the law and the theology of Christianity?

At this point, I began to believe that Islam was true(**I never officially converted**) because Islam sufficiently answers all of those questions. They believe that Paul led Christians astray, and groups like the Ebionites, who believed Jesus was a prophet and messiah but not God, were true Christians. I started arguing with Christians and telling them how they were wrong about Christianity. However, something that always came up from Christians was the idea that Muhammad was a schizophrenic, a liar or just power-hungry.

This is where I'm at now. I've realized that I can't, in good faith, call Paul a fraud and discredit Christianity. I realized that the arguments I would use against Christians can actually be applied to Islam. If I can't trust that Paul fell off of his horse and saw Jesus, how can I believe that the angel Gabriel came to Muhammad in a cave? It's totally possible that they were both just either schizophrenic or men that wanted power for themselves. Then we have the argument about the Bible. Supposedly the Bible was rewritten and edited by Paul and Pauline Christians. If we can't believe that Paul, who assumedly met Jesus during his fall, would edit the Bible in a correct manner, how can we trust that Othman, who was only a man, preserved and promulgated the correct version of the Quran after he burnt every other copy? There are other arguments but I don't want this to go on much longer. 

In summary, after all of my research into the Abrahamic faiths, it doesn't seem possible to know whether Paul or Muhammad is correct. Additionally, if one of them is right and the other is wrong, can God truly judge me fairly for not knowing who is right? It's a leap of faith either way. After some reflection, it also seems like regardless of what religion anyone follows, there are miracles, people feel their prayers are answered, people feel more fulfilled, etc. So I have now been considering that 1. If there is a God, he either doesn't care or he helps any devoted person regardless of belief 2. There is no God and we're just wired as humans to respond positively to religious devotion. At the moment, I continue to believe in the Abrahamic God but I have no idea where to go from there. An answer seems impossible.  My friends tell me that I'll read myself into atheism. Maybe they're right. I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice from persons of any religion.",1602786348.0
religion,Question regarding claim by professor," Okay, So I'm in a sociology class and my professor brought up religion. And I informed her that Hebrews where not white, when she brought up that religion the bible has always been in favor of white males. We went back and forth a bit  and she brought up translations and religion, being something of a facination of mine I tried to point out that the new testament was actually written in the Latin language originally, not Hebrew, and I forget how it came up but she asked, ""did you know that the virgin births original translation was about a lamb, not Mary, and that Mary wasn't the virgin birth. I responded with no it wasn't, because one; Mary wasn't the one born to a virgin, two; the account has historical significance even when you don't consider it divine and was originally transcribed in the new testament to give reference to a man who was inevitably named Jesus, and followed by actual historical figures whom wrote, sometimes poetically sometimes straight forward, a series of personal testaments to this literal man. I thought maybe she was saying that it was taken from another religion where a virgin lamb gave birth to a divine being, or as always possible, my understanding was wrong and the latin bible talked about a virgin lamb that got translated differently when brought over to the english language. My research has yielded nothing that supports what she was talking about from any source historical or theological, it's as if she dreamed the explanation for the history of the bible and then claimed it was fact, until she just kinda trailed off saying whatever, (I assume she didn't want to get into a debate over religion with a student)  Now I don't want to get into a debate with her about the merits of the bible, interpretations of the bible, or the truth of it, my interest is in the factual history of the bible. With that said, It seems to me as though she is informing my class of something she just made up in her head, and saying that it has historical fact and backing when there is no evidence for her argument anywhere. So just to gain more knowledge on the subject I am asking, Where dose the assertation that the story of the virgin birth originally gave reference to a lamb from? i cant even find quote ""misinterpretations"" where this is argued. what is she referring to so that I may inform myself on this?

religion,"Someone asked ""how do you justify your belief in God"" and I'd share my answer with you guys here as a post because it is a bit too much for a comment.","As an agnostic who converted to Christianity; first let's not mention religions at all.

There was a start, a beginning, was it big bang? whatever it was. who did that?

In a lab experiment you can do many random things but I doubt you can ever get things accidentally in order and balance even in an small scale, I mean look at the universe, it's a piece of art!

Whoever did that is God. you can be an agnostic but atheism is just blind denial to me (no offence).

Now to get a religious view you have to study the religions, for me it was Christianity (I studied a few religions in depth), I love Jesus, I love that man, the way he lived, his teachings and his love to humanity is exceptional. (ignore the old testament)

I believe in whoever he says and describes as a God.

That's two main reasons you can believe in God, but then there's a third one, an interesting one and what you read from here on is just my research and discussion with those who were in contact with ""them"", I've never contacted them or seen it happen in person.

You can believe in God by seeing the evil, yes, if you study satanism, witchcraft etc. you'll see that people are actually in contact with them.It's like business to them, you make an offering or ""they"" request from you to offer something and in return you get your heart desire, it's not like boom a pile of money appears in middle of the room, instead it usually is just a whisper, a bit of luck, connecting you with someone maybe powerful, suddenly becoming popular etc.

And let me tell you that the relation with them never have an happy ending, several years ago I read somewhere that in India two man dragged a fresh dead body from a graveyard to cook and eat and that probably was one of those ""tasks"" you might get.

I can go on and explain more to you but the point is; if the things about satan is true, if extraterrestrial exist then the existence of a God is proven.

Let's be in the winning side, God side.

religion,Cleric versus Commoner: how Protestant is your religion?,"I grew up as a Catholic, and one of the central tenets of the faith is that the clergy holds the power of scriptural and Church doctrine. The order of the priesthood is what dictates the way of the Mass, the canon, the Catechism (church rule-book), etc. It took me until I was an adult to learn about *sola fide* and *sola scriptura*, among the other Protestant beliefs that act as a foundation for the many branches.


My question is how Catholic or Protestant are you in your religion? This applies to Christians, but also non-Christians. In your religion, how individualistic is it among the community, holy books, and clergy? What kind of social stances does that allow, or guide you towards? Do you believe in similar types of rituals and good works as the Catholic church does, or do you believe more in the belief and grace of God/gods to be the true way?

religion,Does praying trigger voices/ weird dreams for anyone else?,"Hi I don’t know if this is appropriate for this subreddit so I apologize in advanced if it’s not. I don’t know how to start this but for as long as I can remember praying triggers something for me. I have no idea why but after praying I start feeling extremely uneasy. It’s been happening since I was 9. I don’t hear voices at all or have nightmares unless I pray. I had a period of being really religious when I was younger and I use to hear things and have really horrific dreams. I heard a women call my name randomly, thought I was talking to an angel, and had a “demonic” voice that I’d constantly try to block out. All of them are distinct voices. When I was younger I believed I was talking to an angel until it told me that it was ok to lie then I got the feeling that I shouldn’t trust it. The dreams were some of the scariest things I’d ever seen in my life. Just flashes of what I thought was hell things talking to me etc. and when I’d wake up from it Would freak me out and it would take me a while to go back to sleep. Whenever I did go back to sleep I’d see it all again. I know this makes me sound crazy I don’t tell people this for that reason. The only reason this came up again is after years of just not praying not being religious everything stopped and I was completely fine so I wanted to try to pray again. I thought maybe I’d grow out of whatever happened but no I prayed and heard someone calling my name randomly at night again. I just want to point out that while I’m skeptical of religion I don’t believe the voices are real or anything. I know it’s all in my head and I think that’s the scary part, being unable to figure out why it happens. I don’t think real demons and angels or whatever are talking to me but I genuinely have no idea what to think of it. I don’t think I have a mental illness but I can’t afford therapy so I can’t really get an answer there. If I don’t pray for the rest of my life and I don’t have to deal with anything then I 1000% will keep living like that. While I would’ve liked to try Christianity to see if I really believe in it or not I’d rather have my sanity for even if it’s selfish. I just want to know if anyone has ever experienced anything like that involving praying. And if so is there anything I can do about it or do I just avoid it at all cost?

religion,I don't know if I want to be religious,"So lately I've been thinking more about if I want to be religious or not.

I also don't know if I fully want to believe in something, or dedicate myself to a religion.

When I was younger I went to the Jehova's Witness Kingdom Hall with my grandma. I didn't have  a lot of interest in her religion when I was there, but something did kinda intrigue me. I liked to hear stories from the Bible and liked to learn a few things every now and then. But that's about it, it didn't interest me enough to study it further. 

I'm 20 now, I lost my grandma 3 years ago and my mom 2 years ago. Since then I've been desperate to have any connection to them again. And I know my grandma believed with all her heart that we would see each other in Paradise again. I know I really want to believe that, because I want to see her again, but I also  know that that probably won't happen.
My dad (son of grandma I've been talking about) hated being raised in an religious family, that's why he chose not to raise us religiously. He was always discussing things with my grandma, debunking everything. That's why I'm really sceptic. But lately I've been so lost because I lost 2 very important people in my life. Dealing with this grief, trying to find myself again, it's been really hard and I feel like having faith in something, maybe will help. I think i  don't believe in a God or religion for about 90%. But that other 10% is bugging me. That 10% wants to believe, wants to have faith. Someone or something to lean on. I would like to be part of a community, but I also don't want to be part of a community and have certain expectations to fulfill and rules to follow. And I know my dad is gonna bug me about it too. Everyone around me are atheists, so I can't talk really talk about it with anyone.

My parents chose not to raise me with any faith, so when I was a kid I would spend lots of time reading up on them and practiced quite a few.

religion,"The God of the Bible, scripturally, is able to prevent rape but is not willing. He is therefore malevolent. I will use the Epicurus' trilemma to demonstrate the malevolence of God.","Before you begin reading this, watch this Q&amp;A with Christopher Hitchens, where he is against 4 Christians.

[Christopher Hitchens on unfairness and rape at Book Expo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO2K3sGXWFI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=pop)

I will be using the **Epicurius** argument to prove my point:

&amp;#x200B;

**“Is  God willing to prevent evil, but not able?**

**Then he is not omnipotent.**

**Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.**

**Is he both able and  willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing?**

**Then  why call him God?”**

&amp;#x200B;

Before  I get into the argument I  would just give my thoughts first on this  sensitive topic. I don't  agree with the religious people that say God  detests the act of raping  girls, because in the Bible God himself  commits and abets the act of  rape. Sure in Genesis the men of Sodom and  Gomorrah desired to rape the  angels that were visiting them, and God  killed them for such acts. But  then throughout the Bible God is the one  doing the raping, thinking  about rape, and aiding and abetting men to  rape women.

I  always see  Christians of all stripes saying ""God will have vengeance  on the  priests/pastors that abused their positions and raped"". But I  look at  these people and cannot help but laugh at the irony. I don't  see it that  way. Sure he can punish people for sins since he's  omnipotent, but I  don't particularly find it awe inspiring nor amazing  grace that a rapist  himself is the one that wants to punish other  rapists. It isn't like  there aren't rapists in heaven, see David.

Ah,   but we are told that this just shows the efficacy of the blood of   Jesus! There is power in the blood after all, he saveth the sinner from   their sin. Again this notion, when I was a Christian, seemed amazing   grace to me. The blood of Jesus is so powerful it can wash away the sins   of a rapist.

But then I learned God himself commits [rape](https://www.reddit.com/user/MelodicEarth2/comments/iui7a3/it_is_immoral_for_christians_to_tell_people_of/) in the Bible and worse... he [hurts](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/izvk2q/did_you_know_that_in_the_bible_god_had_children/) children in the [worst](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ijy840/the_biblical_god_has_the_same_morality_as_jeffrey/) ways possible.

All   my time as a Christian I believed that the God who was telling people   they were sinners and threatening them with eternal torment was himself   pure, clean, holy, and definitely not a rapist.

If he wasn't then he would fall into the same category of these people he singles out:

**""You     hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you   will   see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.""   (Matthew  7:5)**

Before     you accuse others of being sinners, take care of your own sins, deal     with your own faults before you desire to point out that which you find     in others.

**""You, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?"" (Romans 2:21)**

&amp;#x200B;

But   it turns out the God of the Bible is a rapist. All of a sudden I  didn't  care for his salvation, or his always pointing the finger at  human  beings for being sinners, etc. The one sending people to hell has an infinitely worse character than the ones he is sending there. I realized this God I was worshiping was more like a clown.

It   turns out YHWH was no different than the barbaric gods of other  cultures  that also rape (see Zeus, etc). In context, one punishes men  by having  their sexual property (women) raped by others, and one seeks  to pleasure  himself through rape.

Is  it ever  okay to rape a girl? Is it okay to rape them as punishment? To  have them  raped for the sins of their husband? Can you tell me?  Because no matter  how long you dodge this question, the Christian must  concede that there  are times when it is permissible for a woman to be  raped.

I give you the first evidence with Abimelech, where God intervened in the sexual activity and prevented it from happening:

&amp;#x200B;

**Case #1:** Abimelech

In   Genesis 20:1-18 Abraham and his wife, Sarah, stay in Gerar, Land of    Abimelech, for a little while. Abraham, scared that the men of the land    will kill him so that they could have Sarah, disguises Sarah as his    sister. Sarah catches King Abimelech’s eye, and he has her brought to    his place. There, depending on the translation, it goes like this:

*But God came to Abimelek* *in a dream* *one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead* *because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”*

*4* *Now    Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will you destroy  an   innocent nation? Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and  didn’t   she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear    conscience* *and clean hands.”*

*6* *Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so* ***I have kept*** ***you from sinning against me***. *That is why I did not let you touch her.* *7* *Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet,* *and he will pray for you* *and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die.”*

I    boldened that one part of God’s speech because this is truly   disturbing. God  says that he actively (and personally) kept Abimelech   from  sinning. So, why would God intervene here but not in the previous   instance? Also, why does God only  intervene in this instance? Why not   intervene and prevent sin (or rape)  from happening at other times? 

((I   would  like to note that every translation I checked so far has had  God  use  active language when describing him stopping Abimelech from   sinning.  This particular translation is NIV. In KJV God   says “withheld”, and both  ESV &amp; CSB use “kept”.))

**Case #2**: Judges 21, God does not stop his people from going about and kidnapping and breeding daughters against their will.

Judges 21:

The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah: “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.”

**2** The people went to Bethel, where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly. **3** “Lord, God of Israel,” they cried, “why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?”

**4** Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.

**5** Then     the Israelites asked, “Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed   to   assemble before the Lord?” For they had taken a solemn oath that    anyone  who failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah was to be put    to death.

**6** Now     the Israelites grieved for the tribe of Benjamin, their fellow     Israelites. “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel,” they said. **7** “How     can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an     oath by the Lord not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?” **8** Then     they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble     before the Lord at Mizpah?” They discovered that no one from Jabesh     Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly. **9** For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.

**10 So     the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to   go   to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there,  including   the  women and children. 11 “This is what you are to do,”  they said.   “Kill  every male and every woman who is not a virgin.”  12 They found   among the  people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred  young women who   had never  slept with a man, and they took them to the  camp at Shiloh in   Canaan.**

**13** Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon. **14** So     the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of    Jabesh  Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of    them.

**15** The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel. **16** And     the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin    destroyed,  how shall we provide wives for the men who are left? **17** The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. **18** We     can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have   taken   this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’ **19** But     look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, which lies     north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem,   and   south of Lebonah.”

**20 So     they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the  vineyards    21 and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to  join in the    dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize  one of them to  be   your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin.  22 When their  fathers   or brothers complain to us, we will say to  them, ‘Do us the  favor of   helping them, because we did not get wives  for them during  the war. You   will not be guilty of breaking your oath  because you did  not give your   daughters to them.’”**

**23 So     that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing,     each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they     returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in  them.**

The   Benjamites  were one of the actual  twelve  tribes of Israel, and the   combined  armies of Israel slaughtered  every  Benjamite man, woman, and   child,  except for six hundred soldiers  who  escaped into the hills.

&amp;#x200B;

The     next  day, feeling that genociders remorse we’re all familiar with,    they   decide to fix up the escaped soldiers with new wives (but none  of    their  own daughters, of course). So they go to a town of  Israelites   who  chose  not to participate in the genocide, and here’s  what   happened:

&gt;“So      the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to    go   to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there,   including   the  women and children. “This is what you are to do,” they   said.  “Kill  every  male and every woman who is not a virgin.” They   found  among the  people  living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young   women who  had never  slept  with a man, and they took them to the camp   at Shiloh  in Canaan.  Then the  whole assembly sent an offer of peace   to the  Benjamites at the  rock of  Rimmon. So the Benjamites returned   at that  time and were given  the women  of Jabesh Gilead who had been   spared.” -  Judges 22:10-14

So      this an explicit case where the Israelites killed off thousands of     their  fellow Israelites simply so they could steal virgins to give  as    ""wives""  in order to restart the Tribe of Benjamin. Oh, and since  they    didn’t  have enough for all the remaining Benjamites, they went  to a    second town  and just kidnapped a bunch of girls.

Sometimes   a non-answer is an answer in and of itself. Nowadays they say God   doesn't talk as much since he's given us his book the Bible. So they   have an excuse right now for why God doesn't stop rapes, etc (except   he's omnipotent). But how about during these times during the Bible?

And    before you bring up the excuse that ""There was no king in Isreal"" at    the time of Judges 21, and thereby try to justify these behaviors,    consider:

1. God already commits, enables, endorses, decrees and has the mind of a rapist. Even without Judges 21.

In    the case with Abimelech, God actually stopped wrongful sexual    activity from happening. So an omnipotent  sovereign God who doesn't   even need to lift a finger to stop rapes or  these kind of activities   from happening or even entering a person's  mind, decided it was okay   for these men to do this, for his people to  kidnap innocent girls at a   festival and rape against their will.

&amp;#x200B;

Now compare case #1 and #2 to the final case, the story which we find in the book of Samuel.

This    is an ""opposite"" case from the one we have seen with Abimelech. In   this case, God actually willed for these young men to continually have    sexual relations with the women of the temple. God willed for it to    happen and they did not stop because **it was God's will to put them to  death**. They would not even heed the voice of their father due to what God was doing to them.

1    Samuel 2:22-25 -- ""Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that   his  sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women  who  were  serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting. And he said  to  them,  “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings  from  all  these people. You must stop, my sons! The reports I hear  among the   LORD’s people are not good. If someone sins against a man,  God will   mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who  can intercede   for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of  their father, for   it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.""

So   God uses women as ""instruments of damnation"" in order to ultimately   bring about the deaths of, and to morally corrupt these young men. That   is consistent with how the Bible treats/views women elsewhere. As we've   seen, they are  viewed as the sexual property of their husbands, the   same as cattle or houses. Of course harlots like Jezebel are denounced   in scripture, but when God desires to put to death some young men he   will do it through the same harlotry.

So one case  where God stops sexual activity from happening, and one case where God  forces it to happen.

He   had no problem in  helping   Pharaoh  be a     dictator by   continually  hardening his heart, so  why   doesn't God help      people   in a  similar manner? Why kill the children    and the pregnant        mothers  of the people he dislikes, instead of helping them     spiritually and        morally? The opposite God did with Pharaoh?   Instead  of  hardening  his       heart, softening their hearts so they   become  better  people,  and   open     their eyes to love? Is this so  unreasonable to ask of an  omnipotent God?

Again,  an   omnipotent God who claims that he is ""Love"", ""Just"", ""Righteous"",    doesn't even need to lift a finger to stop mass rapes like that which  we  saw  in Judges 21 from happening. But he **chose** not to.

&amp;#x200B;

**God is able to stop rapes but he is unwilling.**

**“Is    God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.    Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able  and   willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing?  Then   why call him God?”**

**-Epicurius**

God **is able to stop rape** and does so in one instance in scripture, in the other instances he is the one bringing about the rapes.

He is able to prevent rape, but **not willing to.** He is **malevolent**   \-- Judges 21: God sees men plotting their rapes, going through with  it,  kidnapping and then raping girls in his name, but he does not stop   them.

My own thought is that God   is more than just allowing for this to happen, he is hoping and willing   for it to happen, for the Benjamites **needed** to have offspring or else their tribe would perish, verse 17: ""**The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.""**   I say God is having his thoughts heard by the voices of these   Benjamites. Just because he's silent, doesn't mean he really is. But   since it would be awkward for God to outright say, ""Go and capture those   girls and you can rape them"", oh my bad, I mean ""You can **make them** your **wives**,   and then have intercourse with them"", he goes with this method. Of   course this is just my thought and you can call it a weak argument which   I agree it is, but on the other hand I already know God in other  places  explicitly tells his men to rape women so as far as I'm  concerned,  knowing what I already know about God's character in  scripture, this  completely makes sense.

**He is able but not willing**. Only when his most choice pupils come in danger does he stop it from happening. He shows partiality.

**You   either have a God who sends child rapists to rape children or you have  a  God who simply watches it and says, 'When you're done, I'm going to   punish you.' If I could stop a person from raping a child, I would.   That's the difference between me and your God.' (Tracie Harris)**",1602693260.0

religion,Is religion is the purest manifestation of culture?,"We can define culture as the beliefs and traditions of certain groups, music, art and science can vary greatly from a culture to other. Religion stands out as a greater manifestation than those I cited before. Religion represents the core values that keeps the society that ""created"" or ""discovered"" it a functional system. In the entire human history there was never a atheist culture, even the modern cosmopolit and urban western civilization isn't a atheist civilization. Christianity, that dominated western life for more than a millenia, was replaced by the blind faith in **progress.** The concept of a continuos progress of a free democratic society is what keeps the political and cultural system of the western world working. In the same line of thinking, we can see several cultures in our world, none of them had a religion before they had a culture. Culture is the first manifestation of complex human thought, religion is the set of rules that the culture sees as essential to its survival. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently took up reading The Decline of the West, by Oswald Spengler. In this book the author suggest that Islamic culture existed before the coming of Mohammed, to me (born in a latin country) this sounded absurd at first. Then the author explains that the coming of Mohammed created the possibility of mobilization of something that already existed, the magian culture, but had (up to that point) no reason to exist. The imense succes of the early muslim expansion is a consequence of the culture finding its meaning through a system of belief, perfectly organised to represent the collective mind of the people who were **meant** to follow it. Chistianity is no different, initially a Semitic religion this faith found its people in the germanic and slavic tribes that migrated into western an eastern Europe, and was organized to represent them in the most able manner. 

&amp;#x200B;

This may sound absurd, but religion is not a simple social criation, as some modern scholars attempt to portray it. Religion is the metaphysical representation of the collective conscience, it cannot be controlled by the rulling classes, **it controls the rulling** **class**. It is impossible to create a religion, no single person can do this action. Religion is either a collective manifestation or it is nothing. There can be no individual prophet, Christ died in the cross because he preached to jews and hellenics, neither  were culturally interested in him. Mohammed was such a successful conqueror and prophet becase he preached to muslims, **before they knew they were muslims**. Had Christ preached to germanic and slavic tribes he would have never been persecuted, he would have been the first Pope.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, I do not see religion as only a pure form of culture. I see religion as something that legitimizes a culture, something that makes a culture reach its zenith. I find myself deeply saddened in seeing the top academic minds in the west treat religion as a representation of backwardness and obscurantism. Every single culture that currently exists survived, partially, due to the capacity of its religion in providing guidance to its ""members"". Spengler suggested that cultures decay, enter in the  phase of civilization, and then wither away. I see part of our **cultural** world whithering away, this does not mean a catastrophe, it just means that something new shall replace the old. Aldous Huxley spoke of a world were its citizens lived controlled by hedonism and senseless entertainment, perhaps it will be impossible to escape this fate. When this civilization finally ends a new culture may emerge, with some new faith to represent it.

My question is however, what evidence exist for the validity of the bible, or the Quran, or any religious text/religious belief. 

You can maybe assume that if there was a creator that it was a somewhat violent or competitive one considering that’s what drives evolution, inter species (and intraspecies) competition and violence.

When I was searching for my verses (I had to grab my old Bible off my bookshelf to find it), I stumbled on a couple verses that gave me pause.

Now, for context, I’ve been drifting further and further towards atheism (if people ask I tell them I’m agnostic) since my early teens. I’m 17 now and was raised Lutheran.

Anyway, I realized how weird some of these verses sound now that I’m not believing them. For example, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, “Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.” This is wrapping up a section on sexual immorality, and it rubs me all kinds of wrong ways. 

Another one that struck me was John 21:25, “Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.” Like, as someone that writes as a hobby and watches a lot of anime, this either sounds like the worst cop-out to try to show how powerful their main character is, or a bad translation of that.

religion,I'm having trouble with understanding a mixture of science and religion. Specifically Christianity,"So i'm having trouble with understanding a mixture of science and religion. Specifically Christianity.

Most scientists believe Darwin's theory of evolution, and all scientific evidence supports that theory, so all animals originally came from the ocean and evolved into the many different species we know today. But in the bible, it's phrased that everything was created (creationism), not evolved (evolution).

And yes, I know that the first 7 days weren't actual days, but time periods. In the bible, it is stated that the first man and woman were Adam and Eve. But if humans and chimpanzees once shared a common ancestor, and humans evolved into a different species, there is no way there could only be one man and one woman right? There would have to multiple beings for that to happen, so were Adam and Eve made up? At what point in evolution did humans start going to heaven? If humans go to heaven, then why don't other animals if we all evolved from watery creatures? How would we know if religions were only created because people were too afraid of dying and wanted something to look forward to after death? How come humans (and other extinct species of human) are the only beings to believe in some sort of God?

Jesus. How do we know he wasn't just some dude who happened to be a great philosopher or great at telling speeches or just plain crazy? I know that for the first 30 years of his life he was a carpenter, and he only preached for the last 3 years of his life. In the bible it states ""Do not put the Lord, your God to the test"". Couldn't that be a rule someone made up so people didn't ask questions? Apparently, God speaks to people in the bible. How come nobody hears him today? When people say""it's a calling from God"", isn't that their own decision or thought that they believe is a god? And visions in the old testament, couldn't they have just been hallucinations? When angels came down from heaven, (hallucinations) how do we know they didn't just have a weird dream, or crazy, or were drunk on something, or trying to get famous because of it? How do we know certain things in the bible aren't just mere coincidences or luck?

If God is the creator of the universe, and if , would God send other ""Jesuses"" to different worlds? If an alien being came here and suggested a new God, what would happen? Who would be right?

Who's to say we even have souls? What evidence proves that we have an ""inner spirit"", and that we're not just a bag of flesh of bones? Who's to say when we die, that it's just a ""black out"" and that's it?

religion,Is Christianity (Specifically Catholicism) actually kinda polytheistic?,"Hi, first of all I'm predominantly agnostic and this post isn't to give hate to christians or anything, it's just an observation I have and I may be wrong.

I always lived in Argentina, which is a majority Catholic country (But to be fair, a very secular one, were most people are culturally christians but not religious). As that, and as I was catholic for my first years before switching to atheism and finally to agnosticism, I'm fairly familiar with it's beliefs and practices. And a practice that was very common is the cult to saints. There are thousands of saints, and, at least in my experience, they even seem more important that Jesus itself. People pray to saints to have things. There is a church in Buenos Aires dedicated to San Cayetano, and every year (Around August, I don't remember the exact date) hundreds, maybe thousands of people go to that church to pray to that saint to have a job. Near my house there's one dedicated to San Pantaleón, and people pray him to be cured from sickness.

So, after this, how is this different from polytheism? The saints aren't called as ""gods"", but their function is basically the same. There are churches dedicated to only one of them, how in polytheistic religions there is a specific temple for Zeus, or Shiva or Odin; they have different attributes, as Zeus is god of thunder and Ares of war; and people pray them for obtaining things, like polytheists do to their gods. Even people have icons of the saints in their houses or symbols of them, similar to having an altar for a god or amulets asociated with them.

So how is this not polytheistic or, at least, henotheistic? What differentiates San Cayetano from Zeus or Vishnu? 

As a disclaimer, I'm not saying this disproves Christianity. I'm agnostic, I don't believe in it but I accept the possibility of a god or gods being real, but it confuses me that Catholicism is regarded as Monotheistic when this practices are very polytheistic.

religion,I'm not sure if I'm heading in the right direction.,"I used to 'study' religions when I was young. Like, really young. I loved understanding the different ideals and cultures and how human beings interpreted the world.
But nothing ever stuck. Sure I liked bits and peices of what people made and their thoughts on what lies beyond but nothing was ever satisfying.

I spent my teens frustrated and misinterpreting texts. Suitably edgy and rebellious of me. I worry that's what I'm still doing occasionally.
I have never felt the ""call of the Divine"" or something akin to a ""Calling"". I was and still am largely without a true zeal and passion. The closest I've ever come to a religious moment was walking through the New York Library just before it closed with no one around.

Partially out of pragmatism and partly out of a sense of desperation, I have begun formulating my own religious beliefs. An educational system of secular religion, but even calling that feels wrong.
Human beings need faith, belief. I truly believe that. I've seen the holes people dig themselves into when they have faith in nothing, not even themselves. Too often I've seen people succumb to depression, various addictions and every form of abuse to fill that empty feeling, or chase a temporary high. Yet faith and belief gives people the fortitude to fight on, even when they shouldn't, to sacrifice themselves for someone they'll never know.
Human beings will always be human beings, but I've seen the heights we can grow to when given to faith, when bound together through that faith. It's beautiful.

Aside from the characteristics that make someone a genuine friend, like going great lengths for a friend’s sake, here are seven Bible verses that share honest and beautiful truths about this special kind of bond.

1.Proverbs 18:24 (Revised Standard Version)

&gt;There are friends who pretend to be friends, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

Not all friends are true friends. But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

2.Proverbs 17:17 (Revised Standard Version)

&gt;A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

Real friendship offers love that is enduring and is there through both good and bad times.

3.Proverbs 27:6 (Revised Standard Version)

&gt;Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy.

A true friend gives honest and helpful criticisms.

4.Proverbs 16:28 (Revised Standard Version)

&gt;A perverse man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends.

Be careful: Talebearers can ruin even great friendships.

5.Proverbs 27:10 (Revised Standard Version)

&gt;Your friend, and your father's friend, do not forsake; and do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity.

Don’t forget your friends as well as your father’s friends.

6.John 15:13 (Revised Standard Version)

&gt;Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

No greater love is there than a man giving his life for his friends.

7.John 15:15 (Revised Standard Version)

&gt;No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.

The Lord Jesus Christ can be a friend you can always count on.

religion,Christian apologetic sources cannot be trusted as they are dishonest in their work and purposely suppress information in order to lead astray those who are unsuspecting enough to believe them," 

Let's take the example of the Genocide of Midian.

""So   kill all the boys and all the women who have had intercourse with a   man.  Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them   for yourselves."" **(Numbers 31:17-18)**

I   was talking to someone about this verse and he, like many other   religious people, bring up the idea that these girls weren't raped.   They were forcibly married to their captors (and then used for  intercourse), maybe at an older age. When you search for religious  apologetics on this verse, this is one of the top links that show up: [https://askjohnmackay.com/divine-rape-how-you-believe-in-god-would-order-girls-raped-in-numbers-31/](https://askjohnmackay.com/divine-rape-how-you-believe-in-god-would-order-girls-raped-in-numbers-31/)

The   apologetic talks about the Isrealite marriage laws for kidnapped,   non-Jewish women. So he tries his utmost to make it appear that this   isn't rape. Murdering the families of these young virgin daughters and   then kidnapping them to ""marry"" them. Call me an evil atheist, but I   think girls should get to choose who they get to marry, and who they   give their virginity to.

Christian   apologists are honest people, at least, that's what I believed when I   myself was Christian. They are men of the good book after all. The book   says lying is a sin. But let's examine what the apologist says about   this:

""**No     act that could be called rape is ever described in Numbers 31. Yet   the   God who ordered Moses to war, who did allow soldiers to take   captive   women as wives, also gave rules for marriage to such captive   women.**   Deuteronomy 21:10 records Moses informing the people that: ""When you go forth to war against your enemies, and **&gt;&gt;*****the Lord your God has delivered them into your hands&lt;&lt;***      and you have taken them captive, and you see among the captives a      beautiful woman, and desire her, and take her for a wife -Then you   shall    bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and   do her    nails, and she shall remove the garment of her captivity from   her,  and   remain in your house and weep for her father and mother a   for  month,  and  after that you may approach her and have intercourse   with  her, and  she  shall be your wife.”

""You   may approach her and have intercourse with her"", God is saying it is   okay to do this to these captured daughters. Did God ever think about   the feelings of these girls? Or are they just sexual property? **The daughter didn't have any say in the matter.**

**To   my surprise, the Deuteronomy verses quoted in the Christian apologetic   article    conveniently left out the last verse where it says the   following:**

""And if you do   not want her, you shall  send her  out  on her own; you shall not sell   her at all for money, you  shall not  treat  her as a slave, because  you  ***violated*** her.""

Just to note again, it says ""if **you** do not want her let her go"", not ""if **she does not want you** let her go"".

At   first you might have thought that the ""intercourse"" mentioned prior   could have been consensual (yeah, I'm sure this kidnapped girl that just   had her parents murdered by these people would have consensual sex  with  these people), but it turns out that God is giving these kidnapped   virgin girls into their hands in order to rape them, or to have them   forcibly married and then raped.

I    will use  the verse which the Christian conveniently and dishonestly   left out to  prove  that the  holy and just God of the Bible is aiding   and abetting mass sexual abuse of daughters. As  you read the Bible,  you  suddenly notice the children of Israel are  precisely all the time   being  ordered to covet.  Being enjoined to covet, being told they must    envy and hope to annex the  lands, the animals and the women and  young   daughters of neighboring  tribes. They kept going by greed, by  the  thought that  soon, all these peoples  properties shall be ours.  And  that we'll be  licensed to take it by  force, and kill them and  have the  land but not  their people. This is  perhaps why there are no   prohibitions against,  say, slavery, **rape**,  genocide, or **child abuse** in the 10 Commandments.

It's     not a matter of leaving these out or applying situational ethics to a     time that was not ours. It's not that. Such things have always been     known of and usually deplored. It's more I fear that such terrible     things as rape, enslavement, genocide and child abuse, were just about     to be mandatory during this time. They're just about to be forced on     people by God, as things they must do if a conquest was to continue.

The biblical text of Deuteronomy 21:10-14 deals with the **treatment of  sexually desirable non-Jewish women who are captured in war**.   It  addresses the **sexual privileges** of the **captors**, as well as the   legal  rights and the process of the socialization into Israelite   society of  the captives.

What is the nature of the sexual act contemplated in Deut. 21:10-14?:

""When you go forth to war against your enemies, and **&gt;&gt;*****the Lord your God has delivered them into your hands&lt;&lt;***      and you have taken them captive, And you see among the captives a      beautiful woman, and desire her, and take her for a wife -Then you   shall    bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and   do her    nails, And she shall remove the garment of her captivity from   her,  and   remain in your house and weep for her father and mother a   for  month,  and  after that you may approach her and have intercourse   with  her, and  she  shall be your wife. And if you do not want her,  you  shall  send her  out  on her own; you shall not sell her at all for   money, you  shall not  treat  her as a slave, because you ""***violated***"" her.

We      shall focus on the expression ""violated her,"" 'initah in Hebrew,   from    the root 'anah. It is in the translation of this word that an      attitudinal difference between the Targumim becomes apparent. In 2      Samuel 13;11-14, the story of Amnon and Tamar, the root 'anah is used      twice: ""do not violate me,"" and then ""he overpowered her, he violated      her, and he lay with her."" If we understand ""and he lay with her""  to     mean ""and he had intercourse with her,"" we may understand from  the     juxtaposition of the two concepts that 'anah can be considered  sexual     violence. That is, in this instance the use of 'anah together  with ""had     intercourse"" seems to imply actual rape.

This      seems to be the case as well in Gen.34:2, the story of Dinah and      Shechem. There the text says: ""He \[Shechem\] took her, and he lay with      \[had intercourse\] with her and he violated her \[vaye'anehah\]."" 'Anah      alone would not mean necessarily rape, but simply sexual violence  of     some sort. Rape is again implied here by the use of 'anah and  ""had     intercourse"" together.

The   idea    of rape may also be expressed with other terminology. In   Deuteronomy    22:25, 28 we find the verb ""had intercourse"" used with  the  verbs ""took    hold of,"" ""grabbed"", to imply the idea of forced  intercourse  i.e.   rape.  The verb 'anah is used alone in Lamentations  5:11, Ezekiel    22:10, and  Judges 19:25, and from the context in these  instances seems    to imply  rape.

We   must   recognize, however,  that though it is important to determine  what  is   meant by 'anah in  Deuteronomy 21:14, rape is only one way of  exerting    sexual violence.  Clearly sexual violence is conveyed in  all the quoted    instances where  'anah is used. Thus although there is  no specific    mention of rape in  Deuteronomy 21:14, the word 'initah  implies that the    woman's consent  (if any) to intercourse was due to  her  circumstances.

The     expression  'initah is particularly poignant, a point that seems to    have  been  recognized in both the Onqelos and Neophyti Targums. Onqelos     actually  uses the root 'anah in his translation, while Neophyti 1  has    ""you  have exercised your power/authority \[reshut\] over her.""  Targum     Pseudo-Jonathan, on the other hand, considers 'anah to be  only actual     intercourse, translating with the verb shamash, and thus  failing to     transmit the Bible's sensitivity to the captive's  powerlessness.

From Jewish sources:

**Rav Yosef says: Come** and **hear** a resolution from a mishna (*Nidda* 44b): A girl who is **three years and one day old** whose father arranged her betrothal **is betrothed with intercourse,** as the legal status of intercourse with her is that of full-fledged intercourse.

My own research from conservative orthodox Jews:

[https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/65726/does-the-talmud-promote-pedophilia](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/65726/does-the-talmud-promote-pedophilia)

Bear    in mind that that website’s answers are generally by Orthodox Jews  and   so should be read as potentially composed with that bias. Like  some of   the quotes are portrayed in a way that doesn’t really show  some of the   ugliness underneath, like the quote saying that relations  with girls  too  young to bear children delays the messiah in context is  because  there  need to be a certain number of Jewish souls born and so  it’s not   productive to have relations with them, or certain places  where the   answer states that someone says it's outright forbidden to  have   relations with girls too young to bear children, the answer  leaves out   that the explicit reason given is that it's wasting seed  and applies to   adult women with a closed womb too, and it misdirects  from this fact by   saying ""safe childbearing age"". You'd see that by  actually going to  the  sources referenced -- [https://www.chabad.org/library/article\_cdo/aid/960669/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twenty-One.htm](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960669/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twenty-One.htm) and [https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan\_Arukh%2C\_Even\_HaEzer.23?lang=bi](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.23?lang=bi)\-- but the answer itself didn't make that easy since it only links to    the Hebrew-only versions. Or it downplays the opinions that say it's    merely discouraged.

Or the Talmudic ban on marrying children leaves out that before then it was not prohibited and not uncommon. See [https://utj.org/viewpoints/responsa/concerning-the-marriage-of-a-minor-girl/](https://utj.org/viewpoints/responsa/concerning-the-marriage-of-a-minor-girl/) for discussion. E.g. the Gemara has stories of women claiming to be married as children, such as [https://www.dafyomi.co.il/nidah/points/ni-ps-045.htm](https://www.dafyomi.co.il/nidah/points/ni-ps-045.htm)

This    is not to say what is generally accepted Halacha, nor that the  halacha   would necessarily reflect the intent of the Priestly source  author of   Numbers 31, just that the Stack Exchange answers given by  the religious   may be light on certain details.

And,    it’s not at all clear that it is just some sort of legal technicality    as it relates to the case in Numbers 31, since the Gemara does seem  to   regard 3 as practically significant as the age above which girls  were   considered fit for relations and thus killed: [https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.60b?lang=bi](https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.60b?lang=bi)

It may have to suffice to say that it’s a really immoral, but dubious, tale.

So   this is what the Christians are hiding from you, and for good reason.   This is something that would deconvert a human being that loves justice   and morality. Christians worship their God because they think he is  love  and just. But this is the opposite of that, this is the opposite  of  Jesus words,

""This is the message we have heard from Jesus and now proclaim to you, that **God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all"" (1 John 1:5).**

I’ve heard this on many bases. Something like “I listen to God I don’t need the stars to tell me about my life. I have the (example) bible.”

I understand that these sort of things are viewed “occult” practices and even in some parts of the world *taboo*. Such as tarot reading, astrology, whatever whatever. I also understand that God’s books (bible, qur’aan etc) are often times taken quite literally in community settings and are very praised. For good reason of course. (Usually lol) 

But... why denounce the planets and stars? Didn’t that same God you love and praise so much *create* those systems? Don’t you think maybe God speaks in other ways, aside from the common and heavily read books? Isn’t the first and most ultimate word of God the physical nature that we humans have found ourselves in, the one God created? 

I just see it like there are so many ways to find and experience God. There are layers. Nature , to me, is one ultimate connection. And that does include the nature of our solar system.

religion,Significance Of Mental Worship,"The world offers numerous distractions, and the human mind is easily drawn to them. Desire-ridden actions do not pacify it. Neither the wealth obtained through the grace of the gods nor the appeasement of sensory pleasures leads to peace of mind, since your mind has a great appetite for desires, and is not easily satisfied. Rituals and sacrificial ceremonies by themselves may keep it distracted from the reality of life, but they cannot permanently cure the afflictions and modifications to which you are susceptible.

Hence, if you want to tame your mind and its numerous drives and desires, you need a better and more powerful approach. It is possible when your mind is directly engaged in divine worship with concentration and devotion. For that, the best technique has so far been the mental worship or manasa puja, also known as spiritual worship or mystic worship, which consists of worshipping God or gods with your mind (manas) and intellect (buddhi).

The Upanishads declare that internal worship (manasa puja) is far superior to external worship. Your prayers are more effective when they are uttered silently in your mind rather than chanted loudly. In imagination and visualization your mind has the power of God to manifest things and enjoy them. It is a creating and manifesting entity, without form and without spatial limits. You can create anything and accomplish any task in your imagination. The Vedas recognize this inherent power of humans, and therefore prescribe mental worship as the best means to develop a close affinity with your personal deity. The Vedic seers approved this practice. Modern masters such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, Yogananda, and Swami Vivekananda found it very useful to grow the divine presence in them.

You are the lord of your inner universe, just as Brahman is of the external. You can set the stage and create necessary conditions within your mind to perform any mental task. You can control that world and all the objects in it with your resolve. Hence, if you set your mind upon it, you would easily manifest your personal God in your inner world and awaken your own spirituality. As you continue the practice, your mind will manifest the same reality in the external world also, and show you the same God hidden in all manifestation. It is why manasa puja is considered a very effective method of internal worship.

Manasapuja is more than dhyana (contemplation) or mindfulness. It is an enhanced and enriched form of dhyana and mindfulness practice, in which you combine ritual worship with concentration, meditation, and devotion to form a personal bond with the deity of your choice. Its continued practice leads to mental purity, stability, concentration, tranquility, and self-absorption. Most importantly, it awakens the deity hidden in you and brings him into the center of your life. He also becomes the silent witness and partner of your thoughts and actions, and will keep you safe from the hazards of karma.",1602395295.0

With Halloween just around the corner what better time to discuss the eleven million phantom Mormons.

While the church publishes worldwide membership numbers at about 16 million, Cumorah.com reports that less than half of those the church counts even identify themselves as Mormon. Assuming that the number of active members is lower than those who would even want to be identified as Mormon, hardly a heroic assumption, the actual functional membership of the LDS church, even ignoring record resignations, is more realistically to be around 5 million men, women, and children. 

The ‘*brethren*’ likes to propagate the myth that the Mormon church is, if not the fastest growing church, one of the fastest growing churches in the world. An unwitting and lazy media repeat this mantra which is blatantly and demonstrably untrue. While at one time growth was greater than it is today, the Mormon church is not now, nor has it ever been the fastest growing religion in the world nor even close.

It’s the big lie and Hitler’s apostle, Joseph Goebbels would be proud. If you tell a lie often enough, it will eventually be accepted as the truth.  The fact is that the growth rate of the Mormon Church is essentially the same as the Catholic church and most Protestant churches in America despite the latter do not employ a huge proselytizing missionary force.

There is a principle of influence often referred to as the *Law of Conformity*. It is what in logic, is called the ‘*bandwagon effect*.’ If you are over forty years of age, you can no doubt remember when every McDonald’s restaurant sign in the world displayed *’30 Billion Served*.’ 

The *Law of Conformity* or social proof is the psychological phenomenon where people reference the behaviors of others to guide their actions. It recognizes that we are social animals. We like what others like. We reject and discard what other people reject and discard. We tend to do what other people do, to follow the pack. We perceive behaviors as being more correct in a given situation to the degree that others view them as accurate. This ‘law’ extends to what we wear, how fast we drive on the freeway, what we buy, and yes, what religion we adhere to.

The Mormon church still perpetuates the myth that the church is experiencing extraordinary growth because it serves their purposes.  However, it is becoming more and more difficult to keep up that façade. The church may actually be in decline. It is in absolute free-fall in Europe. Indeed, if it were not for the current missionary efforts in West Africa and a few parts of South America, even the current paltry growth rate of 1.2% to 1.5% couldn’t be maintained.

Additionally, while the church does not report resignations, some estimate that over 100,000 members officially resign from the church each year, and, of course, many more, just walk away and increase the already enormous inactive ranks. Again, Cumorah.com reports that *“75 percent of foreign \[LDS\] converts are not attending church within a year of conversion. In the United States, 50 percent of converts fail to attend after a year.”*

It is a real challenge to get honest membership statistics from the church itself, there are numerous examples of how inflated their counts are. In Iceland, for example, where every registered religion receives a tax rebate for every member over sixteen (*sóknargjald*) the government reports 162 registered Mormons in 20191 while the church reports on its website 288 members (178% inflation). 2

**Canada:**   
The Mormon church reported in 2001 that there were 160,743 members in that country however the Canadian census in that year showed 93,890 people identified themselves as Mormon. The church over reported Canadian membership by 41.6%. 

2003 Church Almanac, p.298  
2001 Statistics Canada, *Census of Canada*

**Australia:**  
In Australia in that same year the church claimed 102,773 members while the 2001 Census of Australia reported just 48,775 – less than half the number the church published.

Islam is far and away the world’s fastest-growing religion. The number of Muslims on this planet will leap from 1.9 billion in 2018 to 2.76 billion by 2050. At that time, Muslims will make up one-third of the world’s total projected population of about 9 billion people.

Even if we compare Mormonism to Christian denominations, The LDS church’s current dismal growth rate stacks up poorly against that of a great many others.  


**The Church of God in Christ**

In 1965, the COG had 425,000 members. In 2012, the membership was 5,499,875, an increase of 1,194 percent.

**The Presbyterian Church (in America)**

In 1973, the PCA had 41,232 members. In 2013, the membership was 367,033, an increase of 790 percent.

**The Assemblies of God**

In 1965, the AOG had 572,123 members. In 2013, the membership was 3,030,944, an increase of 430 percent.

**The Southern Baptist Convention**  


In 1965, the SBC had 10,770,573 members. In 2013, the membership was 15,735,640, an increase of 46 percent.

Also, the LDS church counts membership differently than Christian churches. In most churches, members are asked to vote on various matters, and so, unlike the Mormon church, these churches do not want to waste their time and resources reaching out to those who no longer have any interest in their churches.

In Mormonism, once someone joins the church, even if they attend one meeting never to return, they are counted on the church’s membership rolls for the rest of their life and in many cases far beyond! 

The majority of those on the Mormon church’s rolls are inactive, so consequently the church is unaware of their passing. The policy of the church is also to assume for tabulation purposes that they all live to 110 years of age.

Even the recent lowering of the missionary age clearly hasn’t stopped the bleeding. Convert retention rates are now even worse than *Jehovah’s Witness’* rates, which used to set the ‘*abysmal continuance standard.’*

So obsessed is the church with bolstering their membership numbers, they add to their membership numbers what they call, ‘*children of record*,’ boys and girls 0 – 7 years-of-age who have not yet been baptized and are therefore not actual members of the church.

The church’s annual report presented during General Conference shows that the LDS church grew by 261,862 people in 2015, a 1.7% annual increase. In 2016, it was even worse 1.58% and in 2017 even worse again 1.48%, and in 2018 it dipped to 1.21%. This is the slowest growth in any year since 1937 (when it was 0.93%).

Mormons are also having fewer children as the most recent statistics show:

New children of record during 2014…….... 116,409  
New children of record during 2015 …..…  114,550  
New children of record during 2016……… 109,246  
New children of record during 2017……… 106,771  
New children of record during 2018……… 102,102  
New children of record during 2019 ……...   94,266

2019 Statistical Report for 2020 April Conference

With a growth rate of 1.21%, convert baptisms flagging, and declining member activity rates – 25% for young single adults, interest in the Mormon church seems to be waning.

The chart below shows the church’s current and its projected membership statistics.

&amp;#x200B;

Active membership in the church which, as this chart shows, is less than 5 million with non-actives more than double that number. Also, the active membership is projected to be virtually the same in 2060 with non-active membership four times active membership. 

In her new book *The Next Mormons*, journalist Jan Riess provides some interesting statistics. In 2007, 70 percent of those raised in the LDS church were still in it as adults, by 2014, it dropped to 64 percent — and among Millennials, it was down to 62 percent. Riess, suggests that such apostasy rates are gaining momentum, and soon, as many as half of Millennials, raised Mormon will leave the faith.

The world population grew by over 80 million people in 2018. The church reports that 195,000 people joined the church in that year. Proportionately, fewer people, not more people on earth are discovering the LDS church each year.

If the church were to release the number of members resigning it would tell an interesting story. But for every member who resigns there are many more that just quietly becoming inactive.

I believe, this new reality, is the reason the Mormon church has wisely taken a page out of Scientology’s playbook, aggressively building its secular empire – malls, raw land, TV stations, corporate ownership and secreting away a 100 billion dollar plus slush fund, in anticipation of the inevitable future downturn in tithing revenues.

Does 1.2% growth, mostly coming from sub-Saharan Africa give credence to Joseph Smith’s bold prophesy?

*“The truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear.”*

For my midlife crisis, I choose to return to the ideals and dreams of my early 20’s.

Given the current world crisis, it is less practical to buy a convertible than it is to secret oneself away, pen to page, and chase the perfect poem.

I am 43 and Jesus would be 2020.

In 2020, I believe that more people are ready for a Spiritual Revolution than they were in the late nineties -- with or without Jesus.

At 43, I’m better at everything than I was when I was 21. The problem has become that I can’t be bothered to do most of it. At this point, I am accustomed to my tastes and don’t relish exercising anything that doesn’t spice my mustard. So, I ask myself, looking back across all the things that have given me good gizzard, “What most sparked my plug?”

That tricky old Spiritual Revolution and that evasive perfect poem.

I’ve whimmed my way down a lot of different dalliances and there was only really one dark shot that I could never hit. Well, only one that I could never see clearly what it would just-right take to nail; there were plenty screws that I didn’t drive, but I could always see the threads -- the real life work and practice that would make a path into an avenue.

But not that Perfect Poem.

Not that daring and darling Spiritual Revolution.

Plenty things I left behind because the work outweighed reward or I had nothing left to prove to myself.

But only two endeavors ever broke me. Only two pursuits brought me to the brink of self-annihilation.

One was selling books door to door.

And the other brought me to the peak of self-actualization in the chase.

I believe in prayer but I haven't prayed for a while because I don't know which god to Adress. 

I grew up in an Islamic household. But when I moved out the Islamic faith sort of faded as I assimilated to western culture. And with all these terror attackers from ""Muslim"" backgrounds I didn't want to be associated so I drifted even more away from it. Deep in my heart I felt there was truth in the teachings of the Quran but what irritates me is that the prayer must be in Arabic. And with my workload going on , I don't know if I can learn Arabic anytime soon. Plus I'm also out of by Arabs how they treat non Arabs who aren't white. So I just don't feel comfortable being in their spaces. I'm half black and half Arab ( my mother and father divorced very early so I couldn't learn the language). My father taught me how to pray though. He  is very concerned about my fading faith in Islam. 

I always knew about Christianity but I haven't been drawn to it until recently. Especially after the dream I had of Jesus and some angels . I started to read more bible passages and somehow felt like I could intensify my knowledge and prayer in a Christian way. But I felt too much of a traitor to my father so I left it. But the thought still lingers... 

My clairvoyant abilities have skyrocketed this year and my friends suspect I may even be a medium. I have indeed predicted three deaths in my family without the use of magic. 
My tarot readings are mostly accurate. My dreams are very vivid and visionary.  I got into magic because unlike Islam and Christianity magic supports and enhances clairvoyant abilities that I surely haven't brought upon myself. 

I read about demonic possession and it's symptoms . I'm afraid May have been possessed last year. I was very erratic and turned very violent quickly. I was depressed and even therapy didn't appear to help. 

The symptoms have decreased now and I believe it's because I may have gotten back to spirituality. Cleansing and banishing bad entities. But it appears that I saw a demon once very vividly. I was thinking I need to be more active on staying clear of that and need prayer. But I don't know to who. Currently I feel more comfort in the bible prayers and psalms. I don't have to worry about the language or the direction of Mecca and can just go ahead and pray.

The idea being that God is love, and hell is the separation from God, therefore being a separation from love.  Looking at the simple theology behind it gives you that much more insight to it.  I think most everyone can agree that if you separate yourself from love, you are going to have a bad time.

religion,"Dear Church, Here’s Why People Are Leaving: by JOHN PAVLOVITZ","Dear Church,

The Exodus has begun and it’s not going to stop.

People are leaving you and they’re probably not coming back.

I’ve been where you are and I know what’s happening within you right now.

I know you’re panicking, scrambling to understand it all, trying to somehow
 stop the bleeding, to reverse the swift and steady tide out the doors.

I know that you hire consultants and hold emergency meetings and plan bold strategies and brainstorm solutions—all designed to engineer a way to bring all the prodigals home, to “reach the young people,” to grow numerically again.

I know you imagine that if you just tweak the songs or shorten the services or get a new sign or rebrand your logo or set up shop in a strip mall; that if you just find the right aesthetic balance of vintage reverence and hipster chic—that this will all magically change your fortunes. 

It won’t.

This attrition is likely irreversible and here’s why:

The departure isn’t about the style of music in your worship services.
It isn’t about the coolness of the coffeeshop facade in the lobby.
It isn’t about the amenities you have or don’t have.
It isn’t about the tricked out tech you’re getting in the sanctuary.
It isn’t about the youthfulness and charisma of your lead pastor.
It isn’t about how many pop culture references you make in your sermons.
It isn’t about the bells and whistles of your new website.
It isn’t about your facilities or your staff or your social media fluency.
It’s isn’t about the sprawling menu of ministries and bible studies you offer.

The people who are gone—aren’t gone because your band wasn’t good enough or because the messages weren’t clever enough or because your production wasn’t tight enough.

They don’t give a damn about such things.

Church, people are leaving you because you are silent right now in ways that matter to them.

You aren’t saying what they need you to say and what you should be saying—and it makes them sick.

They spend their days with a front row seat to human right atrocities, to growing movements of cruelty, to unprecedented religious hypocrisy, and to political leaders who are antithetical to heart of Jesus.

They live with the relational collateral damage of seeing people they love abandon compassion and decency; people who are growing more and more callous to the already vulnerable.

They see in their daily lives and on the news and across their timelines and in their communities, exactly the kind of malevolence and toxicity they expect you to speak into with boldness and clarity as moral leaders—and instead they find you adjusting the stage lights and renovating the lobby and launching websites.

In the middle of the songs and the sermons and the video clips, they can see your feet of clay and your moral laryngitis. That’s why they’re leaving.

I know you’re worried about saying too much, about being branded too political, about offending people or somehow making it worse by speaking.

Trust me, you are making it worse by saying nothing.

Yes, you may be avoiding conflict or keeping a tenuous peace in the pews.
You may be causing less obvious turbulence inside your walls.
You may be appeasing a few fearful folks there who don’t want you to trouble the waters.

But you’re doing something else: you’re confirming for millions of people, why they have no use for you any longer.

You’re confirming the suspicions of those who believe the church has no relevance for them.

You’re giving people who’ve offered you one more chance to earn their presence—reason to walk away.

Your silence right now is the last straw for them.

They’ve been waiting for you to oppose the separation of families,
to declare the value of black lives,
to loudly defend LGBTQ people,
to stand alongside your Muslims brothers and sisters
to denounce the degradation of the planet—
to say with absolute clarity what you  stand for and what you will not abide.

And you have kept them waiting too long.

Church, people can get most of what you offer them somewhere else. They can find meaningful community and entertainment for their families and acts of service to participate in. They can get music and inspiration and affinity and relationships without you.

The singular thing you can offer them is a clear and unflinching voice that emulates the voice of Jesus.

If you really want to be relevant again: say everything.

Stand on your platforms and in your pulpits and specifically name the bigotry, precisely call out the politics, unequivocally condemn the people and the policies and the movements that sicken you. Jesus did.

Stop couching your words and softening your delivery and start speaking with clarity about what matters to you. That’s what those who are leaving want most.

It may be too late to stop the mass exodus at this point—but saying everything will at least help you keep your soul as you fade away.

At least you’ll know you stood for something.

We hear so much in the news about loudmouths that scream bigotry, intolerance, and racism and claim they represent Christianity.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Here is a good example of how true Christianity is.  Note that there is no press release or nationwide media coverage of things like this, which is one reason why people get such a bad view of religion.
&gt;Dear Church Family,
 
&gt;Several months ago, a certain unnamed pastor here in the city spoke out
&gt;publicly in a derogatory fashion about the Islam faith and its adherents.  As
&gt;the Pastor of Dallas' oldest deeded and dedicated Christian church, I took
&gt;the opportunity to call the Imam at Dallas' oldest mosque to apologize and
&gt;express that not all Christians hold the opinion of that pastor and promised
&gt;to work with him toward understanding and peace.
&gt; 
&gt;Last night Suzanne and I were invited by Imam Khalid Shaheed and his wife
&gt;Bettie to attend an interfaith Ramadan Iftar banquet at the mosque in Richardson.
&gt;It was a wonderful experience!  What struck me the most was that we were
&gt;Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu Americans all sitting down at the
&gt;tables together, breaking bread together in peace and respect.  It truly felt
&gt;as though we were one nation under God.
&gt; 
&gt;The United Methodist Church was very well represented by clergy and lay
&gt;persons from various churches around the metroplex.  It was a real honor
&gt;to sit at a table with the Imam and his wife, the executive Director of Jewish
&gt;Community Relations and a representative of the Roman Catholic diocese.
&gt;Suzanne and I were very proud to represent Cochran Chapel and we look
&gt;forward to continued good relations with the Imam and his wife.
&gt; 
&gt;Jesus has certainly set the example for us as Christians willing to sit at
&gt;table and break bread together in unity and peace.  Last night for two hours,
&gt;persons of many different faith expressions did just that, broke bread together
&gt;in unity and peace and respect.  And, I believe, God was pleased indeed.
&gt; 
&gt;Peace and grace to you,
&gt;Pastor Joe

I don't like getting handed pamphlets or preached to either, but I always feel like the person is trying to help me, and is just misguided.  I do not understand why someone would hate the person or get nasty over it just because you believe something different.  I guess religious intolerance is just as popular in r/atheism.

religion,Being religious does not automatically mean you're good,I believe that being religious and being good are two mutually exclusive concepts.

religion,The Christian heaven would be a sad place knowing for eternity that there’s other people being tortured next door.,"How can you enjoy paradise when there’s millions of people being tortured next door? Can you really turn a blind eye for eternity? Wouldn’t the inhabitants of heaven be upset the whole time, or at least wistfully distracted from whatever pleasure heaven has to offer? Wouldn’t they feel bad about enjoying anything there?

If you can forget about everyone on fire downstairs and it doesn’t give you serious issues that people you met when you were alive are on fire now, but you can just be deliriously happy enjoying all the pleasures of heaven, maybe you don’t deserve heaven.

If I had a party at my place but next door was on fire and there’s a whole lot of people trapped in the building, that would spoil the mood of the party. Even if it’s impossible to rescue anyone, and there’s nothing I can do... well they’re still on fire. What do I do, close the curtains and turn the music up?

I mean if it’s really true, if people really are tortured for eternity, shouldn’t Christians be like PTSD freaking out about everyone? When I was younger my hands used to shake when I was trying to preach the gospel and I lost a lot of friends because people thought I was way too intense and scary. I’m not like that now, these days my girlfriend is Buddhist and I haven’t been to church in years. But if Christianity really is true, maybe I’m wrong to be calm and relaxed. Maybe my hands should be shaking and I should be mentally breaking down. Because the lake of fire is a really intense concept, and if it’s a reality, it’s enough to give anyone serious issues. Just knowing about its existence would make heaven a lot less heavenly.",1585384164.0
religion,My Rabbi just passed.,"This was very sudden and I just learned about it.  He officiated at my brothers and my Bar Mitzvahs.  My Grandfather's memorial service, my Parent's wedding.  To be honest I was never close with the man, he was just there.  He was even a chaplain for my local PD. I was friends with his stepson and got a sense that he was a decent man.  Not perfect but good.  My father and he would usually get into heated arguments about life.  One story goes that when I was just a tyke, not even a year old, my parent's brought me to shul on shabbat and I started fussing during the service.  My father picked me up and was on his way out the door when the Rabbi angrily said from the bimah, ""Would someone please shut that kid up!?""  Again, not perfect but he was there.  We knew and he knew that if any member of our community needed him, he was there, no questions asked.  I'm just kind of in shock and I don't know if this is the right place to put this but I felt like saying something.  It's just hard to think that he won't be around anymore.

religion,Why is Homosexuality considered bad,"Hi r/religion, i posted this on r/islam bit decided to post it here too to see what others have to say i had this question for a while now and the more i think of it the less it makes sense, please give me objective truths and not biased homophobic anwsers, here are my arguments :


1-Things that are haram are usually things that are done by choice and that have bad consequences for the people involved here are some examples:

*Murder : Is bad because you are taking someones life (And is an action you have the choice to do)

*Stealing : is bad because you are taking someone's rightful property (Also a choice)

*Rape : Leaves victims with mental scaring and issues (Also a Choice)

*Incest : You are making babies that are nore likely to be born with disabilities

*Alcohol : is bad because it ruins your brain (Choice)

  so i don't see why homosexual thoughts and actions are considered among these since it doesn't leave Victims and is not generally a choice you have (since believe me i would have loved to choose to be straight if it meant less trouble but unfortunately homosexual people can't choose that)

2- Isn't islam supposed to be the religion of a acceptance of all despite their differences ?
why is it not when it comes to homosexuality

3-The Argument of ""God created ADAM and EVE"" implies that if anyone has autism then he isn't valid because ""Adam and Eve"" didn't, if someone is a different skin color to Adam and Eve does that mean they aren't accepted. people are different and don't fall into a singular box to tick.

4-If Sodomy is the reason you are condemning homosexual relationships, then does that mean Lesbian relationships are allowed ? i mean there is no Sodomy happening

5-""Homosexuals can't reproduce"", so can't infertile women so why are they allowed to get married and have sex, i mean they also can't reproduce

6-There is a lot of talk about ""Lut's people"" but Lut's people generally horrible people who were greedy and stingy and commited rape and incest, but also in the story of Lut when they try to rape Lut's angel visitors both men AND WOMEN were there

7- Isn't punishing homosexuality leading to more suicides which are Haram because god wants to preserve life and insits on staying healthy mentally and physically and loves all his creations equally

Again Please anwser these objectively and unbiasedly, this issue has pestered me for quite a while now.

religion,"She wants to completely immerse our child with her faith, I prefer to let the kid decide.","Hello all, thank you taking time to read this. 

I am not a religious person, I won't try to hide that fact. I grew up in a Baptist family but I never really bought into the group. 
My girlfriend is Catholic and she is fairly devout. She is laid back and doesn't try to push her beliefs on me and I don't try to take her faith away from her. We respect each other views and we don't argue over religion. 

But we had a kid recently and now the topic of religion is coming up more frequently and in more engaged discussion. She, and her family, have decided our kid will be raised catholic and he will follow its traditions. My perspective and my opinion have not been taken into account. 
As result we have been fighting and arguing about religion and how it will influence our kid's life. 

I would prefer that we wait until he is older and can contemplate religion in his own terms and decide for himself what he thinks about the whole thing. I am not against religion at all, and I am not here to debate religious theory, I simply think it is the best compromise to wait until he is older. 

She says that she will still have him baptized and take him to his first communion and that since I am not religious and since I am not catholic then I don't really have a leg to stand on in the matter and she doesn't think its a good idea to try to introduce other religions when he is older because that would be ""dissuading him from catholicism and manipulation of his innocent mind"". Which I find ironic as she is indoctrinating him without his consent. 

He is my son too and I have a say in the matter, which is now our biggest fight.

I think this that regardless of my religious stand point I should have a say in how we introduce religion into his life. I would like to know what some of your opinions are. Because as of now we are only fighting and not seeing eye to eye and I think there should be a fair compromise here.",1589580585.0

I am also confused how she doesn’t know the term. So I say...

“It’s a belief people have, like how you believe in Christianity, which means you believe in Jesus Christ. Like how the Islam religion believes in a god called Allah”

She just looks at me very concerned. And angrily says...

“There’s only one God and everyone knows that. You are the first person to tell me this non sense Islam thing that doesn’t exist”

It finally hits me. She might not  know of other religions besides Christianity. 

So I quickly try to decide If I’m right...

“Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism? Those are all religions people practice like you practice Christianity” 

Stop saying lies I don’t know what those are.

I’m just baffled and walk away.

So either she has been living under a rock all her life on religion. Or she refuses to acknowledge any other religions as being real.

Regardless it’s pretty bad. 

We live in the U.S.A so I don’t know how she doesn’t know of other religions with this melting pot of a country.

This isn’t the first time she claims to not know something. A while back I found out she never knew about the Holocaust of World War 2. She didn’t even know who Hitler was. And she just looked shocked when I showed her pictures of the victims.

religion,Prayer is a good thing,"I am an atheist for all intents and purposes, but I strongly advocate the activities associated with prayer.

Prayer is a healthy hobby. It helps to orally and audibly establish thoughts for oneself to internalize. some people are audible learners and require literal hearing in order to digest said information. You can just pretend that someone is listening and it helps to organize your thoughts. To be criticized for prayer is to dismiss this powerful tool. To have to do all the math in your head of how life works and where your place is in it is difficult. Hearing a problem explained out loud can do a lot to increase understanding. Prayer journaling I think would be even better. It requires oneself to slow down and stay focused on what you wrote.

Pray to Shenron for all I care. I can recommend that you pretend you're talking to Socrates and you try to imagine what he would say.

Should one be ashamed for speaking aloud to an image of what they feel is a perfect being sometimes maybe? maybe God isn't perfect to everyone but it's someone to talk to.

Some atheist don't like religion and religious people because they see them as an oppression , some religious people have problems with atheist because they feel their religion is not respected.  
But this is a statement we can all agree I think. Whatever we believe in , if we are atheist , christian, jewish, pagan , etc... Evry good religion and philosophy teach us to live our lives as good people.  


I don't really follow to the letter this quote because I'm very devout and take a lot of time worshipping, I do it because the connection it gives me give me strengh and support, beauty in the heart and will to change my life to be a better persson. But That's for me. And I truly believe that , whatever god we believe in, we achieve more for the divine scheme by being a good person.

religion,Why are Hindus in India becoming anti Muslim?,"Hinduism is one of most flexible and tolerant religion, everything is flexible, there is no book which decides everything, there is no authority who dictate anything, you want to be openly atheist - it's your life, you want to mock my tradition - I will buy tickets to your show, you want to paint my gods and goddesses in nude - not cool but we won't loose our shit over it. So there must be something which is making us move away from our core principles of tolerance and inclusivity, we can't put in under ""just a bunch of lunatics"" and move ahead. Because it is not some bunch of lunatics which are dictating these changes, these are more of civilization changes. But why?

1. Past - Hindus were ruled by islamic invaders for centuries, and it was not a benovolent rule, countless atrocities were committed. Hinduism still embraced them but their was no acceptance of atrocities from the other side. I am not talking about restitution, just pure and simple acceptance that something bad happened. Many Muslims still revere muslim rulers of the past, naming their kids, schools, colleges and what not after them. Would a German living with Jews name their child ""Hitler""? Countless temples were destroyed and mosques rebuilt on top of their ruins but Muslims even today are not willing to cede an inch of land for rebuilding even one of those temples.

2. Present - India was divided on religious lines but a large number of Muslims stayed back in India. For most of the Indians partition was nightmare that was forgotten but for Hindus who could not come to India this nightmare continues. Hindus are close to extinction in Pakistan. This serves as a glimpse of what Muslims might do when in majority. In India Muslims are the biggest film stars, have captained national cricket team, have been president and what not. Do not see non Muslims enjoying such freedom in Muslim majority countries.

3. Religion first - Muslims have shown to put their religion first and country second on numerous occasions. They do not sing ""vande mataram"" (India's national song, which translates to ""I bow to my mother land"") because in Islam there is only one God and bowing to someone else is like undermining him. Another example of religion first is violent protest by Muslims in india when someone in France drew a cartoon which they found offensive. Never saw a single Muslim which would support those cartoonists in the name of freedom of expression. But ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri pandits (hindus) by Muslim terrorists did not saw any protest by Indian muslims. These pandits were their next door neighbors. Some of the well educated Muslims pray five times a day, no matter where they are.   This continuous display of religiosity creates a feeling of alarm for others. The reasoning goes like if the most educated are so religious what will be status of less educated lot. And a religious person can quickly turn into a fundamentalist.

4. Demographic changes - Muslim population in India has grown faster than Hindu population. Every hindu couple in my knowledge has two or lesser kids where as every muslim couple i know has three or more. This has nothing to do education and financial status because every muslim i know is from educated and rich families. Any talk of population control elicits only one response ""our religion does not allow birth control"". This mentality has two pronged effect - one, India is already a over populated country and opposing birth control is atleast criminal behaviour if not treason. Second, if this continues we would be living in Muslim majority country and track record of such countries in treating their minorities is pathetic to say the least.

5. Tired - Hindus are tired of being sole flag bearer of inclusiveness, tolerance and peace. In India hindu tradition and customs are mercilessly attacked and mocked but other religions are not to be touched.

religion,"Pope Francis has just released an encyclical called Fratelli Tutti. It has some interesting insights when it comes to social justice, solidarity and co-existence.","The Pope released his 3rd encyclical in his Papacy today. And speaking both from the perspective of someone influenced by Catholic Social Teaching as well as Liberation theology he gave some interesting insights into his views on current events today and the Christian approach to them. These are example: 

""The marketplace, by itself, cannot resolve every problem, however much we are asked to believe this dogma of neoliberal faith. Whatever the challenge, this impoverished and repetitive school of thought always offers the same recipes. Neoliberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to the magic theories of “spillover” or “trickle” – without using the name – as the only solution to societal problems. There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged “spillover” does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society. It is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at “promoting an economy that favours productive diversity and business creativity”(Paragraph 168) 

""A journey of peace is possible between religions. Its point of departure must be God’s way of seeing things. “God does not see with his eyes, God sees with his heart. And God’s love is the same for everyone, regardless of religion. Even if they are atheists, his love is the same. When the last day comes, and there is sufficient light to see things as they really are, we are going to find ourselves quite surprised”.(Paragraph 281) 

""One detail about the passers-by does(the Parable of the Good Samaritan) stand out: they were religious, devoted to the worship of God: a priest and a Levite. This detail should not be overlooked. It shows that belief in God and the worship of God are not enough to ensure that we are actually living in a way pleasing to God. A believer may be untrue to everything that his faith demands of him, and yet think he is close to God and better than others. The guarantee of an authentic openness to God, on the other hand, is a way of practising the faith that helps open our hearts to our brothers and sisters. Saint John Chrysostom expressed this pointedly when he challenged his Christian hearers: “Do you wish to honour the body of the Saviour? Do not despise it when it is naked. Do not honour it in church with silk vestments while outside it is naked and numb with cold”. Paradoxically, those who claim to be unbelievers can sometimes put God’s will into practice better than believers.""(Paragraph 74) 

""I sometimes wonder why..... it took so long for the Church unequivocally to condemn slavery and various forms of violence. Today, with our developed spirituality and theology, we have no excuses. Still, there are those who appear to feel encouraged or at least permitted by their faith to support varieties of narrow and violent nationalism, xenophobia and contempt, and even the mistreatment of those who are different. Faith, and the humanism it inspires, must maintain a critical sense in the face of these tendencies, and prompt an immediate response whenever they rear their head. For this reason, it is important that catechesis and preaching speak more directly and clearly about the social meaning of existence, the fraternal dimension of spirituality, our conviction of the inalienable dignity of each person, and our reasons for loving and accepting all our brothers and sisters.""(Paragraph 86) 

""Every war leaves our world worse than it was before. War is a failure of politics and of humanity, a shameful capitulation, a stinging defeat before the forces of evil. Let us not remain mired in theoretical discussions, but touch the wounded flesh of the victims. Let us look once more at all those civilians whose killing was considered “collateral damage”. Let us ask the victims themselves. Let us think of the refugees and displaced, those who suffered the effects of atomic radiation or chemical attacks, the mothers who lost their children, and the boys and girls maimed or deprived of their childhood. Let us hear the true stories of these victims of violence, look at reality through their eyes, and listen with an open heart to the stories they tell. In this way, we will be able to grasp the abyss of evil at the heart of war. Nor will it trouble us to be deemed naive for choosing peace.""(Paragraph 261)

Salutations, my fellow redditor!

I write this letter to you with good will and in the hope next year we improve our relations. Like it or not, we are going to stumble upon the others' postings and stoke the passion that fuels the internet. Before we jump back into our trenches, I've got some goals for myself I'd like to share with you.

**I respect your passion.** We're going to butt heads and I'm ok with you getting angry with me. Heck, you can even pray for me or at me. I don't mind.

**I will give you the benefit of the doubt.** If you can give me convincing arguments about your position, I'll respect them. I am, however, the judge of what convinces me, what changes my point of view, and I'll explain my reasons.

**I will try my best to be civil.** We've been on the internet long enough to know that anonymity creates brave cowards. I'm not going to deny I'm going to get pissed from time to time. If I cross the line, I ask you point it out that I'm being a jerk.

**I will do my best to use facts.** In our passion to prove each other wrong, we're going to have to agree on something. While you and I may widely diverge on origins (the ""why"" something happened), we should be able to respect a wide range of facts and the basis on which those facts are derived. I will do my best to link to sites explaining those facts.

And finally,

**I respect your right to practice your religion.** The separation of church and state means a lot to me, and as long as you and every other person can practice as they freely and choose without coercion, I'm ok with it. And while I may not like your religion or your religious nature, I can agree you have a right to it and I can support your right to it.

Thanks for reading, happy New Years, and may your religion bring you enlightenment, peace and joy throughout the year!

And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

Campbell also quoted Freud in ""The Hero With A Thousand Faces""

&gt;""""The truths contained in religious doctrines are after all so distorted and systematically disguised that the mass of humanity cannot recognize them as true. The case is similar to what happens when we tell a child that new-born babies are brought by the stork. Here, too, we are telling the truth in symbolic clothing, for we know what the large bird signifies. But the child does not know it. He hears only the distorted part of what we say, and feels that he has been deceived; and we know how often his distrust of the grown-ups and his refractoriness actually take their start from this impression."" - Sigmund Freud

\- They missed their children's youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of this regret, but as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners.

religion,"""Please Don't be Muslim"" A Muslim's sentiment in the wake of tragedies in the West","When tragedies occur in America, many of our first thoughts are, ""please don't be Muslim"". This reaction often draws criticism from the overly zealous Politically-Correct loving fanatics who can't sympathize with the sentiment. They will say things like, ""its about the victims right now, don't you have sympathy instead of being selfish...""

Here is where the phrase ""please don't be Muslim"" is lost upon many. The tragedy (Newtown, Aurora theatre, Boston Marathon) already occurred and the innocent lives have been lost and nothing we can do can bring them back and its heart breaking. The ""please don't be Muslim"" phrase already includes these presumptions. The phrase ""please don't be Muslim"" is a prayer/hope that the killers/perpetrators not be Muslim so that millions of Muslims in the West not be harassed, detained, assaulted etc. and innocent children and civilians in (Insert possible Middle Eastern country) not have their lives turned upside down and/or be killed as a reaction to the individual terrorist's atrocity. 

These are not far-fetched delusions but experiential knowledge of the Muslim Ummah over the last 12 years. No one is going to hold candle-light vigils for the drone-killed innocent children and civilians in whatever country the hypothetical terrorist might be from, nor is anyone going to be affected as countless Muslims in the West feel their lives and identity under a microscope. So please save your Politically-Correct BS and let me have the under my breath prayer/hope of ""please don't be Muslim"". 

May God grant patience to the families of the victims and grant the victims a speedy recovery. May God also prevent any fitna/trials to come upon the Ummah through this tragic event.",1366080956.0

religion,Racism and Islamaphobia in France is rampant...,"Recently French President Emanuel Macron said that “Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world today”. According to the French Commission of Human Rights, 34% of the French population view Islam in a negative light, and 50% of them consider it a menace against national identity. In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in 2015 in response to their satirical racist/ islamaphobic portrayal of the prophet Mohammed, there has since been many attacks from Islamic extremists throughout France. 

In 2017 President macron declares that French colonisation of Algeria over 132 years was a “act of barbarianism” and a “crime against humanity”. Obviously the right wing groups denounced this statement and claimed that Macron “hated our (France) country”, and “Is there anything worse when you want to become president than going abroad to accuse the country you want to lead of crimes against humanity?” Despite Macrons statements in 2017 I still believe there is an inherent hatred towards arabs and Muslims. 

I believe that France do not respectfully recognise the destruction of their colonial past, their blatant orientalism during the Napoleonic period is looked past, and their supremacist views of French nationalism has made them blind to their treatment and their generally negative view against Muslims.

religion,Manicheanism.One of the world religions of the past that went extinct.,"Manicheanism is a extinct faith which once had more followers than Zoroastrianism and Judaism combined.It is a syncretic faith founded by Mani,a Jew who lived in the 3rd century Ctesiphon.He traveled far and wide and created a new religion.His faith is a mixture of Zoroastrianism,Gnosticism and Buddhism.His worldview is that good and evil fought over in an eternal battle,similar to Zoroastrianism.However there is a lot of interesting beliefs in this extinct faith as an example,cooking is a sin.According to Manichean lore,Zoroaster brought this faith to Persia,Buddha brought this faith to India,Jesus brought this faith to West and Mani brought this faith to Babylon.Its Holy books survive only in fragments and quotations by Anti Manichean authors like Augustine of Hippo(ex Manichean himself) as well as recent finds in places like Turfan since their faith is persecuted in Tang China,Sassaniad Persia,Christendom,and later the Abbasid Middle East,it survived in Central Asia until the Mongol Invasion and the arrival of Islam.Some of the Holy Books are actually pretty interesting,one of them is a picture book with several drawings(the fragments that survived) called the Arzhang and they have their own liturgical script.Their are credited with the Gospel of Thomas and other Thomas related stuff.Their other holy books include Gospel of Mani,Book of Giants and so on.Their organization is pretty interesting themselves,as an example they have elects and hearers,Elects pray to cleanse the sins of the Hearer while the Hearers cook food for them which is a sin in that faith.Source:- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism)

religion,Middle Eastern society going back to pre-Islamic religions,"Hello everyone. I have noticed that in the past decade a lot of people started following their traditional religions. For example, in Latin America (where I’m from) people are starting to abandon Catholicism and follow pre-Colombian religions and African religions (in the case of Afro latinos). I have also noticed that white people are also starting to practice folk European religions.

I am wondering if middle eastern people will do the same. From what I’ve seen, during this folk-centric movement, Muslims seem to attach themselves more to Islam rather than pre-Islamic religions. Especially in the US, Muslims are becoming liberal but still advocating their religion. Like in the Ramy tv show, where he is trying to be a good, liberal Muslim

Still, I am wondering if middle eastern Muslims will one day in the future follow this trend. Abrahamic religions are heavily based on traditional middle eastern religions, except they follow prophets. Not that it really matters, I just think it’s a cool thing to think about",1600286431.0

Some cultures in the world are intertwined with religion as the West once was so if we want to have understanding between cultures, let's not think from the confrontational viewpoint that ""religion is outdated"".

religion,"If you're interested in reading about Christianity, please don't just look at the American/Westernized version of it.","I'm a Christian.  No surprise - but I'll mention that as a disclaimer now to make my position known, as well as to give an honest warning for any biases.  (You could argue that I'm biased just for writing about Christianity specifically - and that's fair! - but I chose this because 1. it's personally important to me and 2. it is an *overwhelmingly* major religion in the States, so I think it to be most relevant.)  That being said, the point of this post isn't to proselytize.   This is about studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from a slew of denominations, Christianity wasn't manufactured on American soil.  The Bible wasn't written in English by one English-speaking dude.  The early Christians weren't Bible-thumping, gun-toting, red-blooded people from the Bible belt - they were from the opposite side of the world, in an entirely different culture, in an entirely different time, speaking entirely different languages.  The Bible isn't a single book written from start to end in one sitting, but instead a composite of many different books, letters, and poetry by various authors, across various settings, in different languages - and sometimes, with different purposes.  (The Bible is considered unitary in that it's thought to be inspired by God, but that's another conversation. )

&amp;#x200B;

It's easy to become distracted by the hyper-commercialized, somewhat nationalistic Christianity that most of us have encountered.  When you think of the name 'Jesus', you might recall about the cross-wearing teacher you had in middle school, or the well-meaning but strict family you grew up in.   The word 'Christian' probably conjures images of megachurches, suspiciously polite youth pastors, and late night Peter Popoff infomercials.  Or maybe your experiences were more pleasant - maybe you're instead remembering sweet friends and family members who truly embodied the love that their faith seemed to be about.  And that's fine.  But when we stay in these associations, we can fail to acknowledge the rich history and cultural implications that surround this faith.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is bad for a few reasons.  For one, it is difficult to legitimately study or investigate a religion if it's origins/contexts aren't also brought into the picture.   Without prior knowledge or priming, one is prone to superimpose their cultural leanings on a piece of literature and then fail to truly grasp the intentions of the author.  Additionally, it can lead to some historic flippancy.  For example, whether or not the statement is true, describing the Bible as a work of fiction (as a result of personal experiences) can lead to an underestimation of how significantly this collection of works shaped the lives of previous civilizations (and the intelligence of said civilizations).  I don't necessarily mean that in the sense of not believing the Bible is true - I mean that the danger lies in equating it to something like Harry Potter or a romance novel: in other words, deeming it insignificant.  There is also the danger of cultural bias - we tend to retroactively assign our perceptions of modern Christians to its earliest adherents.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I think this is an issue because it leads to a gross attribution of origin.  As someone who descended from African slaves, I've heard family members describe Christianity the 'White man's religion'.  Though I understand their perspective, the statement also makes me cringe - Christianity did not start with slave traders nor Americans.  On the flip side, I have also watched many peers aggressively laud Christianity as 'America's religion' - a perspective that, in its worst form, can lead to pervasive hatred for anything and anyone foreign.  The truth is, Christianity didn't start with early Americans.  Nor did it start with pilgrims, nor the forefathers (who were actually deist, if I remember correctly).   Statements like these rob and dismiss the history of the cultural groups from which the faith first arose.

&amp;#x200B;

As you read about Christianity, please don't just think about your vaguely racist, verse spewing neighbor, nor that Facebook friend who must follow every mention of 'God' with 'America'.   Don't just think about the Pledge of Allegiance.  For the sake of historical accuracy, please also consider the contexts of the scriptures and the people who first encountered them.

EDIT: wow. I love the points being made in this thread. But I also gotta elaborate. This is part of one of my replies.

Both of the religions think they're right and want to save the people on the other side, but let's be honest, no christian dude is gonna walk into a mosque, say ""please become christian"", and convert people. It also won't work the other way around. Nobody's going to change by being argued, hated, or discriminated by people of a different religion. So at this point we gotta let them be. Let's stop calling Islam a religion of war and let's just let them worship God their way. It might be the wrong way according to us, but trying to disprove their religion will not help anyone.

religion,Isn't the concept of religion and science being at odds pretty much a myth?,"The conflict thesis, the idea that religion and science have been at war for centuries is an idea that was developed by 19th century writers William Draper and Andrew Dickson White. That idea has trickled down to popular culture. However even though it's a popular idea, historians and philosophers of science have pretty much rejected it since the 1960s. Because it's based on a pretty shoddy understanding of history and religious faith. 

When you actually take a proper look at history, far from religion inhibiting science, in many cases religious belief actually spurred the sciences on. Take astronomy. That was developed by the Babylonians. Why? Because they saw astronomy as a useful tool to formulate their calendar for their religious festivals. When you study Islamic history, the Golden Age of Islam helped spur on major developments in many areas, particularly in places like chemistry, algebra, medicine, etc. Finally when you take a look at Church history you see that Church people were deeply involved in the sciences. Copernicus, a priest, initiated the scientific revolution. And he did so at the urging of the Cardinals of Rome who heard lectures on his ideas and were impressed. Hence why he published his book as a dedicated to Pope Paul III in 1543. Mendel, a monk, developed our modern concept of genetics. Fr George Lemaitre, another priest, was instrumental in formulating the Big Bang theory. In fact, he initially called it his theory of a ""cosmic egg"". It only got the term ""big bang"" because of a joke the Pope told when hearing of the theory. 

What's also important to note is that for many of these people, they weren't just people who ""happen to be religious"" doing science"". Their religion inspired and motivated them to do science. In the Christian context one of the central ideas in thought and philosophy was the concept of the ""logos""(divine word or reason). It's through this divine reason that God created the world in an ordered, structured and rational pattern from a Christian perspective. And that divine reason is also at the heart of God's being. That notion is important because when you read people like Pascal, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, the founding fathers of the modern scientific method, they saw science as a way to study the mind of God. You especially get this with Newton and Descartes who saw the rational structure of the laws of the universe as a reflection of God's divine reason. So they had theological reasons for helping build the modern scientific method.",1575626473.0

This link provides a good run-down of what exactly that means and why it is important: https://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10agwk/how_to_avoid_arguing_in_bad_faith/ 

Our collective ability to disagree productively is what makes our subreddit welcoming to everyone. This is an interfaith, discussion-based subreddit, which means disagreements are going to be a big part of our discourse here. Our goal is to be able to share our different thoughts and beliefs in a way that promotes discussion and understanding, regardless of any disagreement. Responses that shutdown discussion are therefore antithetical to this goal, and to that end should be avoided.

That means:

* Regardless of our personal opinion with respect to someone’s beliefs or perspectives, we should not resort to name calling or other ad hominem attacks. This is not intelligent discourse and is heavily discouraged, as well as a violation of our rules. Simply put, if someone asks you not to call them something, don’t call them that.

* We should also endeavor to avoid responding emotionally or lashing out. It is completely natural to get upset or angry during an argument or disagreement, but we need to respond with a calm and rational mind. If you need to take a minute before you respond, do so. Reddit is not a live chat environment, there is no pressure to respond right away. 

* If someone has what you perceive to be a bad argument, use reason and helpful language to point out the flaws. Do not denigrate them or their argument as this is unethical and shuts down proper discourse.

* If someone has a bad attitude, remember that people are often going through a lot under what you can see. Be patient with them. That doesn’t mean you have to endure unacceptable behavior, but please don’t respond in kind.

* If someone is continuously behaving poorly, cruelly, or insensitively, report them to the mods and let us deal with it.

* Don't report people because you disagree with them, because they disagree with you, or because they said something critical about your argument or belief system. That is not harassment and any emphasis placed on the “rightness” of their religion over yours is not proselytizing.

We also wish to note that all religious views are allowed and encouraged here, including nontheistic and nonreligious perspectives on religion.",1573656834.0

It's nothing more to me than something Joseph Smith made up. 

They asked me what some of the hurdles were for me. I told them a big one is the Pearl of Great Price. I can't get over how Joseph Smith got the books of Abraham and Moses out of what ended up being a very common excerpt from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Ancient Egyptian written languages are very well known and what Joseph Smith got out of those scrolls is nothing like what is now known to be in them.

religion,Am I in a dreadful cult?,"The act of writing this post itself pains me more than I’d admit to anyone, but I cannot simply sit in silence while immense anxiety cripples me.

I was born into a religious family. By religious I mean fundamental, takes the words of the bible literally, can’t marry outside the church, and God is watching and will punish your evils, you are separated from the rest of the world kind. And I was born as son of a pastor within this church.

I have grown up in the church for as long I can remember. In fact, my mother and father were “introduced” within the church, and were given three months to get to know each other before getting married and making me. After that, my father became a pastor and has been for years, which meant that I was taken along with him on missions.

Well, I have been and continue to be my father’s translator ever since I was twelve, and the religious dogma of the church has colored my views on life, values, ethics, and even love.

I grew up continuously reaffirming my heart whenever I had doubts about the church and its doctrine, as this itself was seen as something taboo, but a certain moment made me snap completely. It was a when a pastor my father had brought over as a guest to speak in a seminar decided to start poking me under the podium, nearly pushing me to go faster in the translation. This made me remember all the years when I told my father that I didn’t want to translate, and that it terrified me, and yet he decided to put a twelve year old me on the podium in fear. It reminded me of when my father threatened to beat me when I choked on the podium one Sunday, instilling in me a fear I cannot shake off till this day. His love always felt conditional, chained to whether or not I performed well on the podium, and whether I was well-behaved in the doctrine. 

All of this kept stress accumulated and I ended up constantly having panic attacks, my heart racing like I was being chased by a massive bull. I was in tears when I went into therapy for the first time, as I described how tried and failed at keeping my thoughts of suicide at bay. I desperately wanted a life of happiness, but the demands of the church for me to function as a translator and to stand on a podium each week to relive my childhood traumas made me dread life, which seemed to be without hope. 

My childhood, my love, my joy, my body.  All of it wasn’t mine, and it never was going to be. It is the will of God that I suffer in such a manner, and I was promised glory in heaven as a reward. Standing on the podium against my will made me feel lifeless. A prop in a show, a tool for God. 

I dreaded every week after another on the podium, with the image of the wooden cross giving me an immense pain in my heart. So I begged my father in tears. I told my father about the continued thoughts of suicide, diagnosed depression, and anxious panic attacks. The hyperventilation, all of it. My father’s response was that since it was for God, it didn’t matter whether it was painful, or even against my will. He told me it was God’s will, and I should believe that myself, to learn to rely on God and get over this issue. He continued to elaborate on how God’s saved children could not suffer mental illness, and that it was my weakened faith, or even that I needed to doubt my salvation. It seemed to me that such doubt from the mouth of his own son disgusted him.

I can no longer see my father, or family the same way as before. I continue to stand on that podium each day, feeling the immense pain go through me as a skewer. I learned to become lifeless and thoughtless on the podium, to lessen the pain, while secretly building hatred toward a family and deity I once loved. 

The hard thing is really, I still don’t know whether I’m in a cult or I’m sinning through my doubt. All I know is that I still want to be happy, and that I’d rather not marry within the family and have children in my own predicament. I honestly think my father wants me to become a pastor, and I continue to dream about my parents dying, leaving me with the choice. Help me, please.

This question is only about the West of which most or all are Christian majority countries historically. 

I'm a Pakistani Canadian btw. When I lived in Pakistan for a bit a few years ago, I had a couple Christian friends (yeah they exist there lol) and if they moved to the west I know for a fact people would assume they were devout Muslims. They follow the bible, abstain from forbidden sins strictly and some of them wear a loose scarf on their head. (fyi, there's no dress code for men or women in pakistan, no hijab no burqa) I have friends from South America who also practice Christianity similarly to Pakistani Christians including very few who have mothers that wear a scarf on their heads.

She is incredibly kind, we laugh together often, and she is very beautiful. I would like to be better friends with her, and perhaps date her if she’s open.

She dresses very modestly and wears a headscarf. I’m unsure what her personal beliefs are, from what I’ve read it can vary quite a bit within Islamic faith. 

I am white and was raised Christian. I want to know if this might interfere with us becoming romantically involved, or if it is against religion or culture. I want to be as respectful as possible, and make sure she is comfortable in case I ask to see her one on one.

religion,On being a fake Muslim and staying civil.,"I grew up and live in religious Muslim family, in a Muslim-majority country.

I will only upset them, and would probably be disowned by my family and shunned by most people I know. 

I think there could be a God/a higher power in the universe, but I have a really hard time trying to believe in religion. I can't believe in it because it's man made, but claim to be God teachings. And there are many rules that doesn't make sense to me. 

I think there are many people who are in the same position as me, especially those who currenly live in religious countries. 

Some people might say that I'm a hypocrite because I don't truly believe in Islam, but I don't leave it either. I just don't see what's good in conveying that I'm an agnostic and confronting people who believe in Islam or other religions. 

I really dislike it when religious people condemn the non-believers. I also dislike it when atheists arrogantly mock religious people. Why can't we just agree to disagree, so we can have a nice, friendly afternoon tea with everybody and achieve world peace.

religion,"A lot of interest in Shinto here, so let me clear up some misconceptions","I see a lot of young people interested in the beliefs of Shinto, so let me clear up the most common misconceptions:

1. It's not Shintoism. We don't like that word. Use Shinto or talk about the specific belief under the umbrella. 

2. We're not drug-friendly. If you're looking for a religion that is going to affirm your drug use with cannabis or psychedelics, look elsewhere. We have little teachings on actual drug use, but there's a general view of being noxious to society as bad, and drugs would in my interpretation fall under this category. A lot of people hate the smell of cannabis, and don't want to see/hear people tripping on their psychedelics. Especially in Japan, where drug use is considered exceptionally **low-class**. 

3. We're not exactly liberal. If you're gay or trans you're still welcomed to join, but you're not going to find people willing to openly affirm your sexuality or identity under a theological basis. There's no marriage for gay couples in Shinto, even to my knowledge in the more liberal beliefs under its umbrella. If you're looking for an openly affirming belief, I recommend you keep on moving. 

4. We're difficult to access. Jinja Shinto shrines are only located in Brazil, San Marino, the US, Hawaii (only listed due to geographical distinction) and Taiwan outside of Japan. Any other shrines you hear about are either Buddhist shrines with Shinto syncretism, or they are for specific Shinto beliefs like Konkokyo. The shrines in the US are in California and Washington. 

5. You're going to need to learn Japanese to some degree. No, watching anime or listening to J-Pop isn't sufficient. 

6. We do not care for people who syncretize the religion carelessly. Shinbutsu-shugo is already very controversial to practice in the modern day, so if you think you can just incorporate them under a Hellenized or Wiccanized pantheon that's often considered incredibly disrespectful. 

It should be noted that this is simply my view on things, and there's likely to be some contention on how this is presented. I'm only trying to discourage people who are openly misinformed about the belief.",1579640415.0

religion,Christianity would sound completely crazy if you had never heard about it.,"And I say this as a Christian, but suppose that Christianity was just a new cult that has only a few decades at max and most people hadn't even heard about it and you had to explain it.
Sometimes I imagine this situation and even as a Christian I totally agree it would sound nuts at first if I were unfamiliar and somebody told me.

Basically Christianity says that God became human in the form of a Galilean man called Jesus of Nazareth who was 100% human and 100% God who performed miracles and had to be horribly tortured and crucified in order to atone for humanity's sin. Also one of the holy sacraments is to eat bread and drink wine that represent the body and blood of Jesus and for some denominations it's literal.

I just see it as being extremely ignorant to discredit everything other religions say as it goes against your own faith in certain ways.

I recognize that and live life with that in my mind so with that being said, why should I act like I somehow know more than others when it comes to religion? It’s tough for me. I truly believe in what I have been taught through my Christian faith, it makes me a better person and it makes me happy that this religion is a part of my life, but is it possible that we aren’t right about everything? Maybe these other two religions speak to me in certain respects and regards that Christianity doesn’t, what does that mean? Am I a bad Christian? Am I even considered a Christian to others if I am questioning our faith and suggesting that other religions could be right about certain things and we could be wrong about certain things?

After twelve days on the water, Utnapishtim opened the hatch of his ship to look around and saw the slopes of Mount Nisir, where he rested his ship for seven days. On the seventh day, he sent a dove out to see if the water had receded, and the dove could find nothing but water, so it returned. Then he sent out a swallow, and just as before, it returned, having found nothing. Finally, Utnapishtim sent out a raven, and the raven saw that the waters had receded, so it circled around, but did not return. Utnapishtim then set all the animals free, and made a sacrifice to the gods. The gods came, and because he had preserved the seed of man while remaining loyal and trusting of his gods, Utnapishtim and his wife were given immortality, as well as a place among the heavenly gods.

religion,Shinto and (Japanese) Buddhism: Differences and a History,"A lot of people here don't quite seem to get the wide differences between the two very different beliefs. So I decided to give people a brief history and a comprehensive list of differences:

**History**: 

Shinto is the native religion of Japan, and has a history that stretches into the Jomon period, more than 10,000 years ago. The best estimate for the age of Shinto's roots is about 7,000 years, making it among the oldest world religions widely practiced (if rather regionally). The Jomon period is a period extending for thousands of years in the past until about 1000-500BC. During this period, a people called the Yayoi came from either Southern China or Northern Vietnam into Japan and radically changed the landscape, through clashes and wars with the Jomon. The modern Yamato people of Japan are considered to be a mix of Jomon, Yayoi, and later Chinese immigrants. 

In the 7th Century AD, Buddhism arrived with Chinese contact and missionaries were setup throughout Japan. Shinto and Buddhism remained somewhat independent, but were often practiced in conjunction by commoners. This practice became known as Shinbutsu-Shugo. Various periods of Japan passed, sometimes with either Emperors or Shoguns or Daimyo promoting one religion over the other. At the end of the Edo period was an event in 1868 called the __Shinbutsu Bunri__. This formally separated Shinto and Buddhism, seized shrines from joint Buddhist hands, and rebased and codified Shinto beliefs by relying on research from the Ko-Shinto movements earlier in the century.

Kokka Shinto, or State Shinto, existed from 1868 to 1946 in Japan, a government controlled form of Shinto focusing on nationalistic elements and worship of the House of Yamato at the expense of other beliefs. This was given blame by the Allied forces for Japan's conduct in the Pacific War, and was dismantled. Shinto thus returned to a variety of beliefs, with the largest and most commonly known being Jinja Shinto. 

**Differences**:

The two religions have substantial differences. I will be outlining them one by one.

Objects of Worship: Shinto focuses on deities called Kami. The definition of Kami encompasses gods and spirits, with the appropriate term when translating varying by the prominence and influence of a kami. Weaker/lesser kami are probably better translated as spirits. Japanese Buddhism worships the various Buddhas practiced in the different types of Mahayana Buddhism (Theravada isn't from Japan) as well as beings called Bodhisattvas. 

Houses of Worship: Shinto houses of worship are called Jinja, which are translated into English as Shrine. Buddhist houses are appended with the word -Ji, which roughly means Temple. Thus, Shinto shrines are NEVER referred to as Temples. Shrines are also almost entirely outdoor for worshipers, besides the haiden (indoor hall of worship), whereas Temples have worship halls that feature prominently as well as many more indoor buildings.

Symbols: Shinto has multiple symbols associated with it. Gate-like arches called torii (which are usually, but not always, red), shimenawa ropes, shide rice paper streamers in the shape of lightning bolts. Buddhism on the other hand uses the Svastika, Wheel of Dharma, Lotus flower and sometimes Pali or Sanskrit writing. 

Clergy: Shinto has priests and priestesses, and is not a monastic tradition at all. The term for a male priest is Kannushi, whereas Shinshoku is usually used for women, though Shinshoku can be used for either sex (kannushi is very common though). Buddhist monks in Japan are called Soh or Biku, the latter being a transliteration of ""bhikku"" from Sanskrit. Monastics cannot usually consume alcohol, whereas priests in Shinto are required for ritual, and alcohol is considered holy.

Reincarnation: Shinto has no historical tradition of reincarnation or rebirth. Buddhism on the other hand does prominently feature this.

Morality: Shinto morality is far more vague and interpretive, without major rules or precepts. It is heavily influenced by Japanese culture. On the other hand, Buddhist morality is very clear cut and with dozens upon dozens of rules and parables. 

Afterlife: Shinto has a few strains on this. In lore, the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki mention several underworlds: Yomi-no-kuni, Ne-no-kuni and Tokoyo-no-kuni. Some of these may be the same or analogous. There's also a commonly held belief of apotheosis, where the dead can become Kami. Ancestor worship also plays in. Buddhism has hells, demonic realms for Asura, heavenly realms for deva, and nirvana, which allows a release from samsara. 

Lore and Holy Books: Shinto has the Kojiki, Nihon Shoki which are the oldest chronicles of Shinto lore. They are not ""holy"", but are important to the belief. There's also other historical texts such as the Kujiki, Engishiki etc. Buddhism in Japan uses the Chinese Buddhist canon, where texts are organized into sutra. 

Prayers: Shinto prayers are called Norito, and are written in either vernacular Japanese, or old Japanese. On the other hand, Buddhist sutra are written in Classical Chinese but pronounced using Japanese phonology, similar to how Ecclesiastical Latin is pronounced much like modern Italian. 

**Last Notes**:

Many people still practice Shinto and Buddhism together, but it is not cut and dry to say they are practiced equally. Many Japanese do not enter temples unless it's a funeral service. Shrines on the other hand are a lot more involved. I would also say based on the above differences, most syncretism comes at the expense of Shinto, and I consider that a huge problem personally. It would be the same with those people who claim to be Catholic Buddhists. It's simply not a compatible combination on its own. 

Buddhist influence leaving Shinto has been good, as we've been able to remove some negative influences. Namely, the Blood Bowl Sutra, a text that is of Chinese Buddhist origin, which says that women offend the world with their menses and are sent to hells where they are forced to bathe in their own blood and forced to drink their own menses. This is not theologically supported in Shinto anywhere, yet it is still a part of Japanese Buddhism at least until relatively recently. Women were buried with copies of the sutra to try and save them from the hell. 

The distinction of our religions is important. Not only does Shinto struggle to be taken seriously in many circles but the widespread history of syncretism has weighed down rediscovering our theology and beliefs.",1593147803.0

religion,Would it surprise people that Fundamentalism is a modern movement?,"Fundamentalism in the Christian context is a movement that is only around 150 years old, finding it's beginning in the Princeton school of theology in the Presbyterian Church by figures like Charles Hodge. It then only became an organized movement at around 1910(100 years) with the publication of a series of tracts known as ""The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth"". 

Not only that but fundamentalist doctrines and ways of interpreting the Bible are fairly recent. The hyper stress on Biblical literalism for instance is a modern development. In the Ancient and Medieval world there were recognized to be at least 4 ways of interpreting. Literal, Allegorical, Moral and Anagogical. Literal was just one of 4 ways to read the Bible. The notion then that the only way to read the Bible is literally is a modern development. Even the doctrine of Biblical Inerrancy. That again is a modern development coming out of the Princeton school of theology.

religion,Tawheed Vs Trinity,"Tawheed Vs trinity 

First I would like to start of my saying I’m a Muslim, so if there is anything wrong in my understanding of the concept of trinity, please point it out to me. Nor is this an attack on Christianity but a means to open a discussion and for us to reach an understanding.

The trinity is the belief that there are three distinct beings (the father, the son and the Holy Ghost) and that these are actually all part of one but in three different forms. 

Tawheed is the pure oneness and uniqueness of god, no partners, no sons or daughters, nothing in his creation resembles him and we cannot even comprehend Allah (swt), what Allah (swt) looks like, his state of being or his greatness. Just one god, who created the heavens and the earth. He is independent of his creation and completely unique. His attributes and names are not like those of humans, ie, his anger and mercy and etc.

We believe that in Islam, there is something called the fitra, which is the natural disposition god has created humans with. It’s the natural pattern and innate way god has created them with, that’s why sometimes you see agnostics saying, I believe in one omnipotent supreme being. They are describing the god of Islam. While the trinity cannot be the fitra, because it’s not something that’s innate in human nature to believe and incline towards. 

**So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.**
(30:30)

 the bible says:

So, God created man in his own image, In the Image of God he created him; Male and female he created them. God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.
(Genesis 1: 27, 31)

The Quran says there is none like god in his creation. God is not some man watching over us with a big white beard from the clouds, which many people like to mock religion by saying. 

**Surah Ikhlas**

1. Say: He is Allah, the One and Only;
2. Allah, the Eternal, Absolute;
3. He begetteth not, nor is He begotten;
4. **And there is none like unto Him**

The word assamad in verse two here is difficult to translate. It means absolute existence, which can only be attributed to god. All other existence being temporal or conditional. It also means that god is not dependent on anyone or anything but that all things are dependent on god. 

**Other verses**

“You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [Al-Fatihah 1:5]

“That is Allah, your Lord!. There is no god but He, the Creator of all things. Then worship Him, and He has the power to dispose of all affairs” [Al-An’am 6:102]

**god does not eat nor drink and is self sufficient**

While the trinity would mean that god ate food. The Quran says god does not eat food and that god is self sufficient. Food is only a means created by god to sustain his creation and for us to be dependent on him and grateful to. How could an omnipotent being eat and drink, it would mean god had a dependency while god is independent. 

 The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.
(5:75)

**nor is god created but creates**

And those they invoke other than Allah create nothing, and they [themselves] are created.
(16:20)

**God has not a son nor daughter**

 john 3:16 says

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

While the Quran says god does not beget and is not begotten. And how could god beget or be begotten, because the word implies a child coming about through sexual intercourse. And exalted is god above such a thing. Begetting is an animal act, and makes no sense to attribute it to god, because it’s something god has put in human nature as a way to reproduce. 

The Quran says:

And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.


There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.


He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.


And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.
(19:92-95)

So then one might ask, if Jesus didn’t have a father, then how did he come about?

Indeed, the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him, ""Be,"" and he was.

religion,"As an American, I dont know anything about Islam","Sorry I know there are a lot of ways to interpret that title, I dont mean to suggest anything offensive against Islam *or* Americans, I was mostly wondering if other Americans had similar observations

I think it's a bit weird actually, I'm hoping it's not just me. 

Like a lot of Americans, I enjoy a bit of TV, reading things online, watching documentaries and the like, but otherwise I'm kind of, unlearned? Ignorant? Something like that but preferably less insulting. I dont really follow a religion myself and I've never *really* sought to learn more about any particular religion, but from all the various things I've watched, seen and read I feel like I've absorbed a decent amount of information about a lot of the major religions out there.

I know a lot about christianity and the various sub groups (comparitively, I'm not even close to an expert), I know a decent bit about Buddhism, Judaism, even Hinduism, but I really have to say I dont know s**t about Islam. 

The entire extent of my knowledge on Islam is they've got a book called the Qu'aran (and I'm pretty sure my spelling's not right), they have some kind of special mat or pillow they pray on, they follow the teachings of somebody called the prophet Mohammed, and they dont generally like when people draw him. That's pretty much it. Oh, and I think Ramadan is a thing of some sort.

For a religion with well over a billion worldwide followers, it seems like we don't talk much about Islam in our culture, at least in our media. I mean I know our general philosophies aren't always in agreement, but that's true of a lot of cultures and you still see them on TV at least.

religion,Why do people attack Christians but not Muslims for not supporting lgbtq+ rights or abortion?,"So this might sound a little controversial but I’m just genuinely curious and couldn’t find answers on the internet.

Anyways...I see many people on the internet or in real life attacking Christians because of their views on gay marriage, abortion, transitioning, other religions, etc. 
Although I am not Islamophobe and respect every religion I can’t help but feeling like this is a little biased. Yeah most Christians have conservative beliefs but so do Muslims yet I don’t see many people going against their views and it confuses me because why would people go against Christians for not supporting abortion, for example, but not against Muslims for sharing the same views? 

Islam has super strict rules (even more strict than Christianity) when it comes to not supporting gay marriage or abortion. Does that happen because they don’t want to disrespect Islam? And if that the case why do they not apply the same behavior with Christians?

religion,"""Hippies"" in the 10th century? The Bogomils and their theology","New to the sub here, I don’t know if this type of discussion is of interest to the members, but I think this movement has a different and interesting theology!

I ran into one of the most fascinating religious movements of the middle ages, Bogomilism. This sect, founded by a village priest named Bogomil (beloved of God), was a dualistic interpretation of christianity. The movement began to spread in Bulgaria, around the year 930. In this interpretation the devil was responsible for the creation of the earth, by consequence, our world was inherently wicked. Two currents emerged, one where Satan was a ""god"" opposite to the Christian God, in a Manichaean conception of Christianity, and another, more moderate, where satan did not have a status equal to that of God. For the bogomils the cross was to be rejected, as it was the instrument of the torture of Christ. The virtues of the practitioners were: poverty, humility, penitence and prayer. The Bogomils neither ate meat or drank wine, and were against the institution of marriage. Their communities also had no hierarchy, as the movement criticized the rich and rejected control by the nobility. When opressed they protested by passive resistance, the movement was greatly encouraged by the way that Bulgarian peasants were treated by the Byzantine elite. Their rejection of the orthodox church was justified by the pomp and corruption that marked it in the eyes of the peasants.

The movement grew in the Balkans and several autonomous peasant communities emerged. When the persecution of practitioners increased, the movement migrated north of the Balkans and several missionaries headed for Dalmatia, Italy and France. In France, missionaries would find some success, influencing the creation of the Cathar movement, brutally repressed in the Albigensian crusade. The Cathars, as the bogomils, believed that this world was the domain os Satan, consequently, everything in the material world was profane. Our world had been created by Satan to imprison the immortal souls in matter. In the west the Cathar movement met its demise in the brutal Albigensian crusade, in the east the bogomils survived until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, when most practitioners converted to Islam.

The parallels between bogomilist movements and some modern anarchist ideologies are quite fascinating. The rejection of the material world, the belief that man should not inflict pain on the world (the sin of eating meat). Also, the rejection of institutions such as: social hierarchy, marriage and organized religion shows a striking similarity with the hippy movements of the 60's and 70's. Of course, comparisons like this can be quite anachronistic, but many things in history show us the different reactions of societies when oppressed or ignored. The idea of ​​passive resistance also resembles much of what was preached in certain ideologies in the 20th century. Running into this subject greatly changed my perception of the various ways that religious movements of the Middle Ages manifested themselves.

religion,"Something that isnt talked about nearly enough...the plague of Anti-Theism, and how it actually HURTS Atheists as a whole. Sincerely, a Deist.","Now, I need to preface this by saying two things in particular. Firstly, a Deist (for the unaware) is someone who is basically the religious version of an Agnostic Atheist. While the Agnostic Atheist is open to the possibility, but is waiting for a chance to truly believe, usually via physical evidence, the Deist is one who believes something is DEFINITELY out there, but it could be LITERALLY ANYTHING, from the world religions of today, to something entirely new.

That said, I also want to preface this by saying that I am NOT here to attack Atheists or Atheism, and if anything, I am HONORING them by calling out this bad side of their community, by differentiating the two, which should also help some concerned Theists (those who follow any particular religion or spirituality) understand as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anti Theism...the feeling of which suggests religion is nothing but negative, detrimental to society, a force of evil and the cause of most sufferings, and something to be abolished or ignored outright by society. This may not be the exact definition, but it is a very close approximation. Usually, some definitions try to paint it as ONLY targetting organized religion, so perhaps they dont hate Christianity, they hate the Central Church structure of it. This would be fine, if there werent so many Anti-Theists out there who go BEYOND that.

There is a HUGE difference between this, and simply not believing in any sort of spirituality or higher power (Atheism), and it is THESE people that continue to hold the good Atheists back from full social acceptance, something they still dont entirely get even in the advanced western world. Now, what is the issue exactly? My dear viewer, it is not as many would claim...the issue is not one of the following common excuses.

**""You cant handle when religion is criticized"", ""You cant handle people poking fun at religion"", ""You cant accept religion isnt perfect.""**

Now obviously, this is again, NOT the case at all, and I accept all three of these to a T. However, this is not what my problem is. My problem is mainly that these raging Anti-Theists absolutely DESPISE religion and consider anyone who believes in it to be intellectually inferior or stunted, and even go as far as to call religion a ""detriment to scientific/human progress."". They usually pull on fallacies and stereotypes to try and further their goal of bashing religion, when this simply is NOT the proper way to handle it.

For example, have any Atheist readers out there ever been told that ""Atheism causes immorality and the lack of good values""? Now, this is a stereotype, and you probably heard other fallacy arguments against Atheism as well right? Now, obviously, just because those crazy people SAY that Atheism is amoral and wrong, doesn't mean it is. However, it seems that we give Anti-Theists a pass most of the time when they say similar shit about religion.

These people will crawl out of the wood works JUST to take a stab at religious people even when they say something COMPLETELY casual and innocent, like ""God bless all of you :)"" or something that isnt even that intrusive, ESPECIALLY on a non-religious video.

I could go on and on, but I think I have summarized them pretty well, so lets move onto the social aspect, and why we (especially Atheists) need to start accepting the fact that yes, they have bad people like this too, and its time to start calling them out. The problem I always find is that many big atheist/skeptic channels (not MAJOR CONTROVERSIAL ones, just moderate ones usually, but also them.) will CONSTANTLY tell you about the wrongs and evils of the religious folks in their life, and how atheists are constantly beat down by society, and honestly? Yeah, Atheists are in fact beat down and scrutinized unfairly. However, they always always ALWAYS ignore the possibility that anti-theists are the same sort of irrational and mindless hate mob as many stereotypical christians and other extremist religious folks are.

Not once have I EVER seen one of these people make an entire video dedicated to the subject, and I think I have an idea why. I think its because of fear. Fear of what you may ask? Well, the fear of confirming the biases and foolish beliefs of these extremist and stereotypical religious folks. They make so many videos trying to defend atheism that they simply dont have the time or resources to risk humbling atheism as a whole. They dont know how to admit to atheisms flaws in a way that wont be abused by religious nuts.

Now let me say that I mean NO offense to atheists when I say this, I do NOT intend to demonize you with that former paragraph. However, I know what I saw, and I just wish more atheists talked about these stupid anti theists/internet atheists. In fact, Encyclopedia Dramatica sadly has one of the most accurate (if exaggerated to all HELL) articles detailing this EXACT breed of anti theist, and even URBAN DICTIONARY has a few words to say on it too.

For example they all seem to have the foundation of Gods laws, but have they evolved over-time into other teachings that cause people to sin or not have true faith because of mans interpretation. I haven't read much about these religions which is why I'm asking if it's true. For example, how did Christians end up in wars, such as the crusades, when it's a commandment to not kill?

I lived in the US most of my life so I feel like I’m qualified for this. These countries in the Middle East, are exactly what medieval was, people in power distorting the Bible to achieve their goals of power and wealth. Kings back then would fight each other despite the Bible prohibiting violence, they usually paid the pope or other religious figures a lot of money to give them the blessing to kill fellow Christians. It’s the same thing with Islam. You read the source directly, the Koran, it says a lot of things you wouldn’t expect like “your not allowed to force people to Islam” “you aren’t allowed to repress the rights of women” “you can’t dispel your family members if they leave Islam”. The problem here lies in the leaders of Muslim nations, starting with the Ottoman Empire, who took things out of context to pursue their own nefarious deeds. For example, isis states that all Non-believers must be killed. They point to a verse in the Koran for proof, but that verse is taken out of context. The verses are: “ 1. you are  prohibited to harm innocent non-believers until they have wronged you” “2. And to THOSE non believers, you are allowed to seek retribution with violence if necessary”. An organization like isis will take the second verse (rough translation as I haven’t memorized it) and use it as proof without taking the other parts into context and this distorts western views of Islam (because why would you support a religion which encourages to kill all other non-believers?). A country like Saudi Arabia prevents women from driving or from taking office despite the fact that this isn’t allowed. Back in the days of the prophet, his wife Khadijah was one of the most respected leaders of the community. Saudi Arabia does this to keep power for their leaders, who are all or mostly men, and prevent women from gaining any power in the community through suppression of their rights. And like medieval Europe, they pay off religious leaders to help convince the masses that women don’t deserve these rights, even though the Koran says otherwise and that women in the past were allowed to have power in a Muslim society. And the other issues like beating women and raping women are, again, prohibited by the Koran, but I feel like these issues will happen in a society regardless (America itself has thousands of rape and domestic abuse cases every year) and depends on the individual. When it comes to homosexuality, it is not viewed differently as straight relationships; but in Islam you are not allowed to have sexual relations with anyone unless it is for reproduction with your wife or husband. If anybody, man or woman, commits adultery or fornication, then they are beaten harshly, and if it is repeated they are sent to prison. Although some countries give the death penalty for these actions (can you guess who? Hint it’s Saudi Arabia) even though it shouldn’t be done according to Koran. 


TLDR: lots of misinformation is spread about Islam mainly due to corrupt Muslim leaders and isis (pretty much like medieval Europe). I just hope to educate you on what the source, the Koran, really says about these types of issues.

religion,"I feel a deep connection to Christ, but not mainstream Christianity. What should I do?","Hi all,

So I had what I'm going to refer to as a born again experience a few months ago where I was meditating and suddenly forgave someone who has been a very difficult person in my life. This was a really incredible moment and I felt like I personally experienced the teachings of Christ firsthand for the first time. Since then I have been a little confused about religion, because I'm really uncomfortable with a lot of mainstream Christian beliefs.

I don't believe in lionizing one's salvation and thinking about where you go after you die as the end goal. I don't want to think about whether or not someone will go to hell because I don't believe humans have enough knowledge of God to truly understand what will happen in the afterlife. I understand that Jesus preached salvation but I personally feel like those messages were for Jesus alone to deliver, and that if one wants salvation they can choose to live a Christ-like life and even read the bible if they want. If I were to identify as Christian I would see my responsibility as to just point people towards the teachings of Christ so they can learn from him, not pass judgement on whether or not they will go to hell. I also can't do the whole ""being gay is a sin"" thing because there are many sins, but a lot of Christians conveniently focus on being gay, even though there are many other sins that people commit on a sometimes daily basis without realizing. I personally don't even believe being gay is a sin.

I would love to find a religious study group, but I fear I will never find one that will align with my beliefs perfectly. I have borrowed from many religious traditions over the years and I'm in a support group now that uses buddhist teachings which I really appreciate. I also on some level believe that all these symbols are arbitrary and that using teachings of great figures like Christ or Buddha or even Anton LaVey (the Satanist) are a helpful way to guide someone towards leading a healthy life where they help others make peace with themselves.

I just am really at a loss. I want to keep exploring my spirituality but I don't know where to go. I want to learn more about the teachings of Christ and how to live a Christ-like life so if anyone has resources that would be appreciated.

I’m kind of uneducated, so I am very sorry if I write anything incorrect (please correct me). Only until just now I realized I don’t exactly resonate with Christianity, or at least how my parents follow it. I believe there is a God, there is a heaven, there is a hell. But I believe in purgatory. I don’t like the idea that God can make someone a certain way (lgbt), and send them to burn for all eternity for it. I am spiritual, I like tarot, I believe in having psychic gifts. I remember my Mom saying that this was bad. Saying that people should not be believing they have such gifts. (I am not sure if that is Christian though, it seems a little controversial amongst them) Am I still Christian? I don’t think, because my parents mention “purity” a lot. And to be honest if I do find a religion that resonates, I will be too scared to convert because of the taboo that my church and parents subconsciously put around the act. I just feel like there is a problem with the fact that I feel like I “have” to follow my religion. Or that when talking about my own religious group I feel that I have to say “them”. Can someone please enlighten me? Can I just not have a religion and just straight up follow what I believe in? Does any religion that sounds like I resonate with come to mind?

As I grew I realized that even the closest people in my life were not following those values and principles and as a teenager I started exploring other theories that will justify the meaning of my own existence and my purpose in life .I started learning about  Darwin's theory and as by that time I was living in an atheist country the Islamic values fastly faded and I stopped believing in ALLAH. I started drinking not fasting Ramadan and seeing women. 

However after several years in an uncesored but okay life, Emotionally I always felt and emptiness something that was missing, I had a lot of unanswered questions that ruminates inside me but with no answer to cool them down.

One day as I was taking the train from the city where I used to study to my parents home. I saw a man with a familiar face but I couldnt know where I previously met him. We did not talk but weirdly we were on the same wagon and we both were going to the same city. As we arrived I noticed that the man forgot a book, I took it with the hope to find the guy in the station. I could not find him so I ended up keeping the book. It was a novel by José Rodrigez Dos Santos named God""s formula.  The book had really inspired me as it was revealing the perfection in creation based on Quantum physics and other factors. That was an eye opening reading for me as It proved me that the perfection in the uiverse could not just be hazardous. And that totally mase sense for me. After further readings The idea of creator just got more and more clear and obvious until I totally accepted it.

Few years went by and 1 Year ago I had few bad experiences due to bad choices that led me to a severe depression. I went to the doctor who prescribed for me some medicine but after using them for some times. I realized that that was not what I needed. I had the feeling to just hide my problems and not facing them. 

And came this time where I decided ro read the coran for the first time as an adult. When I read it first it was actually to find reasons to completely take away the idea of islam from my life. But when I read it, it was the revelation.  I got the feeling that all the prejudices I had developped about about Islam had no fundamentals. It found that it was the book of peace and guidance and it was adressed to my inner seld answerinf the most contoversial existential questions I had . 

So, I started praying and finakky started working on the connection between me and the creator of this universe. I started asking him for things and he answered ( ABout this part its not even something that I can write more about but I am happy to experience such thing). I went from miserable to happy, from unwanted to wanted from assuming lige to fully embracing it and admiring its beauty.

From this post I just want to take the opportunity to thank God for blessing me and yaking care of me. I al far from being the the most religious guy. But I am glad to at least know that it works and that it is true.

religion,Would these facts about the Spanish Inquisition surprise you?,"The Spanish Inquisition is known for it's investigation of heretics as well as the persecution of Jews and Muslims. All of which is true. But there is another side to it's record which might be a little surprising. 

(i)The Spanish Inquisition defended the rights of Native Americans

Many of the Grand Inquisitors who took a harsh stance on Muslims, Jews and heretics defended Native Americans. For instance Cardinal Cisneros, who led the Inquisition after Torquemada. He was known for his harsh intolerance to Muslims. Yet when he heard reports of the atrocities committed by the conquistadors in the Caribbean, he sent a team of Dominican Monks to investigate the reports. They were led by Pedro De Cordoba(the first inquisitor of the New World). When the reports were confirmed De Cordoba commissioned a monk named Antonio De Montesinos to preach a famous sermon condemning the crimes of the Conquistadors. This led to the first human rights movement in global history. Later on Cisneros commissioned Bartolome De Las Casas with the title ""protector of the indians"". The result of this was the abolition of encomienda(the system of slavery in the Spanish colonies) and the liberation of hundreds of thousands of indigenous women and children. Another example of this is Juan Zumarraga, Inquisitor of the Mexican Inquisition. He prosecuted heresy, but at the same time consistently defended native americans from spanish colonists, to the point of having some of the conquistadors tried and arrested. 

(ii)The Spanish Inquisition condemned the persecution of women accused of witchcraft

In 1526 the Suprema, the General Council of the Inquisition, held a vote which condemned the persecution of witches, expressing skepticism that witchcraft existed. In 1538 the Suprema issue a notification to it's local tribunals condemning the use of the Malleus Malifecarum, a document that helped fan the flames of the witch craze. In 1614, under the influence of Alonso De Salazar, the Inquisition developed what was called the ""Instructions"" a series of legal procedures that gave legal protection to women accused of witchcraft. As a result the witchcraze in Spain did not reach the proportions it did in countries like England or the Holy Roman Empire. 

(iii)The Spanish Inquisition prosecuted sexual abuse(including clerical sexual abuse).  

""Sodomy"" was under the portfolio of crimes prosecuted by the Inquisition. When one looks at the record though what was classified as ""Sodomy"" wasn't two consenting adults of the same sex. It was older men having a relationship with children(pedophilia). That was criminalized across society, including among the clergy. So if anyone engaged in pedophilia or if any cleric abused a child the penalty was the same as the one for heresy. Death by burning. The Inquisition even had a statistical break down of the amount of pedophiles and sex offenders they burnt to death based on their profession. 

(iv)The Inquisition dealt with cases involving Transgender people. 

The Inquisition has records involving receiving cases involving Transgender people. Their reaction was very interesting. Because Gender Identity was not a concept that was understood well back then(and it still isn't today) rather than actually try the case, their tribunals would typically review it and then dismiss it out of hand because they didn't know how to proceed.

There are social rules that are pretty consistent across all cultures (such as “killing people for no reason is kind of a dick move.”).

religion,Why is LGBT+ (as far as I know) forbidden in Islam and what’s the justification for it?,"I don’t know 100% what Islam’s stance in LGBT+ is but from the Muslims I know and from what I’ve read and seen, LGBT+ is a sin and forbidden in Islam - whether this is true I would like to know.

I am purely asking because I can’t find answers anywhere else and I want to speak to actual Muslims about this rather than just reading random articles online and forming an inaccurate opinion on Islam.


I’ve seen many Muslims, including ones from younger generations say that LGBT+ is a sin or at the very least forbidden. This has come from people who are seemingly progressive and tolerant. The justification given is that “it isn’t the person that is forbidden it is the sin” essentially that being LGBT+ is separate from the person and the “choice” to live “that lifestyle” is what is forbidden. The thing is, it isn’t a lifestyle or a choice. Being gay (for example) is not a lifestyle the same way having blue eyes isn’t a lifestyle. So how is it forbidden? And what’s the justification for it? 


Additionally, why is being straight completely fine but being anything else is considered a sin specifically? What makes it sinful?


EDIT: Whilst this post does specifically talk about Islam, I am aware that this concept is not specific to Islam and other Abrahamic faiths share these beliefs.

religion,What do Europeans think of religion in America?,"Religiously, I'm aware America is quite different from Europe. Besides the fact that Catholics are considered a minority group here, Christianity seems to play a far bigger role in this country than it does in Europe. It appears in politics far more often, and you see a seemingly endless list of various Christian activist groups. There's also the seemingly eternal debate over evolution and creationism, which much to my confusion doesn't appear to be present in Europe. I read once that when some American Creationists went to Europe, they initially drew interest from Europeans, but the Europeans quickly turned against them as they started to promote right-wing politics.

I wonder what Europeans think when they see all the religious talk going on in the US?

Though honestly, I'm thinking I may need to summarize the history of religion in this country (at least, how its normally taught here). 

Most of the colonists that came to this country belonged to Christian denominations, and came here to escape persecution from the Vatican in Europe at the time. Unsurprisingly, when the country was formed they put in in the constitution itself that everyone could practice any religion they want. Today though, there's a lot of debate as to if they actually meant 'any religion' or 'any denomination of Christianity'. Either way, this country remained strongly Christian for most of its history, with Atheism only starting to spread sometime in the early 20th century. Before this, the country had experienced two 'great revivals', which was essentially an upsurge in obsession over religion. The creationism evolution debate began sometime in the early 20th century, even though evolution had existed since the 1860s if I remember right. Despite the rise in questioning of the bible, America still remained almost exclusively Christian well into the 90s. It was only with the millennial generation that you started to see a major drop in people reporting being Christian. This has created a generation gap within the religious community. People who are middle-aged or older are almost exclusively Christian, while only about a third of young people are. The evolution creationism debate has also managed to continue into the present, even though the government passed a law decades ago requiring it to be taught in all schools. Its rarely adhered to, and nobody's interested in enforcing it. My own biology teacher just gave us a one-word summary of what evolution was, right after explaining that the sole reason she was bringing it up at all was because it was required of her, and she clearly wasn't too happy about that. I think that gives you a taste of religion in the US.

Today, Christianity is also strongly associated with the right wing. The left normally supports religious freedom, while the right has increasingly turned against non-Christian religions (and sometimes Catholics, a legacy of the persecution the first American Christians experienced in Europe).

Christianity has also become increasingly associated with bigotry in the US by the non-Religious. The Gay Rights issue is a prime example of this. Though to be honest, the Christian Right tends to just use their religion to justify their political beliefs, regardless if they're encoded in the Bible or not. For instance, the 19th century it was common for supporters of slavery to claim that the bible supported racism (often by claiming that the unspecified 'mark of Cain' in the bible was black skin, which of course no American bible has ever said). 

Christians today tend to see their religion as declining in the US, and they see that as a terrible thing, especially since America seems to be one of the few heavily Christian nations left in the world. Personally, I think this may be responsible for the increased backlash coming from the American Christian community, but I don't know that for a fact. American Christians in general seem to leaned more and more towards 'fundamentalism' (fanatical Christianity essentially, they claim to be restoring the religion to what it once was, though of course historians strongly dispute such claims) as the decades have gone by. I don't know the reason for this, but it might be because of the popularity of New Atheism in this country. Christians in general receive a lot of flak from Atheists in this country, which I think has fueled a cultural divide along religious lines. Its common for Chritian groups to form 'think tanks', which are isolated groups made up of like-minded individuals to discuss their views. Essentially, its a form of echo chamber that predates the internet. Gives you an idea of how divided Christians are from many others in this country.

So yeah, that's American Christianity in a nut shell. What do Europeans make of all of this?",1584710822.0
religion,An interesting read for those Christians that like to promote Islam as a barbaric and backward religion and Christianity as a peaceful religion.,"“Jenkins is a professor at Penn State University and author of two books dealing with the issue: the recently published Jesus Wars, and Dark Passages , which has not been published but is already drawing controversy.

Much to my surprise, the Islamic scriptures in the Quran were actually far less bloody and less violent than those in the Bible.
Philip Jenkins, author of 'Jesus Wars'
Violence in the Quran, he and others say, is largely a defense against attack.

""By the standards of the time, which is the 7th century A.D., the laws of war that are laid down by the Quran are actually reasonably humane,"" he says. ""Then we turn to the Bible, and we actually find something that is for many people a real surprise. There is a specific kind of warfare laid down in the Bible which we can only call genocide.""

I’m not saying what’s in the bible is wrong because for all I know they may have been prescribed by Allah (swt). But all I’m saying is it’s not fair to push Islam as a barbaric religion, when in reality this concept of war in Islam, is a spiritual act, and in reality, the rules of warfare in Islam are much more humane, then any man made laws about war. Such as not mutilating bodies or striking the face and etc. And the first war prescribed in Islam in the Quran was due to self defence. 

I’m not saying all Christians are like this but this is something I’ve seen Islam stereotyped as by a lot of Christians when in reality it is very far removed from the truth

religion,How do I accept my self if I feel something is not ok with my religious status.,"Hello,

I'm a 25 man who was born and raised in Israel. I still live here.

My father is a Jew and my mother isn't. In our country it means that I'm not a Jewish person.

All my environment is Jewish, my friends, my EX, my colleagues. 

why is it a problem :

1- I can't get married in Israel, I must go to another country, get married and then I get back and get recognized as married couple by law.

2- I can't get  buried in a Jewish cemetery - only in a citizen one (which can mean I won't be next to my wife when the time comes)

I served in the army for 7 years, sacrificing so much for my country and still I am not allowed to get married here by law which is ridiculous for an advanced country like Israel, but that's not the main topic here.

I want to marry a Jewish woman here even tough I ain't one by law so that my kids would be Jewish and will not have to deal with these issues.

But - I find hard times to have peace with my self, I'm afraid no woman would ever want that with me.

I did have a girl friend for the past 2 years + and we broke up for different reasons, I think one of them was also that I'm not Jew and she wanted to have a Jewish religious type of wedding which I couldn't give her.

Converting is too complicated because honestly, I am not a religious type of guy and doing that only to be called Jew isn't right I think, that's not a good reason to convert - I think it's more important to just accept my self as who I am but I find it hard and I have a lot of thought and conflict with my self !",1601302680.0
religion,I believe in God but I don't follow any particular religion. How to educate my children?,"Hi everyone! I live in a catholic contry and I received a Catholic education from school and church but  my family is non-religious. Instead my partner comes from a very Catholic family and still attends church. I'm not atheist or agnostic, I believe in Something but I have my personal idea of God. I don't like the dogmas of traditional religions, I think they limit something indefinite like the concept of God. I love the Christian message of compassion and equality between human beings and I try to follow this values in my life but I don't believe Jesus was son of God, I don't believe in heaven vs hell, I don't believe humans are the centre of God's creation etc. So I can't call myself a Christian. Despite this my children will be baptized and they'll attend catechism (a sort of Sunday school) that the 99% of children attend here in Italy because their dad and culture are catholic and because I guess it's a  starting point to understand the transcendental side of existence. I will teach them to feel the connection with the nature and the marvel in front of the beauty and perfection of the Universe, I will tell them the story of big men as Jesus, st Francis, Budda, I'll explain them that they were more illuminated than common people but that they were still people. Despite this I have more questions thant aswers and what could I say them when they'll ask me what happen after death?  If heaven and hell really exist? If God really listen our prayes? Maybe they'll not ask these particular questions but for sure they'll ask questions. How can I aswer them without confuse them?

I would never judge someone for that as I wouldn't want the same to be done to myself. And if this isn't the right sub to post this please let me know, thanks.

For as long as I can remember I had issues with believing in god. I was a hardcore atheist.  My mom took me to church every Sunday but never pressured me to become religious, my grandmother is the opposite. For some reason, I could not grasp the concept of some man being up in the sky judging me for everything I do. It's like being under a constant microscope and if I screwed up even once I would condemned to eternal hell. I also couldn't stand the amount of bigotry and racism that religious people spewed. If god is supposed to love all his children, why is discrimination and hatred being preached just because it says so in the bible? Hate is justified because god says so? And if you question him you go to hell? Why do some people need a bible to tell them to treat others with kindness and respect? I am also a very science based person. How is there a god when in 5 billion years the earth is going to be swallowed by the sun and humanity will die out long before then? Evolution? If he did kickstart the universe, why did he just leave? These are questions that seem very logical to me but every time I ask someone who is religious they tell me not question God? Why is asking seemingly logical questions seen as a bad thing with the evidence given? 

The thing that really pushed me further away from religion the most was my mom dying 3 years ago. I was only 16 years old. And I was angry. If god is supposed to be helpful, why did he take my mother away when I was still technically a child? Was it my punishment for not believing in him? Praying didn't prevent my mother from dying and it wasn't going to bring her back. There is literally no proven correlation between praying and a good outcome happening. The human brain is complicated and can play tricks on us.

However I've been questioning my stance lately. Maybe it's the pandemic given me more time to dwell on it or maybe it's because I just turned 20. I feel as though I am going between wondering if there is a creator or not. I've been thinking about the universe and how it came to be and my mortality. Maybe it's my brains coping mechanism in dealing with the harsh reality of death but I don't know. I can't tell if I am heading for agnosticism or not. Has anyone else felt this way.",1592627126.0

Anyway, read an article today in the Guardian (can't link to it or post will be deleted apparently, you can easily find by the title of post) and thought I'd share and open for comments as this is a physicist saying this:

&gt;There’s a tendency, certainly among some scientists I know, to judge religion by whether or not it gives us factual information about an objective reality. **That’s not the right yardstick.** 

&gt;There are many others who recognise that the value of religion is found in its capacity to provide a sense of community, to allow us to see our lives within a larger context, to connect us through ritual to our forebears, to alleviate anxiety in the face of mortality, among other thoroughly subjective benefits. 

&gt;When I’m looking to understand myself as a human, and how I fit in to the long chain of human culture that reaches back thousands of years, religion is a deeply valuable part of that story.

Exactly my thoughts. Very refreshing.

I also think this is indicative of a coming shift away from materialism (the failure of what we might call Neo-Atheism in fact, at least a failure to provide any answers to people's questions) and the re-emergence of spiritual/religious thought.

religion,Dealing with death anxiety,"Hi everyone. I lost my dad to stage 4 lung cancer in April. He was my best friend; we were super close and after losing him, I felt like I lost a part of my self. I fell into deep anxiety that resulted in severe OCD and fear of death (I’m seeing a therapist)

My family is Muslim. Both of my parents are amazing and I know I am beyond lucky to be born as their daughters. They have never once forced their religious beliefs onto us and let us find our own path in life. They practiced what they preached; they are the most sincere, gracious, and loving people I know (I know I’m probably biased lol but still) if I have to endure through the same pain and hardships to be born as their daughter again, I would do it in a heartbeat. 


I was never religious before but turned to religion for answer and comfort after my dad passed away. This semester I decided to do some exposure therapy to alleviate my fear of death by taking a course on a psychology class on death and dying. As expected, my anxiety is very high right now. The reason is because it talks about how most people suppress their fear of death and usually either doesn’t  want to talk about it or uses some variation to comfort themselves 

One variation is religion. Religion tends to promise some kind of immortality. And once I processed that, I started to question everything. I started to question if my faith is truly sincere or not. I kept wondering if after we die, what if there’s truly nothing? No God. No after life. No chance to meet my dad again. Honestly that breaks my heart even more. The thought of there being nothing, even if it’s something similar to as before we were born, even if I won’t be aware of these feelings, I truly really hate the thought of there being nothing. Religion does give me hope. And there have been times that my prayers have been answered but in the back of my mind, I think it’s just a coincidence. And many people say that most scientific evidence points to the end of consciousness after the end of brain activity. I keep having nightmares about my dad dying; thinking that he doesn’t exist anymore. I know he’s no longer in pain but God it just hurts so much. I desperately want to believe that there’s something more than just this physical world, I desperately want to believe that one day I can see my dad’s smile again. I’m tearing up while writing this lol it’s still so hard to talk about him.

Anyways, I know this is a common fear and a lot of people think the same. And I know that nobody knows what happens after we die. I don’t want to let go of my faith. It actually has become stronger than before although I still have fear and doubts, it’s getting better. I know many people scoff at the idea of religion but it’s something I’d still like to hold on to. It’s just hard dealing with anxiety about the unknown.",1599645949.0
religion,Can anyone offer a conversation with an confused agnostic?,"Hi r/religion,

Sorry if this post doesn't fit in with the subreddit, I'll be honest that I haven't had long to look through it!

I am a 23 year old woman from the UK and I am questioning my faith (or lack of faith perhaps?) I have no one in my life who is religious and I live in a very rural area and am not sure how to connect with those who are religious around me. I finally realised that I have the power of the internet at my fingertips and as such came to reddit and found this sub.

I have been through a number of experiences now which have made me question my atheism. I see many posts on reddit from Americans (sorry if this comes across as rude) who come to terms with losing faith, but not so many that come to terms with gaining faith. I think it is important to let you know that I have mental health issues and have experienced an episode of psychosis. In my country it seems most people are not religious or do not really practice religion any more. I'm sure this is partially down to my limited world view because I am simply not a part of the ""religious circles"" around me. Either way, now when I think of religion and the role of God\*\* I am left very confused. I do not feel I can freely discuss this because it is easy for those around me to put it down to psychosis or my mental illnesses.

I sometimes feel like there is a presence around me that I cannot fully comprehend. I wonder if this is what religious people feel? If I am honest, I am worried that this is merely me seeking for meaning in a world that seems so meaningless. I worry that I am seeing something that is not there. I naturally have a very critical mind and frequently question and review my beliefs and thoughts. As a part of this I think it would be super helpful to speak with people who are religious and who are open to me asking questions that may be tough. I do not seek to offend or disprove anybodies personal beliefs, I just want to get a better understanding for myself and hopefully of myself.

I wasn't sure whether to include this next bit but I guess I have nothing to lose. I am currently very suicidal and am considering ending my life early. I am fearful of the consequences of this. I have come to think that if there is a divine judgement after death, it may come down to the good that I have contributed to this world vs the bad that I have put into it. If I kill myself I will be adding a lot of sadness and hopelessness to the world and specifically to my loved ones. I wonder if this will mean that I am ultimately a bad person.

I would really appreciate hearing peoples personal stories on their connection with faith and God\*\*. I'm not sure exactly what question's I need to ask or what I am seeking answers to, but since I have no one in real life to really speak with about this I was hoping some of you might be kind enough to offer your thoughts.

\*\* When I say God, I am open to the idea of all Gods. I am not entirely sure how to word this - I apologise. I recognise I have a very small and one sided ""viewing window"" of the world. I went to a Christian primary school from ages 7-11 and as such Christianity is the religion I have learnt most about. When I assess my own views I see ""God"" as an amalgamation of all ""Gods"", whether it be the Christian God or Allah or Buddah. I have not yet found one religion I identify more with than another, but I 100 percent see the value in all the religions I have so far come across. I appreciate all religions because in my personal opinion they all bring something of value.

Thank you for reading and thank you if you take the time to reply. I am very tired this evening and as such may not be online for much longer but I promise you I will read any responses and will continue on this path of religious discovery and self discovery for as long as I can.

Thanks :)

A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Qur'an for a people who know,
As a giver of good tidings and a warner; **but most of them** turn away, so they do not hear.
(41:3-4)

Or do you think that **most of them** hear or reason? They are not except like livestock. Rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way.
(25:44)

And if you obey **most of those upon the earth,** they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.
(6:116)

Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say, [O Muhammad], ""Produce your proof. This [Qur'an] is the message for those with me and the message of those before me."" But **most of them** do not know the truth, so they are turning away.
(21:24)

And even if We had sent down to them the angels [with the message] and the dead spoke to them [of it] and We gathered together every [created] thing in front of them, they would not believe unless Allah should will. **But most of them, [of that], are ignorant.**
(6:111)

And if you asked them, ""Who created the heavens and earth?"" they would surely say, "" Allah."" Say, ""[All] praise is [due] to Allah ""; **but most of them do not know.**
(31:25)

And **most of them** follow not except assumption. Indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.
(10:36)

Indeed in that is a sign, but **most of them** were not to be believers.
(26:8)

**As for the minority**

They made for him what he willed of elevated chambers, statues, bowls like reservoirs, and stationary kettles. [We said], ""Work, O family of David, in gratitude."" And **few of My servants** are grateful.
(34:13)

And [We cursed them] for their breaking of the covenant and their disbelief in the signs of Allah and their killing of the prophets without right and their saying, ""Our hearts are wrapped"". Rather, Allah has sealed them because of their disbelief, so they believe not, **except for a few.**
(4:155)

[So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, ""Load upon the ship of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed."" But none had believed with him, **except a few**.
(11:40)

David] said, ""He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - **and few are they**."" And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to Allah ].
(38:24)

Just look at the world around you and what it’s like. How many people are chasing this world and how many people are chasing the hereafter. Even among the Muslims. And Allah (swt) says a person will get what he works and strives for...

Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter - We increase for him in his harvest. And whoever desires the harvest of this world - We give him thereof, but there is not for him in the Hereafter any share.
(42:20)


Al-Qurtubi reported: Umar ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, heard a man saying, “O Allah, make me among the few.” Umar said, “What is this supplication?” The man said, “I refer to the saying of Allah the Exalted: And few of my servants are grateful.” (34:13) Umar said, “All of the people know better than you, O Umar!”

religion,People make me turn away from god.,"I'm going to keep this brief because I'm losing my will to be articulate. I find it harder and harder to believe in God the more I'm around people. The times when I'm alone I feel peaceful and a divine presence, but after being around others at work, family, or even at church I feel contempt for the world. I only think how there could be no personal God to allow the atrocities that we do to each other, not just the day to day nastiness. Yes I read what Jesus has to say about brotherly love such as in John 4:7 or Ephesians 4:2 but it only gives me temporary relief. How can I even trust in the church when I see hypocrisy? Every thing my pastor says sounds like lip service, or an ego trip.How can I take the church seriously when there is a cabal network of pedophiles in it and so much corpution and intolerance? I even go to Buddha to learn about lovingkindness mediation, but this seems impractical in a Western society to me. So what am I  to do? I feel my only option is to do what Jesus has taught about following him in Luke 14 25-27, take up my cross and abandon everyone and go somewhere alone as a hermit, so I may have a relationship with God.

He would be allowing all the evil and suffering that is happening on this planet.
He would let children die and give people such a huge difference in life quality just based on where they were born.
Depending on what god you believe in, he would send people to hell for not believing in the right god, even though they were born and raised in a country where they never had the chance to believe in this god.

I was born catholic but I wasn’t into the faith and my mother converted to Christian back in the 2010’s, I believe in a God but I’m not religious, my boyfriend fell out of how his mother makes Christianity to be. I don’t have a problem with any religion and respect it, and I told his mother this, but I’m not a church goer, and don’t like being forced into something.
It’s a year going on two with my boyfriend, we had breakfast with his mother, his aunt, and these two pastors (a old married couple) it’s been about 4-5 months forcefully having to go to church just so we can be together. In the morning when his mother invited us to come to breakfast that the pastors were going to be there, I kinds saw ahead I was going to be uncomfortable I didn’t want to go, but my boyfriend wanted to just so he wouldn’t have to wait to cook breakfast but to get it made for him, we ended up going.
It was fine greeting each other at the table, and waited for his aunt, mom, and pastors finish praying before eating.
It wasn’t til they brought up our relationship and telling us God doesn’t like that we’re together and we should get married. They told us they know we’re young and want to have fun, but it’s better to get married now and figure everything out after. My bf and I discussed marriage, we do want to get married but we’re not ready, we want to be financially stable (my bf is unemployed ) and we’re happy the way we are right now til then that’s when we’ll get married. 
It made me mad and I told them to stop talking to me I don’t want to talk about my relationship, we know what we want, we don’t don’t have rush things because they want us too. His aunt told me I was being disrespectful, I responded with an “I don’t care, it’s my relationship you’re talking about”. After all this, his aunt began telling my boyfriend I was the devil, that the pastors rather have a nice church girl and that I could be that. 
I don’t have a problem with Christians. But just going to the church my boyfriend stopped going for years, they’re very judgmental. No one likes to be told how to live their life. My bf and I talked while I was crying after hearing I’m labeled as the devil itself. That they don’t understand why they can’t force something on someone, and allow us to find faith ourselves, not be told this is right because they say so. 

I am wrong that I want to be stable before marriage?

religion,Isnt the argument that religion causes violence a simplistic one,"It's a very popular argument that people use. And it does seem to have anecdotal evidence to support it. But when you dig deeper into the evidence you actually come to the contrary conclusion. The encyclopedia of wars for instance did a study in 2012 where they found that only 6% of all the wars in human history were motivated by religion. That's 6% too many but the other 94% were motivated by politics, economics, land, etc. 

Moreover even in cases where religion is used as a cause or justification for violence, there is much more going on there and some cases religion is just used as a facade for the real motivations of people. Take suicide bombers. Many, especially recently, have used religion as a justification for their violence. However Robert Pape who is a prominent expert on terrorism did a study where he looked at all the major cases of suicide bombers since 1980 and found that in 95% of the cases religion wasn't the motivation. Geopolitics was. Or lets use another example. The Israel-Palestine conflict. People see that as religiously motivated and think ""if it wasn't for religion, there wouldn't be violence there"". Certainly religion is invoked by people on both sides(Hamas on the Palestinian and settlers on the Israeli side). What a lot of people don't know though is that before the 1970s, secular parties dominated the politics of both sides. In Israel, it was created as a secular democracy and many of the Zionists who helped found Israel where in many cases secularists or atheists in terms of their religious outlook. On the Palestinian side the PLO(Palestinian Liberation Organization) was the dominant movement and in the 50s and 60s it banned religious parties. So you had a situation where secular, non religious parties dominated the politics of Israel and Palestine in the 50s and 60s. What happened? They still fought and killed each other in 48, 56, 67.

Other planets also have the same thing, for example, the day on Venus is the equivalent of 243 of Earth days, and Jupiter has a day of about 9 hours in Earth’s time.

religion,Why do you believe in God/a higher power?,"So, hi! Following the loss of a friend, I’ve found myself in what I guess you could call a “crisis of faith”, even if the faith wasn’t really that strong to begin with.

I was raised Christian but nothing strict, yet I still took some things from that religion as universal truths. I’m discovering that that definitely isn’t the case.

One question led to another which led to 10 more, and so on. I’ve searched the internet to get opinions and experiences from others, which I find helpful.

However, as I’m sure you know, people online can be pretty rude. 

Anytime I bring up faith there’s always someone there to mock me for even entertaining the idea of a God, and telling me all the reasons they don’t believe in a higher power. The nature of the conversation was typically very condescending, and honestly, hurtful (though I’m a little sensitive...) 

However, I have hope that reddit will be better!

religion,Are there religions and philosophies which complement the worldly life rather than try to renounce it? How do you balance the two?,"I've studied (and even practiced some) religions and philosophies but they don't seem to complement worldly life very well. Especially the eastern ones, one way or another, preach renunciation. For those living the 'worldly' or 'the householders life', these paths end up providing limited guidance. Those who aren't concious of this, end up losing motivation for their responsibilities. I've had this and read about others who started to lose a grasp on their everyday life and goals, because spirituality (which I realise is quite broad a term) almost always puts this big emphasis on prayer, meditation, the 'live in the moment'. 

My life was going well until I got into religion and ended up studying it a bit too much, 'letting go' of material desires, almost all time just thinking about prayer and watching videos on it or reading books related to it. In the end I realised there was no end to this kind of study and it was making my life worse. For background I started with Sikhism and then got into Buddhism. I got a good experience out of meditation but the more I studied it the more I personally found the kind of lifestyle it preaches is a bit too passive. With Sikhism I just generally found it not containing any concrete evidence or argument for following it, or concrete instructions. 

Anyone else here had an experience where their spiritual beliefs ended up impeding their progress in life? If not how did you balance what you follow and your worldly life?

religion,The Christian Religion Was Made Just To Distract Us From What Jesus Actually Taught,"Religious people have many different traditions and practices they follow but none of it really has to do with anything Jesus taught. Jesus said to love your enemies, to not swear any oaths, to not divorce and remarry, etc. and most Christian religions says the exact opposite. The most prominent religious people of today are usually people who support the military, think it's wrong for a president to not swear in with his hand on a bible, and mention nothing about divorcing and remarrying. There could be no other organization so successful at nullify the words of Jesus than the very one which claims to stand for what he taught.

At least atheist for example talk about what Jesus taught sometimes and actually address what Jesus says but the Christian religion is able to not do that by focusing on their theological doctrines which they claim justify them not doing so. The best way to keep someone trapped is to make them feel like they're free and the Christian religion does exactly that.

religion,How did Christianity choose what to keep from the Torah?,"Jew here. Christians claim that their religion is a sort of ""sequel"" of Judaism, where Jesus is the messiah. Very well. Christian beliefs differ vastly from Judaism  (stuff like the Trinity, the nature of God who is only good, the original sin, etc...) and I have no issue with that.

Now some Christians will quote the Torah to support their beliefs (for instance gay people being bad because of Sodom) when the vast majority of the Torah is being ignored. There are 613 commendments in the Torah that regulate everything, why are only a few elements being applied by Christians? (I'm not talking about messianic jews or minor sects that respect them, but of the major Christian denominations). For exemple, observing shabbat is the 4th of the 10 commendments. The food laws goes on for pages pages. Circumcision is central to the religion. All of that is ditched, but then some Christians judge other people's behaviors based on the same book that gave these very laws

I know a lot of it was removed to help converting more people and convince the Roman to adopt the religion, but why are specific things being cherry picked and kept, and other ditched as of they never existed. If you want to ditch everything sure, why not, but then how is it valid to quote the old testament when it fits your agenda, and not about all the things you don't respect?

Is there a rationale behind which laws are still applied by Christian today, and why the other were given up? How can you quote a text to justify your behavior when most of what you do directly contradicts it? How were the elements k that are kept chosen?",1590194006.0

religion,Is there a religious prophecy that meets the fallowing criteria?,"Hey everyone

Im a former Christian. I’ve heard that there are “300 confirmed prophecies that had come true” in the Bible. After looking at them... Im not really convinced that its true. 

So I’d like to open it up to anyone of any faith to point me to a single prophecy that you believe has come true, and can meet ALL of the criteria bellow. 

The prophecy...


1. was made prior to the event predicted

2. was clearly labelled AND understood to be a prophecy

3. was known about by some sector of the general public 

4. prophecy was clear, not subject to interpretation 

5. was an extraordinary event, and not possibly explained by coincidence

6. was not something people could work towards fulfilling (like conquering a kingdom)

7. Was answered by a single person or occurrence 

8. must have an end date (otherwise it’s open ended and see last point)

9. was falsifiable (there needs to be a test we can perform to verify the conclusion)

10. prophecy and the evidence in support of it, cannot be the same source (that would be circular reasoning. Star Wars episode 3 is not evidence that the prophecy in episode 1 came true). 

11. prophecy must come from a single source 

I’m not looking for a debate, or to argue, just for someone to point me in the right direction son can look into it. 

For example, Star Wars Jedi prophecy states that

“A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.”

Part 1 does not meet criteria

4 - what does balance look like? Subject to interpretation. 

6 - people could work towards bending balance to the force and creating a child with no father. 

8  - no end date provided. No time frame. Wouod it happen before he gets married? After a specific year? 

9. No test we can perform to verify if he is in fact the chosen one or that there was no father. 

Therefor I reject that the prophecy regarding Anakin Skywalker being “the chosen one”. 


Thanks.

Why did allah create us to worship him? What is the point and what does he get from it? 

It seems a little odd that something so powerful and creative would create something quite negative like a test just to see who is good and evil? It's not really something you would expect of something that is supposed to be happy or joyful like god? 

Creating for the purpose to be worshiped can also seem a little egotistical too? Why does allah want the praise and the worship and us to follow his guidance and to test people?

I find this very strange because that's the kind of thing they would freak out if it was said about any other field of study. If someone said that about evolution (which is something ignorant creationists do) they would ask for a massive pile of evidence to justify that most of the academic and scientific community are wrong or have some kind of conspiracy.
But when talking about Jesus mythicism suddenly an opinion shared by the majority of academics who are people who actually spent their whole life studying the subject means nothing or they just have an agenda or they simply follow previous scholars without questioning.

By the way, I'm not comparing the certainty of evolution to the opinion about the historicity of Jesus which is much less certain. I'm simply making parallels between the experts of both fields. Of course there's much more evidence on evolution.",1577953257.0

Just the conversation itself has me nervous because I don’t want to seem apathetic or insensible. And the single most important thing is that I don’t just want to know how to “deal with them”. I’d really like to get to know them and (fingers crossed) have a nice relationship. Every parent of every girl I’ve ever dated has been either a bit crazy, or unapproachable, or not in the least interested in me and consequently I couldn’t possibly be less interested in them.

The following questions are the best that I could come up with. For those of you who might take the time to construct well thought out answers, I just want to thank you for taking some time out of your day to provide some possible answers for me.


-In terms of the Bible, what is the scientific and historical proof for its accuracy/inaccuracy? (For Christians specifically, with inaccuracies being discovered, is this due to interpretation of scripture or its actual meaning?)

1.)With scientific discoveries revealing new knowledge about our world, is God still a legitimate cause or just a crutch for the unknown? (For example, a few hundred years ago, people believed seizures were caused by demonic activity, but we now know that the real reason lies with the brain. Does this discredit God being the reason or only change our understanding of how God works?)

2.)If the Bible is true, how should it be interpreted? (How do you differentiate between literal and metaphorical truth?)

3.)Is God still actively involved in the universe today? (Did he create the universe in its entirety and remove himself, or does he still cause specific events to happen?)

4.)If God does not exist, where would the energy contained within the universe come from?

5.)With our perception of reality itself, how do we know that everything exists? (Without a higher power, where does reality itself come from?)

6.)What is consciousness?

7.)Is a “higher existence” possible outside the space and time of our universe?

8.)Is God an actual being, or rather our closest answer to what the universe is?

I beseech You in the name of this day, which You have decided to be feast for the Muslims,

وَلِمُحَمّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِه ذُخْراً وَمَزِيداً

*wa limuhammadin salla allahu `alayhi wa alihi dhukhran wa mazedan*

And to be safety and increasing honor for Muhammad—peace of Allah be upon him and his Household—

أَنْ تُصَلّيَ عَلَى مُحَمّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمّدٍ

*an tusalliya `ala muhammadin wa ali muhammadin*

(I beseech You) that You may send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,

وَأَنْ تُدْخِلَنِي فِي كُلّ خَيْرٍ أَدْخَلْتَ فِيهِ مُحَمّداً وَآلَ مُحَمّدٍ،

*wa an tudkhilany fe kulli khayrin adkhalta fehi muhammadan wa ala muhammadin*

And You may include me with every item of goodness with which You have included Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,

وَأَنْ تُخْرِجَنِي مِنْ كُلِّ سُوءٍ أَخْرَجْتَ مِنْهُ مُحَمّداً وَآلَ مُحَمّدٍ

*wa an tukhrijany min kulli su‘in akhrajta minhu muhammadan wa ala muhammadin*

And that You save me from any item of evil from which You have saved Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,

صَلَوَاتُكَ عَلَيْهِ وَعَلَيْهِمْ.

*salawatuka `alayhi wa `alayhim*

May Your blessings be upon him and upon them.

اللّهُمّ إِنّي أَسْأَلُكَ خَيْرَ مَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادُكَ الصَّالِحُونَ،

*allahumma inne as’aluka khayra ma sa’alaka `ibaduka alssalihuna*

O Allah: I pray You for the best of all that for which Your righteous servants have prayed You,

وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِمَّا اسْتَعَاذَ مِنْهُ عِبَادُكَ الصَّالِحُونَ.

*wa a`udhu bika mimma ista`adha minhu `ibaduka alssalihuna*

And I seek Your protection against all that against which Your righteous servants have asked Your protection.",1590308421.0
religion,Question for the religious people here- how much time do you spend with your religion’s holy book or books?,"By spend time with, I mean read, listen to, study or engage with it in any way.",1582375729.0
religion,How can I choose between religions?,"I want to convert to one of the religions I’m drawn to. The problem is, I’m not sure how to choose. I’m drawn equally to both Shinto and Islam (I wrote Buddhism before for some reason? Sorry if that was confusing) which are pretty different. I can’t do both. How can I choose between them? Also, people who’ve been through the same thing, how did you choose between multiple religions?",1578275166.0

religion,I've long felt that there an interesting and underlying psychological theme in two key points in the Bible.,"If human beings are given something good, there's the possibility (only the possibility) that they can become abusive with it. It happens at the beginnings of both the Old and New Testaments. Adam and Eve are given Eden, or Paradise, and they go too far in their error of misusing it. Then, God gives his only Son to the world to spread love, to end in Him being abused (I'm using very general terms here). It seems like just one of many interesting psychological aspects embedded in each of the points given.

It may be to further impress that everything really is about choice.",1597782561.0

religion,How can I find the strength to not be filled with hate and anger by the police brutality gripping America?,"I believe in loving all people equally, and I always try to do that. It's so hard to maintain a pure and loving heart in this way for me when I am surrounded by evidence of injustice by those who are meant to protect us all. Seeing police attack innocent people with impunity up and down America is making me filled with rage, and I don't want that, I want to be filled with love. I don't want to be a hateful person, even though their actions are worthy of hate.



Can someone help me with some guidance please? 



Thank you.",1591281270.0

religion,Whatvdo you think happens in the afterlife?,"I'm a pagan who believes in sorta different afterlife than a lot of other pagans believe in

I believe if you were a good person in life, you will go to a positive afterlife (what that is, we don't know) but it doesn't require faith in the gods and goddesses to go there. But if you were dedicated to a god or goddess matron or patron style, you will go to their realm.

If you were negative, you will be going to a hell like afterlife. But it's not forever. You'll be tortured for a while, to know what your victims felt, get to know your lesson, and destroying the negative parts of you.  And then starting over again (reincarnation)",1586327072.0
religion,Christianity and Islam are the only proselytizing religions.,"Sorry to be so generic in the heading but I needed to catch your attentions.

It has occured to me that other than christianity and islam ( the two largest religions fyi) no other religions have a major proselytizing culture and some do not even care like judaism. Infact many jews believe that you can not convert to judaism but have to be born into it.

And I know there are some movements like iskcon (in hinduism) that might go around preaching but the vast majority of hindus I notice do not care about converting others.

Whereas in christianity and islam there are 100s of organizations and movements interested in this cause.

Your thoughts on this.",1585710276.0
