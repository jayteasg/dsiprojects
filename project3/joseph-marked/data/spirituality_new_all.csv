,spirituality,"The Black ego experience is an incredible opportunity to evolve. When you feel that your heart is pure love at its core, and that from it comes grace, beauty, joy and kindness, but you are painted as hardened, unmotivated, highly reactive, and aggressive... it's an obvious sign that the ego world and the inner world cannot match up.

When you feel like a hero on the inside and the world tells you you're a hero on the outside, it's easier to buy into the lies of this world. But when you feel like a hero on the inside and are painted as the villain on the outside, you are forced to decide which to believe. Every single day your inner and outer worlds will be in conflict. The person your heart knows you are and delights in you being cannot coexist with the person the outside world too often meets with fear, pity, and annoyance.

If you are living as a Black ego, and you catch one whiff of your true self, never let it go. Push through the dark night of the soul. Let the inability of your seemingly inescapable ego to protect you frustrate you until you're out of your mind. Let the reality that you will never be fully seen or understood wash over you and tear your heart open.

To be clear—bigotry is *not* part of spiritualism. If your ego needs to delegitimize or dehumanize another person or community, then you are the kind of person that spiritualists are attempting to challenge—not a spiritualist yourself.

A big part of self-analysis includes understanding how societal forms of oppression have infected our perceptions of ourselves and others. If you are not able to turn inward and engage yourself in this capacity, your path to spiritualism is wholly superficial.

“I love everybody but just can’t gender trans people correctly” is not acceptable. “I believe in Universal Oneness but think people of color should quit complaining about the racism they experience” is not acceptable either.

True Oneness with others involves understanding the limits of your subjective lived experiences, and it also demands we acknowledge and validate the subjective lived experiences of others...especially those we have been societally taught to ignore or minimize.

I want to deny it, but I can't find any reason to. And the rest of the future sounds insane. Like something from fiction.
I even told my psychiatrist about, because any sane person nit knowing if they're insane or not would. She didn't suggest to me that it could be fake, she gave me a theory to how it could work.

,spirituality,"1.) The Eye Spy Game:

Make a list of three things you wish to see. Keep these 3 items fairly simple (you can make them harder as your skills develop).
Go about your day and if you see anything on
your list cross it off. This helps your manifestations grow stronger.

2.) The Wallet Game

This manifestation game was made popular by Abraham Hicks in the book ""Ask and It is given"". Keep a $100 note in your wallet it could be a $20 or $50 but $100 is best if you have it).Visualize yourself purchasing an item with the money, then visualize yourself opening your wallet to find the $100 again and again.

3.) The Imaginary Bank Account

The imaginary bank account is all about manifesting more money and abundance. Pretend to open up a bank account and be your own bank manager. Every time you do something kind for someone else, add another $100. If you see anything you want to buy. mentally withdraw the money visualize purchasing the item.

4.) Universal Guidance

Guidance from the universe could be anything from synchronistic numbers, feathers, or even a physical sign... as in a billboard that reads ""You asked for this!""
The key is to tap into your intuition.

5.) The Communication Game

This is where you pick a particular person and visualize them reaching out to you. This could be a txt message from a crush or a phone call from someone you choose. Use your mind to send a telepathic message to your chosen person in order to pull them onto the same vibrational frequency.

6.) Checks in the Mail

the biggest mistake people make when trying to manifest wealth is that they avoid their bills like the plague! Next time you receive a letter that looks like a bill, imagine there is a check inside. Get excited, celebrate and build feelings of joy instead of dread. This eliminates a poverty mindset

7.) Hide and Go Seek

One of the best ways to receive blessings from the universe is to constantly be giving to others. Hide money in random places for someone else to find... Attach a note with a message of love.

,spirituality,"On the day of Halloween, my friend who I consider is spiritually connected to me told me not to go out that night. She was really anxious that day as it was the second full moon in October which is considered a bad omen. That morning her cat had to be taken to the vet for an emergency and she was scared she might die. Me being me despite her warning ignored her and went out that night to party anyways.

On my way to the party I got in a car accident. I was passenger in a cab and sustained a concussion and whiplash. In hindsight my personality and interests shifted over night. I was suddenly more interested in spirituality and understanding the meaning of the Bible. I figured out how to do my astrology natal chart reading shortly after my accident, whereas before I only knew what my sun sign was. It made total sense to me and I went further into digging deep to find out more about spirituality and about myself.

 I did a meditation one evening and I met who I think was a spiritual guide which I never had seen in any meditations I have done before. He looked like a lion with wings, and shortly after I learned that it is one of the beasts from the apocalypse in the Bible. I went down a rabbit hole of looking into Revelations in the Bible. I would listen to teachings by Jordan Maxwell for example and read books like Secret Teachings of All Ages. What didn't make sense before started to make total sense to me.

The more I learned the more I felt like the matrix that was my life before had completely shattered. I can listen to music/watch a movie/watch the news and understand the messages that I was blind to before.
