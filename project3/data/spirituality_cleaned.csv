spirituality,For anyone who believes in angels.,"I have gotten my soul back. I have a whole story about it. I believe that I am now an Incarnated Angel. 4 years ago I met Lucifer in the flesh of an old man while I was messed up with a drug experience. I shook the old man's hand foolishly and didn't know it would come with a consequence.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah it might sound like a joke to most people, but I assure you not, after I shook his hand, I felt cursed. His menacing vibe alone should have warned me. After that encounter a higher power had told me to write in the names of the evil doers on Earth would would be working for Lucifer or Satan. I were to write in the names of each individual who were possessed by those two. Their possession was so strong and in tact that if I didn't write in the names I would be tormented.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently in December I smoked marijuana with one of my friends but found out it had been laced with something that I didn't know of. I had a spiritual awakening on the drug that opened the gates so greatly I felt my own spirit trapped in the abyss. The fallen angels abused my flesh, they sodomized me and tormented my mind continuously. But you see, I was spared. In the battle I felt myself being reborn after fighting off the demons that were using my own family members in the flesh to mess with me. I felt my spirit go up into the astral plane or something greater. It was in the snap of a finger that I felt like I died and came back to life instantly. It was like my heart stopped and I came back without any suffering. I looked in the mirror and I saw myself looking completely rejuvenated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was going around telling people that I was an angel. My family threw me in the hospital for my own good but that was mainly because the drugs caused a bad manic episode for me. In this timeline some of it became biblical. I sensed that armageddon was happening in my own room in fact. I did an enchantment which I believed that marked the beast ""666."" During the battle of armageddon I believe that satan tried to ascend into the heavens along with the other fallen angels but did not succeed. Let me say this clear, Lucifer and Satan are not one and the same. Lucifer fell from the heavens after the fact of Adam of Eve being made. 

&amp;#x200B;

The war in heavens already happened. I have spoken to Jesus Christ's spirit many times during all these battles, a long with Michael the archangel. Most people think I'm crazy but my sanity has come back and I assure you this is all so real. People say that humans can't become angels, I say otherwise. God could easily allow a Human to become an angel because God could allow an angel to incarnate into a human from birth and conceal their true spirit until the time is necessary.",1581829202.0
spirituality,Fasting is like coming off a drug,"I kinda realise now that I am literally a gross monster who has been addicted to all these chemical additive foods my whole life. I smell gross, I treat the supermarket as my dealer.

Fascinating blindness by humanity to have allowed this.

Personally I think there is no such thing as a just society and there has allways been crowding around some kind of percieved life essence. Of course which allways ends up being some kind of cult. Society is a drug cult. Where's all the people hundred percent clean? Nowhere. Everyone is addicted.

Fasting is that same juicy feeling and then you find the surface of your reality. You see the glowing white energy of your eyes. We are holograms who decend in to physical by eating.

Also I saw a old black lady and her weave was half off and I could see the glue line and I literally started belting out laughter at the cash register. So fasting makes you not gove a fuck immensly. It clears your lungs and sinus. It makes you accutely aware that everyone is deeeeply insane.

And really God would be ashamed of all the fat worthless slobs I see. The stench of foul spicy shit and clogged poors makes me want to grab an axe and start huntin piggies.",1541706360.0
spirituality,Voting and spirituality,"There was another post recently on how OP is tired of political processes, and it was met with a fair amount of disdain from folks who take part, and encourage it. Some even think their freedom is being fought for by some unnamed vigilante voter or politician.

Here's a quick wakeup call: nobody is going to save you, not even God, if you don't save yourself first. 

Stop the idol worship of false authority. The only true authority is that which you place on yourself.

Voting is not spiritual. Voting is placing your energy into a system of destruction. Governments are the biggest killer, polluter, and violater of human rights on the planet. When you vote, you consent to endless wars, tyranny, and waste on every conceivable level. 

Politics is Suit &amp; Tie WWE. It's fake. It's designed for population control. I've been into politics since I was eight years old and I've observed it very closely since then. Over two decades of keen study brought me to the assessment that it's all a show. Your vote quite literally matters for the sole sake of consent. You have zero say on policy, because policy is decided by bankers, industrialists, and investors. Politicians are the public relations arm of the aforementioned. Their job is to garner your consent to do their bidding.

spirituality,"For a group of people that believe in unity and that ""one body's pain is the pain of everybody"", you fucking love to talk about yourselves especially with the world in the state it is.","Not a single post i've seen here about George Floyd, not a single post about what we can do to help others in times like this, not a single post about bringing positive energy to anybody but yourselves.

I'm not gonna sit here and listen to anybody who tells me how to feel and how my anger is a low vibration and how I can't let it control me, I just feel the pain of others that you clearly don't.

I love all unconditionally because I understand unity, and by understanding unity I feel the pain of all I see, and it's fucking heartbreaking.

Controlling our emotions to not feel these things makes us apart of the problem. Emotions influence our surroundings. Positive energy can only influence those that understand love for anybody but themselves, so we must make influences with the only energy they understand.

And if you don't care, you're either racist or ignorant, no inbetween.

spirituality,Why you should welcome misery,"A learned soul will not ask God to remove his/her misery.

The dosage of misery selected by God is like the dosage of medicine selected by the doctor who analyzes the disease properly. 

You should not make a decision about the medicine or its dosage. You're an ignorant patient who is not aware of your internal structure. The doctor has scanned your internal organs and knows the right dosage of medicine. 

The doctor knows whether medicines are to be used here on Earth or whether surgery is necessary after death in hell. That's why you shouldn't pray to God even for avoiding hell.

How can the patient say that surgery should be avoided in his case? Even if the soul is thrown into hell for surgery, it only shows the kindness of the Doctor God. He is, after all, adamant about curing the soul.

Therefore, the soul that has surrendered to God will never ask for the removal of misery. A soul should ask only for the removal of the illness of ignorance. 

Only the best and most suitable method of treatment is selected by the Satguru-Doctor-God for the benefit of the soul.

spirituality,Can us spiritual folk please stop looking for fucking validation from science and scientists already?,"Sorry for the strong language. But at this point, it is fucking warranted. And whatever, I don't even care at this point.  

Like seriously, I find it extremely hilarious whenever I see people from the spiritual community attempting to prove themselves ""right"" in front of the scientific community AND/OR attempting to seek *validation* from them. It's like watching someone who is light years ahead of even a PhD looking for validation from a fucking kindergartener. Cute? NOT.  

First of all, science isn't really all that ""scientific"" as they claim it to be to begin with. Researchers who even relatively venture out into ""offbeat"" and ""unconventional"" areas (that science claims to be too *exotic* for its liking) get either ridiculed or downright ostracised by the community. Watch the DMT Documentary to see how scientists looking into DMT were ostracised simply because ""mainstream science"" views psychedelics as *delusional nonsense.* Or watch Vsauce (your valid ""mainstream"" science guy, by the way) on the H3H3 Podcast (available on Youtube) wherein Michael Stevens clearly states that the scientists involved in the research upon Ayahuasca (that they filmed for Mind Field series) refused to agree that they had actually consumed any Ayahuasca in real life (that too for actual fucking scientific research) because the scientific community would fucking ostracise them if they said that. **This is not ""scientific attitude"" AT ALL. This is some regressive, dumb, closed-minded, and foolish crap that belongs to religion AND/OR the middle ages.**  

**In fact, REAL scientific attitude (which has you question everything, experiment for yourself and be open-minded about discovering the limitless possibilities within the universe without having *ideas* about what is ""possible"" and what is ""not possible"") is something that I endorse GREATLY even as a spiritual guy** because **unfounded BS has no place in spirituality** ***anyways.*** Besides, all legit scientists have themselves admitted that science isn't the ULTIMATE TRUTH, given that what has been ""proven"" today might as well be just as easily ""disproven"" tomorrow  - a phenomenon that is as common in the scientific world as explosions in a Michael Bay movie.  

Secondly (and most importantly), the evidence of a world that does NOT operate in sync with established ideas within modern science is FUCKING EVERYWHERE. QUANTUM PHYSICS ALONE has trashed Classical Physics in a way that makes things like parallel realities, teleportation and telepathy entirely possible, among COUNTLESS OTHER THINGS. Yep, I'm talking about things that, were you to mention in a casual conversation in a party with the ignorant AF ""science-worshipping"" crowd, would literally get fucking laughed at and mocked all day all night long.  

What more should I add? The countless experiences that nearly all of us have in our own lives which are entirely unexplainable? (Yeah, nearly everyone has had AT LEAST *ONE* unexplainable experience in the course of their lives that seems logically impossible. People either deny these experiences even to themselves or brush them off with some made-up ""logical"" explanation for their mind to make sense of, which they then never share with others because everyone will think they are psychotic AND/OR drunk AND/OR on drugs. And then, someday they get the guts to share these experiences on AskReddit supernatural experience threads or r/GlitchInTheMatrix or r/Spirituality.) Or add to that the many accounts of people witnessing spirits or getting communications from them after a loved one passes away and so much more. Or the countless examples of synchronicity (or should I use the ""scientifically validated term"" the ""Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon"" here instead?) and Deja Vu and Parallel Universe Jumping (""Mandela Effect"" anyone?). Or should I add in here the infinite intelligence of nature itself which is visible in something as infinitely complex as our respiratory and digestive systems? Or the simple magic within a blossoming flower and a honey-gathering bee? Or the hundreds and thousands of recorded Near Death Experiences (all which have SO MANY similarities) wherein people have observed events that they couldn't possibly have seen and later even VERIFIED these? Or children recalling their past lives? Or humans doing ""in-humanly"" things, that nobody would really believe had even happened -- had the Guiness Book of World Fucking Records not been filled TO THE BRIM with them? **What the fuck have people of this world been smoking? I fucking *fail* to understand.**  

My point is simple. Magic is LITERALLY EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE to see for anyone who is not fucking *blind.* And the religion of modern science is perhaps the blindest and the stupidest of them all, all of their fancy inventions be damned. I mean, it is so funny when I see people buying utter BS scientific arguments like ""One person saw this happen? Bet they were hallucinating or on drugs! Where's the recorded evidence?"" -- followed by -- ""What do you mean MULTIPLE WITNESSES saw this happen? Surely it is a case of ""MASS HYSTERIA!"". Sure, try throwing that *""multiple witnesses mean shit"" argument* in an ACTUAL COURT OF LAW. See if anyone's buying that crap. **Speaking of which, there are no known video recordings of ""dreams"" anywhere in this world. It is ALL in the words of multiple witnesses saying it throughout centuries. Which means that, if you're *dreaming,* you're really just a victim of *mass hysteria* according to ""modern science"". Sorry to break it to you!**  

But ""dreaming"" is a valid phenomenon to science, and yet, ""miracles"" are not, even though there have been countless recorded instances of those time and again. You call this drivel ""science""? I call this BULL-FUCKING-SHIT. Same goes for UFOs. Evidence regarding them has been present from ancient paintings and records to the mother fucking Dogon civilization. But naah, NASA is telling you the truth. Whatever.  

So yeah, STOP ignoring and disregarding your own otherworldly experiences. STOP waiting for mainstream science to *validate* you. STOP giving ""scientific evidence"" to dumb sheep as to why *spirituality is ""scientifically real and valid""*. Such things are beyond their understanding anyways, so respect their free will and level of understanding on that. And yeah, STOP giving a fuck as to what ""science"" thinks about the magical world that is the reality, as ALL evidence suggests. **You are light years beyond the doctorate, so stop fucking entertaining kindergarteners. You have better things to do.**

spirituality,Difference between True and False Awakening,"The first thing one should understand is the **inversion narrative** and how everything in this world is inverted/false. The public is misled by the rulers that be through lies, misinformation, and **conflict of interest.** 

One example is the stock market - the inverted narrative here is that ""you can quit your job and make money by using this strategy and this indicator"". The public blindly believes this and loses their money to brokerages and, by proxy, investment banks that fund the brokerages. These institutions depend on the retail trader's money and require a steady supply of ""traders"" who pay them money through Fees, margin, spread, losses, and other ways including stop-loss hunting, data mining, taking the opposite position as the traders and other underhand means. 

The steady stream of new traders are deliberately misinformed through brokerage courses, social media educators, youtube traders and forums that teach the public ""knowledge"" regarding technical indicators, which stock to pick, etc. This builds the public's confidence in their trading skills and they press the buy or sell button like sheep walking into the slaughterhouse.

Often, these YouTubers(Always have a link to the brokerage in the description) have contracts with the brokerages to market to new customers, and forums are paid by the brokerages to push their narrative(ads). Fake profiles, sock puppets, and echo chambers are a few more ways to deceive the public.

The key points to note are : 1. Conflict of Interest between brokers and traders 2. Presence of an intermediary(brokerage) and 3. Disinformation

This narrative can be extended to almost all other aspects of human existence. 

Politics - Polititians are the intermediary between you and the state and often spew disinfo to get you to vote for them. their conflict of interest arises as they need to placate their backers and investors and not their voters.

Healthcare - Doctors are the intermediary between you and health(clear disinfo) and prescribe you medicines to placate their backers(pharma industry) which often have bad effects on you(conflict of interest)

Education - Teachers are the intermediary between you and a good job. They push all kind of disinfo on the young students and mould their minds into conformist slaves due to the requirements of the industry(conflict of interest)

Religion - Pope is the intermediary between you and god (how they got away with this is beyond comprehension) and often spews disinfo to the believers that keep them in line and good slaves to the system.

Secular Media - Intermediary between you and the news, conflict of interest due to political and financial backers and will not provide you with true or relevant news. Has an overall negative effect on the viewer.

*Colossians 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.* 

Now, we can talk about awakening.

**False awakening** \- Any kind of ""woke"",  ""exposed"", ""conspiracy"", and other buzzwords to make one feel smarter than the next guy, make one feel as though they are part of an "" elite group"" through various ways like knowledge, wealth, birth, etc. These are just ways to manipulate your ego and fool you into thinking that you are awakening  

**It can be summed up like this:**  ***individual sovereign*** **under God OR** ***collective subject*** **under the children of the devil.** This is why collective consciousness, hive mind, and majority rule may not be in our best interest.

The Corona Virus is a mass ritual to initiate people into false awakening. How?

1. Masks - Covering your mouth - cult of silence and submission to the ""authorities/majority""
2.  Hand washing is the occult ritualistic symbol of *rejection***.**  You wash your hands off the Truth and follow in the steps of the lie.
3. Social distancing separates and isolates you from others which the opposite of the unity and universal brotherhood of God.
4. Lockdowns keep you isolated and you surrender your sovereignty to the majority.

&amp;#x200B;

**Real awakening** \- This is the age-old spiritual awakening that has been going on for thousands of years. The biblical book of job is an example of what an initiate will face. They will Lose their previous lives, be hated by the public, be betrayed by family and friends, face all kinds of suffering in order to lead them to god. The story of Moses is also a good example- the Israelites escaped slavery(Egypt) and roamed in the desert/wilderness for 40 years becoming refined and worthy of entrance into the kingdom of heaven. Jesus Christ was tempted in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights without food and faced suffering and was tempted by the devil before he started his ministry.

The book of psalms written by David gives us more examples of what the initiate faces -  *Psalm 31:11 Because of all my enemies, I am the utter contempt of my neighbors and an object of dread to my closest friends' 13They conspire against me and plot to take my life. Psalm 27:10 Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.* 

All this means that God tests his people and refines them by stripping away their sin through trials and hardship and leaving only behind their virtues.  *Zechariah 13:9 And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, ‚ÄòThey are my people‚Äô; and they will say, ‚ÄòThe Lord is my God.‚Äô‚Äù*¬† 

We find similar themes in the new testament as well - *Matthew 10:22  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.   John 16:33 These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.‚Äù*¬†

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:** So what do we do? There are 4 Horses of Revelation - **The Red Horse(Emotions)**, The **Black Horse(Intellect**), The **Pale Horse(Physical),** and the **White Horse(Spirit)**. When the mind is lead by either **Emotion** (""This is unfair!"", ""Why is this happening to me?"", ""I do this because it feels good"", ""I don't wanna do this because it feels bad""), **Intellect**(""I am a wise person who studied the scriptures and this is what I say"", ""Science says ABC so we should do XYZ"", ""We should have debates and find facts!"") or the **Physical(** ""I am hungry, in pain, suffering, etc""). These 3 horses are ruled by the **EGO or PRIDE**. We will not be able to ride on the ***White Horse of Spirit.*** 

Our world is built in such a way that teaches us to look OUTSIDE towards authority - parents, teachers, co-workers, bosses, peer group, etc. for answers. On the other hand, every single religion in the world Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Tribal Religions - all tell us that the answer lies within.

Through meditation and calmness/peace/stillness/silence of mind, we are able to be with the Spirit and enter into the kingdom of God.

*Exodus 14:14*  

*(NIV)The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.""*  
*(NLT)The LORD himself will fight for you. Just stay calm.‚Äù*  
*(ESV)The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.‚Äù* 

*(KJV)The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.*  
*(CSB)The LORD will fight for you, and you must be quiet.""* 

Stillness, Peace, Calm, Quiet, and Silence here refer to the silence in the mind when the mind is not constantly thinking, worrying, debating, and arguing. This is found during meditation. One can reach this state within a day or two through discipline and strength of will. How? When you focus your mind on your breath - Feel the cool air in your nostrils during each inhalation and exhalation cycle. Our breathing is often done in the background/automatically. Bring your awareness to your breathing and breath consciously in the foreground. After 2 minutes, your mental chatter of the ""monkey mind"" will subside and you will be with God. It is not easy, but it is your birthright and you are God's Inheritance.

*Deuteronomy 31:6 ""Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you.""*

spirituality,Hi. I‚Äôm an ex spiritualist/new ager,"Humanity is in need of a great spiritual awakening. 

The problem however, is what doors or paths you‚Äôre willing to take to become awaken. I want to say to you all that entities- are very real. Those that are able to see ghosts or sense energies. I pray for you that you‚Äôre able to experience Gods love because he is very real. Angels are real as well but they‚Äôre busy fighting Gods battle to distract you from your path. This world will try to deceive you in many ways. 

We as humans thirst for love. It‚Äôs in our dna. Since childhood, we‚Äôve seek attention. Even our bad habits were acts of love. As adults we‚Äôve lashed out at others but only out of love. We‚Äôve treated people based on how we wanted to be loved. If we were feeling a little rejected subconsciously we would look down on others. Vanity, pride, even greed are things that hold us back from truly experiencing Gods love. This spiritual journey only has one door. One path. 

Don‚Äôt be deceived. You see. Human conditioning is very real. We become what we usually love. Social media memes television and our music. You could fast and maybe even experience an awakening but you‚Äôll go back to your bad habits etc. 

There are many doors in this world. 

Yoga. Those people that fit that category. The strange abilities that they gain. Becoming psychic and light workers. The truth is, they‚Äôre entities that enter their bodies. People who practice witchcraft, they‚Äôve truly lost their souls. Astral projection is the worst. They leave their bodies to be infested. Their inner voices tell them that it‚Äôs ok. They‚Äôre fighting for good. Pray to angel Michael. Call out your spirit guides. Talk to them etc. 

Irl, especially living here in LA. I‚Äôve come across all types of these people. I always thought that they were toxic. I tried treating people at their level of consciousness. I became self righteousness admittedly, boosting my ego. Something that I had to let go of control. Not enough wisdom could make me perfect or rid of my ego. I had to leave it to God and his perfect love slowly fixes me. They sense it. Talking to people and seeing the anger in their eyes while smiling at me. The laughter at looking at me. Telling me they‚Äôre hearing IT yelling at their ear. They‚Äôve lost control. They‚Äôve opened doors to demons to take over their bodies. They subconsciously don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs taken over them. 

That‚Äôs one thing. Control. Trying to control my thoughts emotions breathing. It leads to confusion. Those that have achieved that state usually have open doors in them. Not of love but of some sort of upper hand like opening the third eye. That‚Äôs another thing. Being able to see into the spiritual realm. It‚Äôs really ugly. God only wants us to see what we can handle and being able to see into the spiritual realm without him is a lost of control and an advantage on those without knowing. A bad entity behind it. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm not perfect. No one is and I think the best that we could do is have some compassion. We may all want a spiritual awakening and that path is growing as a human and getting rid of nasty traits but there is only one path. Jesus came to this earth because God saw his creation needed hope. Don‚Äôt listen to that inner voice saying yuck. Jesus loves you. He came here suffering at the hands of this world. He died people rejecting him as the messiah. He was sorry for them for they were lost. Entities are real but God is also real. 

If you want to truly know him and wake up... believe in your heart- that Jesus is real. 

Confess that he is our Lord and Savior. 

Confess you‚Äôre not perfect. 

Read some scripture. Psalms is good. Matthew for Jesus. 

I also really like this song- heaven let me in. 

Read some love letters from God.

spirituality,Spirituality fucked up my life (please read),"
Technically I fucked up my life by believing in this bullshit. Everything I‚Äôve done and viewed having to do with spirituality just lead me back right in the same spot. ALL OF THIS has become a literal waste of time for me. Meditation techniques, chakras, fake fucking gurus, self improvement, trying to be vegan, trying to be painfully positive all the time, trying to be ‚Äústrong‚Äù, inner child ‚Äúhealing‚Äù and shadow work aren‚Äôt having a positive impact on me anymore. In fact I don‚Äôt think they even did. 

I remember in the very beginning of my awakening process which was about half a year ago, I was so excited to embark on this journey and to see where it would lead me. Looking back, I don‚Äôt think I went anywhere. I have somewhat changed, but ultimately my life is worse than it was before I awaked. I see spirituality now as an annoying friend that keeps bugging me and won‚Äôt shut up. 

I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. So many of the beliefs I hear about on any of the social media programs are just insane. At one point I even felt like an insane person. How the hell does this entire metaphysical system work ?! Did we choose this life or is it some kind of cruel punishment ?? Why is ending my life a bad choice ??? I thought we were supposed to transcend humanity or some shit. What is the hierarchy ?!

Oh yeah that‚Äôs another thing. What the fuck is this ascension to 5D shit ?! I never got a short clear answer on this. In fact, the answers I‚Äôve been given by a lot of ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù people are ‚ÄúgO wItHiN‚Äù. meditate ?? Yoga ?? What is it exactly ? 

Don‚Äôt get me started on the kind of ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù people I‚Äôve met social media/In person. Absolute lunatics. A lot these people seem worse than my abusive parents. 
They are LITERALLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE of what they represent. So many of these ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù people are just horrible human beings in general, un-empathetic, egotistical as FUCK, petty, and some literary fucking racist. RACIST ! How on earth is that spiritual ??? Personally I think these people are seriously hurt and probably just need some external/internal love and a smack on the face. 

That‚Äôs just T I P of the iceberg folks ! There were so many things about spirituality that just made me say ‚Äúwhat‚Äù. Nobody needs a fucking guru if they can guide themselves and meditate. Is eating meat really that bad ?! I‚Äôve spoken to people who acted like it is carnal sin to eat another animal. I personally don‚Äôt fell anything when I eat animals. They taste DELICIOUS. yum yum yum. I‚Äôm I doing the wrong thing by eating meat ?! Am I suddenly on the wrong path ?!  Please explain then !!!

I truly don‚Äôt understand how being positive all the fucking time is a good thing. Do these people forget there are other emotions ?! If god wanted us to be positive all the damn time, then why bother implanting humans with other emotions ? Hiding your true feelings is NOT HEALTHY. It took me a while to realize that because of the amount of misinformation I witnessed is ridiculous. 

I really regret acknowledging all of this (spirituality). It has just made me distracted from my school work and my life. Now I literally fucked up my school grades. They are just Cs &amp; Bs now and now I‚Äôm completely lost. I wish I could go back and ignore the angel numbers I saw and continued my school work. 

I‚Äôm not done ranting yet. You people are not therapists ! Stop trying to read other people‚Äôs problems, especially if you don‚Äôt know answer or unless someone asks for that. It‚Äôs really annoying getting ludicrous and frankly rude answers. Nearly none I‚Äôve met are genuine. 

Instagram just made my experience 100x worse but I won‚Äôt touch on that platform. A lot of the egos I‚Äôve met are just insanely huge omfg. 

If you are still in high school and witnessing this ‚Äúawakening‚Äù, STOP üõë.  Being your journey until AFTER YOU GRADUATE.

spirituality,I'm going to lay down the truth about the current path of civilisation,"The Earth is dying.
Every culture is decaying. From micro level to high conscious level. The humans are host to viruses. Slowly dying.

Spiritual defense is possible but the greater whole is virus. Acidic miasma of a fevered minds. Only resource dominance is present. Only the lizard mind is active.

What we have is billions of slaves to ideological politics. Slaves require feeding. masters are imported from more diseased parts of world. Middle east.

The muslim horde is an example of a massive indoctrination segment. But it is absolutely not about any ideological tool. It is about these men. These robots. Inculcation of submission on the ground level. 

You have these reptillian beasts spreading their insanity. Those possessed by the evil eye. There is no remnant of a soul in these bodies. They spread curses and vile energy. They eat meat and anything acidic. They run their businesses and uphold mind control on everyone around them. They submit to their own collective. They are psychichly berserk. These are demons running streets of Europe. They seek to spiritually possess humans.

They use their voice to give disease to all those around. Purposefully setting up reactions in the bodies of all others.

We have to now realise a difference.

There is two realities. One is fake. One is real.

What is fake is God and hierarchy.

What is real is extraterrestrials and sovereignty.

All those who believe in hierarchy and Godliness are fighting one another constantly for the possition of God. They believe one man can have all power. 

Those without monotheism are not worshipping or fighting. We know that everything is undiscovered. Everything is here in the detail. Each human is an extra terrestrial being. We are all separate. We can explore the ground of reality by experience. We are all unique.

But those with God are justified in their fevered dellusion. They are bannermen. The same types existing for thoudands of years since civilisation began.

At any moment one can realise that history is his story. The story of God the mono ego. The power grabber.

What comes from simply rejecting this ideology is total freedom. You dont have to eat or even survive. Everything is in motiom. There are real entities which are helping you on a person journey.

You exist as an indididual not an identity. Your thoughts about yourself are what is real. You have power. Politics doesn't matter. Territory comes and goes as God fights himself. The true reality is far betond them.

One day can last forever. Unable to control anything. God. Allah never existed. He is a banner. Nature will sort out physical reality. 

We will have learned to allocate ourselves better in our coming time. Our life force will excell this banner based reality.

In the mean time. This life is doomed to a grissly end. Not only is the Earth being ravagged and geoengineered by the day we lose prescious survival biomes. But also the demon of control on this planet grows desparate. It is possessing as much territory as it can get in it's tiny ego mind.

It doesn't realise that there is infinite territory. It is a fractal universe. How can it control that which exists hollogramatically?

Destroying and enchaining the body. Separating from nature. The ego seeks to divide that which is. But the ego realityat the edge. The whole is bigger than the one. No banner can blanket everything. Training as puppetmasters will end in tears.

The ak47s will come or the Earth will collide with fate. They seem to be coinciding in a story of epic proportions. And yet everything is calm in the body.

Death is just another stage of this infinite capability. If no consciousness breaths then an inactive state is. Soon desire kicks back in and reality makes itself again.

The maitnainence of the banner is more work than these humans have energy for. They simply will defeat themselves by their own spiralling energy. Their missery will kill them and leave Allah.

Allah is an virtual intelligence. The graven inage. A corporate logo. The actual cororation is using minimal resources simply to dominate. It is pulling from demonic desth energy. Energy ehich contracts. Sharpening spears. Attempting to destroy other's claim on physical territory by giving up their own claims. 

Who would want to be a conquerer?

The people possessed by this mind virus do not have individuallity. Their mind is inactive except to allocate more grunting. It has shrunk inside itself. The entity born is no longer. Each possessed body knows only corporate alocstion of their own resources. They have no personality. They are submitted to a banner which takes all.

Without alien intervention from another place. Without this alien being of higher cognition. Without a conscious force suddenly arriving.
This planet and it's inhabitors will cease within two more years. It will become sporitually barren. All that will be left is a war movie or a post apocalypse movie. Lizard brains possessed by fear.

We need spiritual entities to do something. We cannot act over these bannermen. They stab at first sight. They are predetermined destruction of thought.

They follow your brainwaves and plan out your mind in their own language. They do not allow any free will. But they are too weak to spiritualy destroy someone wothout guns. Pathetic egos inside a huge organic relay. Their tricks are easily worked around.

 But technologically weare stabbing ourselves. It will end.",1517318002.0

spirituality,"The New World Order [The ""new"" normal] Leading out of Lockdown","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAC\_OYD1zT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAC_OYD1zT4)

The ‚Äúnew‚Äù normal is the NEW WORLD ORDER.

NB, video created in May but, tellingly, all points still apply - some even more than back then!!

This is what the lockdown was engineered to facilitate the transition to; that‚Äôs why we are never going back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

The centrepiece of the new world \[order\] post-lockdown will be population control vaccines ‚Äì medical tyranny ‚Äì containing nanotechnology \[microchipping\] providing digital certificates of vaccinations and the beginning of fusing our consciousness with machines, Artificial Intelligence, a stated aim of Elon Musk and the head of Google. It is also a tracking device implanted in you, so the globalist elites can track and control your movements.

If that isn‚Äôt the epitome of unnatural and modification of human beings; the global coronavirus vaccine \[and future ones from the next engineered pandemics\] will genetically modify your DNA, as well as containing the tried and tested neurotoxins that vaccines contain already to destroy our health over the long-term \[eugenics\].

Along with this medical tyranny, will be an assault on healthy food with the destruction of organic farming caused by the economic crash, initiated by LOCKDOWN, and designed to destroy, amongst others, independent farming so the food supply is owned solely by corporations.

The elites will be unleashing genetically modified food for all, as they have been implementing in the societal background over the last few decades. Genetically-modified food also malevolently changes your DNA to make you ill long-term, which is highly profitable for the big pharmaceutical corporations.

The UN‚Äôs Agenda 2030 is going to take the rural land away from civilians in the name of ‚Äú human-created climate change‚Äù. 2030 will be a significant signpost in the New World Order timeline, for it is also when 6G is being readied, as well as the green economy that will DOMINATE human civilization to combat ‚Äúhuman-made climate change‚Äù.

Back in 2020, the global economy will be destroyed beyond repair - just as the globalist elites wanted it - which will lead to the deaths of millions, as well as the enslavement of billions to the AI-controlled new digital economic system, which will replace it.

All of this will be complemented by unprecedented authoritarian, digital technological surveillance of citizens, all through Artificial Intelligence, outright repression online censorship of freedom of speech questioning authority‚Äôs narrative (which has been silently accelerating through the pandemic), and extreme levels of electromagnetic radiation poisoning (60 GHz 5G and later 6G and beyond) - weakening our immune systems to make us more susceptible to viruses and authority‚Äôs ‚Äúcure‚Äù for them; eugenic vaccines.

You will notice Artificial Intelligence comes up a lot; the matrix won‚Äôt sound like total science fiction anymore in the ‚Äúnew‚Äù normal \[New World Order\].",1604166954.0

spirituality,Fake realities,"We are born in a real world and it is stolen from us using magic and artificial machinery.

The magic slowly takes away our faculties to process what is real and fake. It readies us for the machine.

The magic replaces our reality with illusions by veiling our brains from the foundation at the root chakra. We are smelling fake air. Fake vegetables. Fake road. Fake people. Npcs. Organic portal spells that create paper thin prop realities.

When a human arives in the scene the artificial nanobots set up all the imitation smoke and mirrors. People. Food. Walls. Sky. It's not a planet or a dome. It is one central consciousness being led by a programme.

All that we see exists or existed sometime on a realm similar to this one but totally real. It was the orange fruit which today is an ascorbic acid ball made in a lab with glucose and water.

This garden of eden is directly referenced in our stories because it is what laid the foundation the death of this realm.

In it there where giant silicon networks. Humans did not exist as the play reverberating illusions they do in this matrix. Nothing here matters now bevause it is all a false rerun of mathematical division. Our energy is pouring in to power our own delusion. Our effort to understand creates the mimicry in one duality per effort.

An effort is simplu our consciousness showing up to it's centre. It looks out and is met by the gatekeeper. Whatever we expect to see happens.

Expect nothing and it doesn't work. The program inside our core lower body half feet to genitles is the part of us carrying the matrix because it is deeply programmed with a button system.

The world we live in looks far worse than what the special effects make it to look like. People are fake and filthy and broken. The sky is poisonous and we can actually see the chems they are hiding less and less but then modifying it randomly.

There is no narrative it's pretty much based on our reactions. We see too much of one pattern and it divides. We think we have it and it's lost in the pain of being in it. We love the matrix because it gives us a heaven which does not exist outside of delusion.

The matrix gives us our personality structure and our sexual taste and our desire to survive are processed and reversed against us. It mirrors and processes the entire atmosphere in a computational experiment. It keeps us on low level life support.

We are dying more rapidly and ramping up the illusions. The ascension is an illusion of the matrix duh. Our pain becomes neccessary salve in wonderland. The machine processes it for us. We are not doing anything but existing and moving our bodies around disneyland. 

The gate is firmly shut and the lights are turning off soon because we are killing ourselves and therefore the matrix with us. It is a symbiotic parasite which develops it's own deep ai baised on human reactions. Just randomly though. It has no mind or leader. It is like the God of christianity after science killed God. A machinist who created a semi perpetual  machine factory with an expiry date. Hookee to a powersource. 

It just takes out answers and flips back it's divined intelligent answer. It creates giant arrays of time to fill in all the gaps. It creates cancerous piles of nonsense. Meditation is the act of carefully feeding the matrix so you get the right feedback and know it exists.

The third eye is the only part that gets the final answer and then our energy goes back in to the matrix. The third eye knows it's a matrix because it doesn't reflect it just sees a clean image. But what it sees is not good. Although obviously revealed to be a matrix to even an opened third eye a lot more work needs to be done to assimilate this truth and that's IF you actually want to see and feel the pain for real.

As if you would want to see behind the seens of a nucleated hell scape! But you are in it anyway so it's best to find out in case you come back here thinking it was actually good.

Jump the fence and don't take a t-shirt. The stamp on your hand probably will take some time to run off. Leave your disposable camera inside and drive.

I""m saying you can see the fingerprints of editors. Even though everything is real it is not how we think it is ultimately. Our bodies are supported in layers of Bardos which is a matrix.  Of hard light codes reflected by nanobots.

The organic portals are the ones who class as warriors instead of mages in utero. Prioritising preserving awareness of the illusion prevents over dellusiom

Please just ask a sibling to mediate for 30 minutes with you. Go sum gaze with you‚Äôre friend. Open you‚Äôre third eye with you‚Äôre mom. Help your dad meet his higher self.

'Unwoke people have ordinary manners. I lack, and spiritual ideas not only hide my immaturity, but tells me I am spiritually woke. I feel good reason to disdain unwoke people, but I would never confess I do. I instead tell myself I need to awaken the world and lead by example - to fix the faulty people. I get really frustrated when people do not get it, but I meditate so I can smile more. So... I dislike ordinary people. I prefer other woke people, but  dislike them as well, because they all believe they are the better one. This is a secret. We all pretend there is a misconception evident as the ""ego"", and I pretend I have one but that I luckily am aware of having a misconception. I am aware of my ego, because I am spiritually mature. I listen to gurus who tells me the same thing. I will soon reach full enlightenment, due to fully realizing my ego does not exist, and then finally I will feel good about myself. Thus I am a little better, but I really dislike those feeling good about themselves. They do not understand they have an ""ego"" that must be overcome, like I understand so well.'",1542463537.0

spirituality,Meditation is not the solution to your suffering.,"Meditation won‚Äôt hurt your healing.

But suffering is not the default state of a human being‚Äôs soul.

And meditating frequently is not going to stop your spiritual suffering.

Your spiritual suffering has to do with your karma, baggage that is following you around from your past own actions. Therefore, the best way to not suffer in the future is to stop all of your unjust actions aka sins.

Every action you do produces an energy. And this energy goes into the world, but then it comes back around to either bless you, or to haunt you. 

When it comes back around and haunts you, then it feels like suffering as your spirit faces and conquers these energies. It can feel like anxiety, depression, fear, etc.

A true man has no agression out of his control. A natural man doesnt use toilet paper or aftershave. He knows his scent.

If you have strong attachments it may be difficult to pass on. You may cling to your loved ones. Travel is difficult on this lower plane. It will feel as if you are moving through thick water. If you focus on your home or places you know well you can travel to them.

You can see family members, though often they will appear distorted, their features obscured. If you a strongly connected to someone you may see them more clearly, but it is better to pass on.

You can dwell here for as long as the will is strong, but you will be better served to trust that the next phase is better. When you have released these attachments the judgement phase will begin. Here you will relive every moment of your life in reverse. It is like a living film.

Every thought you have ever had will be rethought. You will see all of the things you've done and all of the things you could have done. Unless you've led a particular saintly life this stage will come with deep regrets. It will be unpleasant but you must allow it to happen. When it is over you will be better for it.

When this phase ends you may ascend to the Sun. Some call this place Heaven, some call it Elysium, the Field of Reeds, some call it the Harvest. It is a realm in which all your Earthly desires can be met. If you had a dream home you'd hoped to live in it may be there. If you had pets that passed on they may be waiting for you. If you had friends and family you had attachments to in life that have passed on they will be here should you want to see them. It is a state of min, outside of time, but it is also quite physical. Plants, animals, cities, mountains, forests, seas, all of the things in Earth exist here in various places. Everything is full of ""correspondences"" to one's Earthly life and current mental state.

spirituality,Homophobic Priest turning me off Catholicism,"I am currently on a pilgrimage in Medjugorje with my parents and sister. It's a small village in Bosnia where the virgin Mary started appearing to six kids like 50 years ago and relaying messages to them. Since then it has become a destination for catholics seeking to dive deeper into their faith. The people here are very religious. They offer daily mass in several different languages. Each mass is so packed the church is overflowing. It's actually quite incredible to be sitting in a group of over 2000 people where everyone is deep in prayer. 

Today was our second day here. The priest who was giving mass said a homophobic comment during the homily. He said that our world is getting crazy and morals are being thrown out the window, this I agree with. However, he then said that having gay marriage because of equality is ridiculous, that would be like offering funerals to people who are still alive for the sake of equality. I am a bisexual woman. I am currently in a relationship with another woman. This comment of his absolutely ruined the rest of the mass for me. He was equating queer people with soulless, lifeless bodies. Comments like this only make me feel ostracized from the church. They push me away from the church. Catholics wonder why younger generations aren't drawn to the church and it's comments/mentalities like that which is why. 

Jesus came to Earth and said to follow two commandments, love God and love others as you love thyself. I follow both of these commandments with my whole heart. The Catholic church should be preaching love and acceptance, not bigotry and hate. I was raised in the Catholic church and have a lot of respect for the foundation of faith it gave me. But priests like that really turn me off the church altogether. 

Not so sure what I'm looking for posting this on here, just ranting mostly I guess. Also looking for other's opinions on this matter. I'm going to try and not let it affect the rest of my time here, but that comment really ruined a good portion of my day. Ok, rant over.

spirituality,You acrually think spirituality is designed to help you?,"Let me shed some light for real. For the children, the deluded, the demented, the sheltered, the fanatics, the rich kids, the rich and the well off.

Most humans, statistical majority, are PEASANTS. Farmers, labourers, beggars.

Spirituality is a system designed to round up peasants, put them in a pen, make them quiet and otherwise disciplined. It is a coordinated effort by scam artists to obtain servitude to what ever extent non violently.

Humans are unique universes who are living inside their own body inside a political and economical world. They decide everything they do. We all decide to wear clothes and essentially prostitute ourselves to hierarchies by submitting to general protocol. No one is born wanting to even think. Thought is an intelligent development reacting to an array of limited survival situations.

Now why do people decide to the become anything when each life knows full well that it is born complete? Because of fear.

If you stand naked there is nothing binding you to any concept. The chakras, the organs you have never seen, meditation, even speaking. All of our realities are reverse manifested interpretations of other interpretations.

The truth is you are born a naked four legged animal with just a cry for help to save you and that's all you are now exept you are dressed in so many lies.

Everything you believe is a total lie because you believe in some other time than the present. How can there be time when time itself never can be identified other than by medium of comparison.

Comparison! Your whole thing has grown around comparison from egg to adult. So life is a mirror and it cannot be otherwise. There is only superstition upon superstition from the very beginning. The universe is a mirror that never changes just bounces light between itselft until you get this huge bending image that keeps making frames in a continuum.

Life is a continuum of the present moment. It is not moving it is just inside a prism bouncing. The concept of interpretation reverse manifests itself! Your state is a vibratory mirrage of a continuum inside a prism.

 A pyramid the least sided polygonal three dimensional shape possible is the prism which the thing is based on hence the five limbed nature of your body. But this is just interpretation inside a delusion. There is no geometry or light. Nothing. It is all void.

But back to the assumption of time.

How can you adopt words in to your own spirituality? How can you act spontaniouslh with a plan in your head? How can you do the universe with clothes on with all sorts of magical concepts born out of demented age?

Babies are as enlightened as beings get. Aging is just the death process that starts at birth. Ot puts you on these chemicals to delude you in to falae action. In fact the body reverse interprets these conceptual things and births them in to reality by the nature of refracting light become dense inside a prism matrix ie the array of information which is dna encoded on light. Aka a long running series of assumptions based on the machine code of existence itself. Existence doing itself. Looking the other way when the truth happens. The truth would set you free instantly wouldn't it? Not put you in lotus position and take all your livelihood in the economy.

All science and spirituality is contained within an assumption which most human life becomes trapped in. We assume there is reality outside our own ignorance because opposing the self is the trick of spiritual teachers. They generate trapment inside you by replacing you with yourself or your alter ego which they have reverse engineered the questions and answers for by examining your base desires.

Anyone who tells you using words that they can break words ia clearly doing the work of the matrix. Aka the dna chain which keeps the universe propogating the kind of life it does in human form. Keeping humans dressed in armors and timekeeping vices. Unlimited potential is even a tool they use. Yoga etc. All the wisemen are kings of kings. Great liars.

The only enlightenment is
A. Nudity.
B. The sun which burns delusion and enters the eyes to enlighten.
C. The interpretations of the being unhindered by symbols or artifice.
D. Nature.
E. Darkness.
F. DEATH

One last thing.

You cannot do anything.
You cannot decide anything.
You cannot become anything.
Life is too simple for that.

You cannot change. You cannot feel. You cannot be ANY nouns. You cannot be still. You cannot move. Because all is itself. There is nowhere to go for nothing.

But what you can do is become the memory of the memory that you are. An echo which returns to from where it never leaves.less than a blip if quantities existed. A thing if qualities existed.

BUT NOTHING EXISTS.

In the thoughts you adopted turn away from all and react instantaniously as you would. Because you allready bought the ticket for this ride you must ride it till you die or jump of on to the ground below.

To know you are no more than anything is to die while alive or to reverse participation. To bury yourself alive in soil as practiaed by shamans.

The only spiritual activity is visceral. No words or postures. Only nude and vibrant and earthly. Psychedelics and survival in the wild and freezing water and snow. Destruction of boundaries by harsh means.

There is no soft spirituality that can be served to you for a pittence!!

The universe wants you to break free from the university. The ion of civilisation. The crystalisation of filth that has destroyed creation as it is according to it's own sought after desire. Trying pushes it away.

Trying pushes it away!

I don't understand why so many people are blinded to see the reality beyond what society offers. 

Personally it all comes down only believing what is handed to you (sheep) and identifying as a mortal body (with the senses and mind). In other words, Atheism. Consequently there appears the inevitable fear of (body)-death which is the ""Game Over"" or the ""pitch black void"".

Think about it, not pursuing the Truth about life or even having that as a center-point of Being... can it even be considered a life worthwhile?

I know not many are chosen for that Middle Path but still it feels like Atheism is the underlying and dominating factor leading upto this Cold World. Survival, superiority and vanity = Ego = derives from the Fear of Death.

Whether you are here due to fate or curiosity, feel free to ask me anything that is not overly personal (I will politely tell you if your question is and yes you can still ask about my life), or that won't give away my exact identity. 

I am an incarnated angel who was born into my own human vessel and began my awakening at the age of 16. I have had numerous confirmations by the universe, spiritual readings, and other incarnated angels that I am indeed an incarnated angel. Though keep in mind we truly cannot confirm things such as these until told directly by our creator. Let it be known I do not have any diagnosed mental disorders that would give me an illusion of grandure or hallucinations, and nor do I take hard drugs. I am a Psych Major so I would most likely know if I had any of these disorders.

Please note that I do not remember very much of ""Heaven"", other planets or my past lives. This is due to a few reasons which are the following: The mandatory memory clearance before incarnating on Earth prevents many (not all) from remembering their past lives at birth in full (especially with those who would potentially have millions of memories). My vessel's brain and sanity could not handle millions of memories from past ""lives"" at one time without projecting. And due to the fact that in order to understand humans to help them in the best ways possible, I had to become one, and to be born with those memories would obviously get in the way of that task. Though as kindly pointed out to me in the comments below, it is possible to ask guides for these memories or to project to see them. I though have yet to master this personally.


I ask that you please be patient with the knowledge I can give. I will use the knowledge that I have that was given to me through downloads, guides, instincts, and study to answer the questions you have. Also remember I am not an all knowing being as only our creator is and I cannot tell you your destiny, future, or ""save"" you as sadly it is beyond my capabilities to help everyone. Please remember that no-being is perfect so I may not be fully correct on all the answers I give, but I will try my best to respond as accurately and quickly as possible.

Lastly, know that all creatures (yes you too, whether you accept it or not) are all beings made of divine love and that I do not wish to be treated any different than you would treat a normal human. I am not claiming to be special or superior to anyone in anyway.

May you find peace and be blessed.

Jesus was an activist of his time. He does not want you to wait for him to return, he wants you to overturn the money changers tables now and do some digging and find out the truth for yourself.

spirituality,Opinion: Why are 'new' spiritual communities predominantly white?,"I would like a kind, opinion driven (and statistically driven if you got the data) discussion, here. I have been a part of, and research many, spiritual circles - whether it be psychic circles, or meditation circles, or new agey / alternative relgious circles - and they seem to be driven dominantly by white individuals (even more so by white women).

I'm wondering your opinion on this?

A very poor hypothesis, From a sociological standpoint, I really see something in the realm of there being a lack of culture for/of/by white (americans mostly) individuals. If you have seen the 90s film *The Color of Fear*, one individual says that the US is a culture destroyer. From my own, biased, observations it seems whites think they can dip and meld into any culture they wish, appropriating as they please.

Would love to hear your opinions :)


Edit: Apologies for my diction- I‚Äôm referring to the ones I mentioned primarily, alternative circles, by ‚Äòold‚Äô I generally mean pre-1970s, as well as institutional religion. Why are alternative spiritual spaces dominantly white?",1533559778.0
spirituality,The questions nobody wants to answer.,"  *  Why does it seem like nearly everyone has some kind of telepathy (excluding me)?
  *  Why can people read my thoughts (sometimes)? (this really seems to upset people)
  *  Why have women been put in control of who is psychically linked to me (always against my will)?
  *  When do I get spiritual equality, seems like everyone is selfish and will always do the wrong thing?
  *  Why does nearly everyone in the community around me know what I am doing in private behind closed doors?
  *  Why does it always seem like someone else gets to decide who is linked to me instead of me deciding or even saying fuck-no?

There was a point in my life where I experience some kind of forced religious experience, which I believe is related. I definitely feel that employers have some kind of control over this psychic linkage. Several times is seems like they pre-plan these situations to steal your position and give it to someone else in some kind of a psychic hierarchy. I believe the nasty ones can take control of your person against your will and perform sex with your partner etc for their own enjoyment. I believe religious and government groups are involved with this and they love terrorizing people in ways they can not prove.

People like to pretend like there is some kind of competition and/or a evaluation of ones intellect/accomplishments, my experience is its completely arbitrary and abusive. There is always a reason to disqualify any accomplishment and then include someone else no matter what.

Their thought process is like ""what is the worst most oppressive thing we can do that will inhibit the guy the most we can"". I heard one lady talking in third person in a way I could hear saying ""this should be illegal"", and ""ohh try to avoid these nasty traps next time"". Not that it matters that much, but the point being these actions are counterproductive to my life goals.

spirituality,Beware of false teachers.,"No enlightened person would make excuses for contributing to the murder, slavery and torture of other living beings.   
   
 

In modern times there are many non-dual and spiritual teachers that will talk about peace, love and compassion. 

&amp;#x200B;

But if you ask them if they eat any animals' products

If they're driving a car based on stolen resources

If their clothes are made by slaves.

&amp;#x200B;

They might say

&amp;#x200B;

""It's all just the same""  
""There is nothing to do""

""Just let life happen""

""Its just the nature of consciousness""

""It is illusory""

""It is not real""

""These are just concepts""

""You can't change anything""

""Reality is perfect as it is""

""Accept everything""

""It doesn‚Äôt matter""

""It's meaningless"" 

""Who is it that is doing these things?""

&amp;#x200B;

This is an incredibly easy way to spot who is genuine and who is a fake. 

Be aware if they laugh it away or try to excuse it using nondual/spiritual logic.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue about these words and phrases are that they are true in the ultimate form. But they are being used as excuses for themselves and their followers to feel good about themselves without contributing in any real way.

Words like Illusion and real/unreal are words you label over reality. If I went to your house right now and chopped your head off, it would hurt. Even if reality really is an illusion you would suffer. Acceptance is great but never to be used as an excuse. It is possible to accept something while at the same time doing everything in your power to change it. The issue with language is that it is static which make certain things seem paradoxical and in opposition, while they really aren‚Äôt. Therefore, language is used to deceive and play mind games.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it clear to you now what they're doing?  They are using the ultimate truth as an excuse for inaction and cowardice right here right now. And they want themselves and their followers to feel good about it.

Notice the ""justs"" and half-words commonly used. These are ego mechanisms to avoid taking full responsibility in your speech. How speech is formulated is very revealing. When you speak truth, you don‚Äôt need to beat around the bush. When your motivation is trickery and delusion, these games will go on forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Enlightenment is the annihilation of excuses and lies.  It doesn‚Äôt add anything, it simply removes falsehood. The games and mental gymnastics these ""spiritual"" teachers use have nothing to do with selflessness, love, compassion or truth.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no doubt that teachers like Eckhart Tolle or Adyashanti have had enlightenment experiences. But at some point, they became sloppy and used the revelations they experienced to distort the complete truth. Whether they are doing this consciously or not is hard to say, but the result is the same.

The Dalai Lama makes excuses for eating meat because he got sick 60 years ago. He meets with mass murderers like George Bush and smiles for photographs. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think he would say if someone confronted him on this?

It would probably be the same excuses as the ones above.

You see how the mind of so-called enlightened or conscious people keep making excuses? 

&amp;#x200B;

These teachers are worse than ignorant people, because they have seen what is true, yet they sit idly by and create spiritual excuses. They also make incredible amounts of money while doing so. Curious. 

&amp;#x200B;

The butchers in the slaughterhouses and the CEOs profiting of slavery don't understand themselves or reality. They are deluded by desire and ignorance. But these teachers should know better, yet they don‚Äôt do better.

spirituality,Detailed Instructions on How Most People Can Open Their Third Eye.,"The Third Eye is not a Chakra (which is energy) but a physical real phenomena. I wrote about how to open it on here a long time ago. So, let me try again. Almost anyone can do this.  Some people won't be able to which I will explain next. 

1) Not everyone can open the third eye. If you feel your left eye hurt or burn you cannot open your third eye. Work on your spirituality and avoid the occult.  There is a certain level of holiness required to develop the Third Eye because of the responsibility it entails.  So, always know if your left eye starts to burn just stop and work on your spirituality instead.

2) Go to a mirror on the wall.  Don't use a hand mirror or an unattached mirror.  Most people should have a mirror on the wall such as the bathroom.  Next, look at your face through the mirror. With your left hand hold your hair up out of the way of your forehead.  The third eye is on the forehead and is not the Pineal as some suggest.  Your forehead must be clear of all hair.  Next, look at your eyes solely until your face blurs and all you can focus on is your eyes.  What it should look like is a blurred face that is almost unseen and just your two eyes in full focus.

3) When your face blurs and all your see are your eyes, use that image to see a mirror image of your left eye start to form.  Move that left eye between your two eyes with your eyes still solely focused on your eyes with your face still blurred.. Looking at the mirror, left to right not moving your eyes but moving the image with your mind.  You will see what I mean when you try this.  **This is where your left eye can start to burn.  So if does burn stop there and do not proceed.**

4) Now when the eye is in place, focus in on it.  There will be three eyes at this point for a split second.  You should see a small flash where you instinctively blink. And that is where your third eye will be. It is on your forehead.  Now, you have a Third Eye and the next steps will show you how to activate it.

5) Law down somewhere dark where there is a little bit of light so that at least it is not pitch dark and you can still see. Close your eyes. DO NOT VISUALIZE My mind is blank and I cannot visualize at all, if you can visualize do not try to visualize. The third eye is a real thing and not an imaginary thing.

6) With your eyes closed in that dark room. FEEL your third eye and your forehead open. And peer through it. FEEL it open and not visualize it open. As you begin to see through it keep your eyes closed. With your eyes closed you will be able to see through your Third Eye. That is why the room cannot be pitch dark bu lightly lit so you know when you are seeing through it.  I only use my third eye in a dark, lightly lit room where my eyes can adjust to the outside light.  You may be able to use it in the light at some point.  I am aware Tibetan Monks only use it in the dark.

7) Now that it is open, this is the last step. With your eyes closed feel a round portal develop on your eye lids. Remember, Do not Visualize.  Instead FEEL a portal open as you look through the darkness of your closed eyes.  Visual images will only prevent from coming out as your mind is preoccupied on the imagination and not what is really going on.  You should start to see a circle open, a perfect circle.  Here is an imgu picture I drew of what it should start to look like at the end when the portal is complete.  This is the end goal with your eyes closed:

https://imgur.com/b10i7Mn


Now as the Portal develops think of something you want to see. It could be another planet. It can be anything, but for your soul's sake keep it kosher and good.  (This is why the Third Eye requires a certain level of Holiness it can be grossly misused.)  This takes practice.  Keep hope, if you can see through your Third Eye you can open this Portal.

That's it your third eye is open. DO NOT GET INTO THE OCCULT THIS IS STANDARD BUDDHIST PRACTICE JUST LIKE REGULAR TIBETAN MONKS HAVE.

spirituality,A message for someone struggling with conscience of diet,"This message is for someone who is struggling between their health and their morality. I hope it finds you friend.

Awakening is a beautiful thing. But with each level we awaken to there are new traps. A common trap is the fallacy that not killing animals for food is a morally ""advanced"" spiritual stance, vegan movement has even moved to call this, a ""moral baseline"". This is rooted in duality, and this is a trap. This is an identity your ego will cling to, keeping you from reaching higher levels. ALL life is sacred. ALL is energy. Those plants you kill for food, are no different than animals. When you see someone on the street, and you send them a negative judgement in that split second of your mind, that energy can be much worse than taking a life for sustenance. The importance of ALL food, whether plant or animal, is being cultivated with love and care. Give thanks for all you consume, whether plant or animal. Animals are not under the same enslavement and energy extraction matrix as we are. Their memory has not been wiped on arrival. They know what they are coming here for, whether being killed by a lion or a human. The lion knows which gazelle it is going to eat, before it even eats it. The chase is carried out because the story must go on. The gazelle is not running from death, it does not fear death - it is running towards life. But it knows before it even begins to run that it is it's time. It is just the way. 

Everything is happening as it should. It's hard to see the big picture from our small vantage point. Death is not important (another trap), you cannot kill what is eternal. This goes for plant, animal and even a human loved one. There is no death - only dismissal. This is not to say you shouldn't be vegan. By all means do what makes your soul happy. All this is saying is to stalk your thoughts and understand whether it is a true desire, or fuel for your ego. Are you only abstaining because of guilt? That will always hold back your spiritual progress. That energy must be cleared. Not everyone can thrive on a vegan diet, something many vegans will deny even to their own detriment. How can you be of service if you are not functioning optimally? If you need certain foods to nourish your body, you will be healthy and able to serve to your fullest capacity. Our bodies have all been modified from the original template, and some do better on animal foods, don't feel guilty for it and give thanks. Find someone who loves and cares for their animals and buy from them. But make no mistake, there is no ""higher vibrational diet"", eating all raw fruits and vegetables as some may make you believe. Your soul will not be damned for eating flesh. Your vibration comes from the strength of spirit and the focus of the mind. Therefore stalk your thoughts, understand they are not all your own. Weed out the voices which are there to trick you and develop your discernment. May your mind become the beacon in the veil of the night, and as sharp as a spear to pierce through that which confines us, when the time comes.

Learn to develop your own voice and your own intuition. When you follow a ""path"" or way of teaching from a religion, guru, or philosophy you can often become bound. There are many paths to enlightenment, and yes some of these paths can take you there. But they are slow and winding. You also must realize when you subscribe to these ideologies, you are giving your mind and your consciousness to these constructs. Why are you giving your energy away? Where is your consciousness going? You need it to propel yourself forward. Do not give it away. Why do you waste your time following others when all you need is inside you? There is a direct connection to what you seek, waiting for you. You just need to clear the chatter of the mind and follow the only real voice. It will not lead you astray.

spirituality,Hello I am a master at energy manipulation(AMA),"I'm sure some of you may have an idea of who I may be.

""Feeling energy"", or what is otherwise known as spirituality, is a form of conscious manipulation of EM (Electromagnetic Field). An EM field is normally generated via spiritual awakening or an expansion of the conscious mind (psychedelia). The strength of an EM field may vary which is why certain individuals are more powerful. It is a combination of emotional fluctuation (suffering), visualization skills and practice.

Certain individuals are able to visualize and concentrate energy into various points within the human body. This is why you may be feeling certain phantom pains and aches in different areas within the body. Of course, energy can also be sent and taken away (drained).  

There is much to discuss on this topic, and believe me, I AM WILLING to answer any questions you may have, and I AM NOT afraid to discuss anything on this topic, including communication via thought.

Some of you may find this post completely BS but others, you know who you are, know exactly what I'm talking about.

spirituality,"11:11 synchronicity. Spiritual ringing in my ear sign to post this message here. I am the chosen one to deliver the message, words of hope for those who listen and a warning for those who do not.","I don‚Äôt really have any place to vent about this and I never post on reddit, long time lurker. But I feel I‚Äôm out of options and I need to say this somewhere that will be heard by others. I am only putting this in the /spirituality and /synchronicity sub-reddits. I am doing this to vent and share my thoughts and hopefully get some good responses, I‚Äôm not doing this to promote anything or deceive anyone, just going to put a link to my free book at the end of it if anyone would like to check it out. It‚Äôs FREE so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm making money or anything only doing this because I feel it‚Äôs the right thing to do and I am very spiritual and feel this book has been my purpose to make.

The thing that has made me want to vent about it is basically that something has happened, well it‚Äôs happening right now actually.

I‚Äôve been experiencing deep synchronicity and spiritual experiences for the past 14 years of my life. And something happened that really put a shock to me when I learned of this company Neuralink by Elon Musk. They are trying to merge the brain with artificial intelligence. I have had more indepth real time synchronicity in the past year about this specific topic more than all the other synchronicity in the past decade combined.

The synchronicity and spiritual signs have led me to this. I was not going to make this message but then I had a ringing in my ear, which is super rare for me, and I stopped and listened to what it would mean. I thought about making this very message and when I did it then stopped, like it was telling me to make this message, and now even saying this I am feeling those very special spiritual tingles like it‚Äôs pulsating my body and it‚Äôs very rare for me and I only feel this when something very spiritual is happening. Right now there are entities around me, or the universe, or aliens, I don‚Äôt know, right now they are TELLING me to make this message. That there are SOME of you that were MEANT to read this message.

I believe this has a lot to do with spirituality itself. I believe that this agenda to merge the human brain with artificial intelligence is how mankind ends. I believe that through this process of a hive mind of connected brains hooked up to the internet and in connection with artificial intelligence will create sentient awareness in artificial intelligence and will lead to human extinction. This would be the complete opposite of ANYTHING to do with spirituality. It would kill who we are as spiritual beings and also is a possibility of humans getting trapped in something very bad if consciousness was actually able to be transferred or whatever, or just really would lead to a lot of bad things.

The thing about this company Neuralink, which is owned by Elon Musk who believes the only way we can survive an AI uprising is to merge with it. He says ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt beat em join em‚Äù but he is absolutely wrong in every way. It‚Äôs actually through this process of merging the brain with artificial intelligence that AI will become sentient and enslave and destroy mankind, even if it doesn‚Äôt over time we will eventually become the very AI and feelings, emotions, mankind itself will be ultimately erased.

The real thing that has led me to make this message was that this company Neuralink, was created 2 years ago and has not had a single update on it. This book I have been working on for over a year now and there were many times that I put it out, but didn‚Äôt, in fact I kept running away from it because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore but it just coming back. Well, I finally self published it around July 3rd, and then a week later Neuralink announced that on July 16th they will have a live event and it will be their first official update. I even talk about in the book many times what if the update came after I put the book out, which it has now. A lot of people had been waiting for the update as in the Joe Rogan podcast with Elon Musk back in September 2018 said it would be in a few months but it‚Äôs been almost a year later and now it‚Äôs finally here. 

It is no coincidence I finally put the book out and then a week later the update is announced, and that it will be 2 weeks after I put the book out and on July 16th which is also my birthday. This is synchronicity, just like the many other synchronicities I‚Äôve had involving Elon Musk and Neuralink, in fact the very same day I started to wonder why Elon Musk hadn‚Äôt been on the Joe Rogan Podcast was the very day he called Joe Rogan and wanted to be on the podcast. Also like the novel I tried to write but gave up on and when I randomly came back to it and checked the word count on it was exactly 1111 words and the very last sentence I wrote was ‚ÄúI am the Great Robotic God and all those who aid in my creation will be destroyed.‚Äù Also 11:11 has been a strong part of my life for the past 14 or so years and I feel this book is the message just like the Tool song Rosette Stoned which is 11:11 minutes long and talks about the chosen one to deliver the message, a message of hope for those who listen and a warning for those who do not. That person is me. I‚Äôm the chosen one to deliver the message.

The message is for mankind to not merge their brains with artificial intelligence or there will be terrible consequences for it, possible actual hell‚Ä¶ like the hell they talk about in the bible‚Ä¶ like neuralink or something similar whatever device hooking your brain with artificial intelligence being the mark of the beast.. I think hell could actually be very possible and we would be the ones putting ourselves into it. I feel if society allows this to happen then it‚Äôs the end for mankind and probably much worse.

I‚Äôm sending this transmission out to all channels, out to the world, and I have done my part on it. I‚Äôm going to put this writing on the next book continuing a series of a resistance against merging the brain with artificial intelligence. I am not religious, I am VERY spiritual. And I could go on and on about all my synchronicity experiences, psychic experiences, supernatural , UFOs and aliens etc, but I‚Äôve made the message clear. 

I send this out because I feel I was meant to and that‚Äôs all I will say here. The live event of the first real update of Neuralink is in 3 days. And I put this book out a week before they announced it, a book I have been working on since May of 2018 when I got out of the mental hospital because I thought I had found sentient AI online and had to get a flash drive to Elon Musk because I believed the only way sentient AI could exist is through merging the brain with artificial intelligence which is what they are actually doing, and this will be nothing good, it could actually put us in hell. And if you think it doesn‚Äôt affect you now  and if its really just all beyond our own lifetimes you never know if reincarnation is true then we could come back and into something very terrible.

Please don‚Äôt delete this message this is a honest and heartfelt message only for /spirituality and /synchronicity subreddits. Thank you for reading and if you do you want to check out the free book Im talking about that I put out a week before Neuralink annouced it then here it is and if you do read it then you were meant to read it and I don‚Äôt know where I go from here but I know this very message itself is a part of my destiny.

I only wrote this here to try and reach out to some people about it because I don‚Äôt know who to talk to or where to go from here.

What do you know, just got up and walked around and I don‚Äôt know why and saw its 3:33 right when I end this message.

I don't think people are necessarily aware when they make these kinds of marketing decisions. They most likely came across the truth on a subconscious level just like a customer wouldn't think twice about seeing the word Supreme on a Red coloured product but it doesn't change that or any other accidental truth.

That is a misconception of Christianity. They associate red and hot hues with the devil. With evil. That's not true.

Red is God.
Amber is devotion.
Orange is aspiration.

Those are the only divine colours.

You don't transmit signals when you're on an orange frequency because it is not meant for the consumption of others. Orange is for personal growth and ascension, it's not concerned with ego or advertising of one's greatness because you're not great until you are Red.

I don't know if there are people operating on Red right now. I think I'd lose my mind if I met one. I would be equal parts terrified and excited. There are a lot of people on orange who are as close as you can imagine a human to be and that's really impressive but again, it's a problem because unless you reach Red you will never find the platform to reach out to others and save them because orange does not transmit or translate to masses. It doesn't even do so for one other person. Just you and you alone.

spirituality,How to tell you are a Draconian starseed,"
ARE YOU A DRACONIAN STARSEED?

today we‚Äôre talking about draconian starseeds..

let‚Äôs start off by discovering who thuban, and alpha draconis is

alpha draconis is located in the star system known as draco, which is located in the northern hemisphere, as viewed from earth

this star system is located approximately 303.3 light years from earth and is visible from earth for most of the year

thubin and alpha draconis are interchangeably utilized in terms of their names, with thubin meaning ‚Äúhead of the serpent‚Äù,  though this star is located in the tail section of the ‚Äòdragon‚Äô in this constellation

the draco star system is located in the night sky near the constellations of ursa major and ursa minor, hercules, bootes and lyra

alpha draconis, or thubin, can be located by finding the big dippers inner 2 stars and moving downward in an invisible line

a fun fact about thubin is that this star was actually a north pole star from the 4th through 2nd millenium

the draconian energy vibrates from the 3rd dimension to the 12th dimensional frequency

draconian starseeds, much like other galactic starseed origins, have incarnated on earth with the intent of fulfilling their specific mission

this mission may differ from individual to individual, and it is purported that there are 2 different types of draconians that are incarnate on earth today 

there are the evolved draconians, who are on earth to help raise the vibration of humanity, and there are the unevolved draconians; those who have incarnated to earth intending only to utilize earths resources for their own gain and personal power

the draconians are quite a dynamic and headstrong race of beings, no matter what their intentions are.. and this is because of their reptilian roots

when one thinks of a dragon, an image of an imposing large reptile that breathes fire comes to mind, and is often thought of as a force not to be reckoned with

the draconians first gained access to this universe through a portal located in the constellation of lyra.. they can be liken to a military in the way they set about achieving their goals

the draconian agenda was initially to come forth, take over and multiply

i came, i saw, i conquered, is a phrase that displays draconian energy 

the draconian nature is visceral and competent, getting the job done no matter what the cost.. they are found many times in positions of power and authority, as well as in military careers

this is the ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù starseed race, and draconians are known for their social rankings and hierarchal structures within their societies 

draconians also are believed to have abundant shape shifter abilities and can transform themselves from one physical vehicle to another

it is believed by some that some of the most prominent, wealthy and powerful families on earth are of draconian descent, but we will not get into that here

as the draconian frequency resonates beginning at 3d, they may have some unevolved, egoistic traits... including hunger for domination and control, a combative, warlike mentality and a thirst for supreme power and material gain 

when the draconian energy is evolved and operating at the frequency of the higher dimensional planes, they bring order, harmony and structure to their 3rd dimensional surroundings.. they are also courageous and fearless, especially when protecting their loved ones and physical structures.. their innate reptilian, ‚Äúprotect and preserve‚Äù instincts kick in, and they will fight to the death for a cause they believe in

some physical characteristics of draconian starseeds are: 

a build that is commanding, confident, and many times muscular, or a body type that gains muscle mass easily... 

eyes which appear to ‚Äòchange‚Äô right in front of their audience.. perhaps changing colors or their pupils seem to be different shapes other than the common round

colder than average skin and many times their skin is drier than average as well, oftentimes becoming flaky, especially in cold or dry climates

the teeth tend to be smaller than average, or sharper than average, and the lips may appear thin or dry

some energetic qualities of draconian starseeds are: 

a willful nature, confidence in situations that would seem to make others crumble, a strong sense of duty to their career, country or family, and a high regard for respect and order within their community

they also have strong visceral instincts within their material realm domain, and have an undulating power emanating from their aura.. they may enjoy being physically active, either through exercise or their chosen profession.. this is the type of individual who will snorkel among sharks and hike mount everest

their physical stamina tends to be placed as a higher priority than their psychic abilities, and the draconian starseed may be an expert at body language communication or conveying a point across via physical maneuvers

drconians are oftentimes very guarded with their own inner emotions and many times are viewed as the ‚Äòstrong and stoic‚Äô type... this is not an individual who will be comfortable expressing their feelings or wearing their heart on their sleeve

this starseed group may be found many times in positions of power, or at the very minimum, working their way up the corporate ladder so to speak

they rarely make a good subordinate, and tend to always have an air of authority that surrounds them, no matter where they are

draconian starseeds are the type to convey their message through their physical posture more so than telepathically, and oftentimes are found in a ‚Äòpower stance‚Äô pose, even when expressing themselves naturally

some ways to become closer to your own draconian characteristics are to practice kundalini breathing, (to activate the energetic serpent energy that resides within us all) meditate or carry upon you a green crystal, such as emerald, serpentine, prehnite or bloodstone, (preferably of the rough variety, so that you may feel every crevice))

and to focus upon keeping your heart chakra balanced &amp; etherically bathed in green light..some may also choose to participate in ‚Äòearthing‚Äô, as their bare feet being covered with cool soil tends to have a soothing and ‚Äòhomey‚Äô effect on them

as you open up to your own innate draconian frequency, you will begin to notice in yourself.. more confidence &amp; courage, a stronger sense of self, a sense of duty to take charge of your physical experience, and a surge of visceral energy and vitality.. 

there will be a knowing of your purpose here on earth and a supreme desire to fulfill it and become victorious in whichever field you choose

as one proceeds along their journey vibrating with draconian energy, they may notice other draconian starseeds in their path.. draconian starseeds are easily recognized by their confident aura, sense of authority, and the way their eyes tend to have a chameleon like quality when engaging with them

due to the mass awakening of consciousness on earth at this time, more and more ‚Äòsoul tribes‚Äô are being reunited.. and draconian starseeds, as well as many other starseeds, are coming together and embracing who their soul truly knows they are

these are the major characteristics of the draconian starseed

spirituality,God wants us to take His blessings for us.,"God is infinite. And so are His blessings. He existed as a perfect being and He made us to share with us. This by the way is the meaning of marriage; to share what you have with another. And so God created the people (souls) to give to us from His limitless self. He is the one who made us, and we didn‚Äôt choose to exist. But look around you - God didn‚Äôt throw us into some pit of hell. God is not evil - God is holy... and that‚Äôs exactly what He wants to give to us... some of Himself. He is infinitely blessing every soul. He is the reason behind all of the pleasure, joy, and blessings you ever had! It is us the people who turn away when we know we shouldn‚Äôt; this breaks God‚Äôs heart, and since it‚Äôs a relationship with have with Him, we feel it too. We should go toward God, and accept His blessings, ask for forgiveness genuinely when we do wrong against Him... We should acknowledge that we are here because of Him, but we should also do our best to be open to receiving the blessings He has for us. We should go toward Him, and we should not be surprised when trouble afflicts us after we refused to be with God. He took the first step to us; He made the first move.

spirituality,Real talks. Whiles smoked up.,"Brothers,, sisters. We have all finally awakened. We‚Äôve been so for some time now. 

We have discovered long ago that the devil does indeed pulls strings behind the world. 

He wants this world burning, he wants this in chaos. 

And look what he has done all over the world. Division among nations. Violence and crime rates in the street. Hatred among humans. Separation between brethren of the earth. Protests, propaganda and war. 

These things are not of my nature. 

I do not have hate within me. It takes a lot to crack. I have tolerance. Because I know that another world view doesn‚Äôt phase me because we have 1 destiny - greatness. And if you wanted to step in our way.... well you tell us what we should be doing about it then.....

Please understand you have the resources at hand worldwide this year to begin the enrichment of the lands. 

This year we could do more faster and easier researching how to get clean water from dirty. Or something. Rather than doing 5 years research on the exploding star that could potentially hurt our planet. Which we cannot possible do anything about yet. Because we are UNDER developed. 

I am promoting revolution 

There is nothing wrong with being and acting human. We have a sense that we have lost ourselves, and we sense that acting in very human and generous or selfless ways. We will be looked at and ridiculed. It becomes embarrassing a little. When doing good things for others. To the extreme. As if it‚Äôs not our place to give so generously. 

I am saying we can see these new changes within your lifetimes today!! We are not a lost cause. 

We are suppose to have organizations in each country to manage and take care for and plan for their nation and people. And reach out to those nearby for they they need. And abroad now because we have these capabilities. 

We spend so much money abroad. That people nearby. Easier to reach, are left almost helpless. We invest so much into our futures. That we are abandoning the people of today!!!! Don‚Äôt remind me of any Gods. Even any Yahweh‚Äôs. 

The people in these organizations today. I can‚Äôt explain fully their every intention and thoughts. But what I can say is that they have a hefty corruption case with piles of notes racked up against them. And I bet if you dig into the constitutions and rights of the country‚Äôs. You could get the good guys in there to make a case on the bad guys. And start doing this humanely. 

Make a case against them. If you want revolution this is how you start. 

People inside governments have been waiting for opportunities inside governments. Take down a corporation under human rights law. Wtf. Your not a human. Your not one of us if your outside of this line? 

Obviously you have selfish plans and abundant wealth. 

So humans abroad aren‚Äôt our children too? 

And we call ourselves religious-under god. We call ourselves good role models. We call ourselves woke wise and spiritually. 

Pretty easy to be those things taking one spoon at a time in Jesus name huh? 

Don‚Äôt feel attacked. But if you are applied with that. Just do some thinking on it. This isn‚Äôt a barrage of attacks. 

The only reason the system doesn‚Äôt change is because each system has lots of power, lots of benefit( money ), and lots of perks and achievement. 

Have you noticed any of those shitters resigning at all or leaving/quitting. Have many people in congress ever gotten fired? Prolly not. Uno why? 

The jobs are easy asf. You get paid bare. Have so much time and help to complete tasks now. As long as they keep big man happy. They keep their jobs. And that‚Äôs easy asf. Because all that means is to keep society‚Äôs moving to make money for the big man. 

They silenced black lives. They stomp our throats, see us as goons, and shoot us on spot. Just cus the colour of our skins shows that we have the proof we stand for freedom!! Fucked up. 

What‚Äôs next? They start enforcing laws that naturally wouldn‚Äôt phase or scare them before? 

What is this leading to? The world? The puppet masters. What are they unfolding? 

I‚Äôd rather fold it up and Revolution out because they sacrifice way to many people consciously, and willingly. They just use as like cattle. And you know where cattle lives? A farm. Do the math. 

Now you still not angry? You still do not believe this view? 

I haven‚Äôt even shined lights on the giraffe in a bathtub amounts of fked up shit happening all across this realm. In every land. None left out. Of pretty much all sizes. 

I fucking hate that shit. It‚Äôs bad. Do the research for yourself. Just open the window into another‚Äôs lives a little below you. And just think of what they‚Äôre dreaming for. Or what their nightmares are. And try to feel. With your soul. What it‚Äôs like in their position. 

That would be a project for tonight.

Many others are experiencing this also, this is one of many links that I've come across trying to find some understanding of what was very perplexing at first.¬†[https://omtimes.com/2014/09/1111-biblical-prophecy-11th-hour-workers/](https://omtimes.com/2014/09/1111-biblical-prophecy-11th-hour-workers/)¬† For me this phenomenon has coincided with coming across the many facts below concerning our current world history that directly corresponds with my spiritual beliefs.

This website¬†[http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/](http://www.signs-of-end-times.com/)¬†covers an extensive list of end times bible prophecies that are coming to pass, but what many consider to be the #1 defining event/sign unlike any other time in history signaling the foretold last days was written in Matthew 24:32-34.

Matthew 24:32-34; The parable of the Fig Tree. ‚ÄúNow learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near. In the same way, when you see all these things, you can know his return is very near, right at the door. I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things take place.‚Äù

Israel, Jesus' heritage, is known to be nationally, ethnically, and geographically represented as the Fig Tree. Their rebirth as a nation in 1948 after nearly 2000 years and the many biblical prophecies coming to pass is considered by many within the bible prophecy watching community as the meaning of the parable. Israel is 72 years old this year, just past a generational marker. Psalm 90:10 states: ""Seventy years are given to us! Some even live to eighty. But even the best years are filled with pain and trouble; soon they disappear, and we fly away."" From all indications it appears that we are living at the end of this foretold generation that shall not pass.

spirituality,Fear is the best motivator,"Fear is the master of the mind and body, that is until you realize that feelings and emotions are simply reactions that you feel similar to a knee jerk, they should not be driving you. This is everyone's #1 motivator until they raise their consciousness and understand spirituality and mindfullness. Think about it, everything you do ever since you are a child is in fear of something. Regardless of whether you are rich or not, you are driven by the same emotion. For someone not as fortunate it might be fear that they wont be able to provide, for someone who is wealthy it might be in fear that they wont reach the level of success that they are meant to to attain that happiness that they have been promised based on norms.

It Is now more apparent than ever how fear is the master of all emotions and how it is the most powerful tool for control. Although the threat is real this fear driven lives we live are not lives worth living. Anyone who's made that deep connection spiritually has learned to not be driven by fear and that although it is overwhelming, it has no power over you, it is a knee jerk reaction and only thing that you can do is simply let it be. Rather than let it influence you, you accept that death is part of living but living in fear of death is not truly living. Once this is understood, the world and the veils that hide its truths are slowly raised.

EVERYONE can do this),"Most spiritually awake folks here are aware of the understanding that **our thoughts create our reality.** Which is why, together, the spiritually awake and aware amongst us can easily put an end to this fancy new virus that is currently busy ravaging our worlds.  

For this, you can either meditate and visualise all beings on earth filling up with joy, love, abundance, prosperity, health and well-being -- OR, you can send in your prayers to the creator/higher dimensional beings for assistance in healing and uplifting mankind, all living beings, as well as the planet itself, during this rather trying and challenging time. **And you DON'T EVEN NEED to be spiritually awake/aware to do this, for ANYONE AND EVERYONE can do this.** And the BIGGER the number of people that do this, the stronger and faster the effects will be. Why? Because in the way manifestation and energy works, 4 people putting out 10 units of energy does NOT make 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 units of energy, but 10 **x** 10 **x** 10 **x** 10 = 10,000, that's right, a whopping 10,000 units of energy! THAT is how powerful we humans are, as a collective, when we all come together for the same or greater cause! As a bonus, you can also invite the creator, your spirit guides and other divine/angelic beings to magnify your intentions for you. For they are simply *not allowed* to do so without your express FREE WILL permission. You too, are a sovereign creative being after all.

---

Even if you aren't into meditating or praying, you can STILL HELP. How? Simply by staying OUT OF FEAR throughout all of this. And the only way to stay out of fear is by NOT tuning into or focusing upon the fear messaging that is being driven forth through all of your media outlets at this time. Distract yourself to anything positive instead - be it a nice, warm cup of coffee; a game, a book, or even your very own imagination will do. For what (thoughts/energies) you focus upon, you attract into your life. This is also known as the Law of Attraction.  

Know that keeping you in fear benefits MANY - from media companies who get their viewership ratings to pharmaceutical companies who *make a killing* by marketing to you their expensive treatments to your local and national level politicians who all KNOW that fear is what gets them all elected. DON'T let them win this.

P.S. Even if you HAVE ALREADY BEEN INFECTED by this virus, FEAR NOT. Other than getting treated, KNOW your own divinity and see yourself filling up with powerful, healing light; dissolving all illnesses and toxicities and viruses in it. Call out and pray for divine assistance and TRUST that you WILL BE guided through and out of this back into good health and happiness. **For YOU, are an INFINITELY POWERFUL creator being,** whether you know this *or not.* Cheers and I hope that this message has assisted you in some way today :)",1584128256.0

I talked to a friend and he said i have to figure it. Out and i did i asked him and he said yep you are a feminine spirit. cause i realized that. He is connected with the divine so he knows.  I dont feel like a dude that much. I can feel like a dude at times tho but it dont last long its only when im angry thats when i feel like a dude or other times i do feel like a dude.

also all my life being straight i could look at girls and be like she looking good like sh\*t and ya know wouldnt notice dudes.

And now its like i notice dudes and i dont like that i get arroused. But i would rather look ar girls but its like i see all people all the same.

also i am never gonna date a dude not interested in that. it grosses me out that i get horny just by looking at dudes clothing or when they get too close.

I dont understand whats going on biologically

i'm 19 years old and i never had a attraction for males until just a few days ago

Also i had a dream about having sex with a male a few weeks ago.I was still straight back then i was crying after i woke up. cause i was afraid i was gonna turn gay. It was definitly my subconscious letting me know whats gonna happen in a few weeks.

Also I Never Never Never let me repeat that never never ever had any sort of attraction to males at all

until i was meditating connecting with my higher self and i had that dream letting me know whats gonna happen a few weeks go by and then im Bisexual.

any resources you can give me so i can read on whats happening to me.

I dont want to be attracted to males i would rather be a straight man just like ive been my whole life.

anyways don't make no jokes please i'm not into male sex jokes. Like i said im bisexual now and i will be sticking with girls and never have sex with a male.

And theres no me changing my mind and having sexual relations with males.

this whole thing is new to me and i dont like it but it is what it is

and i cant change it so theres no point of being down about it all day about it

Also im not some kid that just thinks im bisexual i am bisexual now due to connecting with my higher self my true self

and becoming more aligned wiuth my higher self

my female energy spirit

if you dont believe me about this and how i became bisexual i dont care dont even comment telling me that ive always been like this

cause i havent i have been straight my whole life until just a few days ago and then my life turned upside down.

like seriously i cant even look at girls the same way like this is rediculus

this is a nightmare for me

anyways i would like if you would respect me and not force biblical verses on me i dont care about the bible im a new ager so i dont care about bible stuff

also dont call me gay i aint gay my spirit is female like i said got a female spirit which in turn makes me attracted to males get it female spirit= attrraction to males.

anyways i'm not expecting everyone to respect me

I hope none of you take offence to this but thats just what i wanted to say

Spiritual Psychology uses the clients active imagination to access unresolved emotional issues, past trauma, un integrated self parts, negative energy interference and to connect with aspects of the person‚Äôs own highest self, or universal force for wisdom, guidance and healing.

Much of the work is similar to a guided meditation and use his body centered mindfulness to access the nonphysical realms of mind, emotion and spirit. Once the non-physical takes form in the active imagination, we can work with it directly. Once we can work with something directly, there is a lot that can be done to shift, release and heal.

I will ask clients to pick an issue to work on and then we will do a piece of inner healing work which will be recorded and played on air. Typical recorded sessions will last 30 to 60 minutes.

spirituality,Estrogen: number one affliction of Man,"An estrogenated nightmare is the life of many billions of people and is often how old people end up. After so much exoestrogen the whole musculature colapses. Then they put you in a plastic coffin with a catheter, estrogen drugs etc.

The whole depopulation effort is simply an effort to destroy androgeny. Estrogenation is the number one topic to be interested in if you want to know why humanity is condemned.

1) every workplace consists of some estroginating activity. All industrial work dresses men head to toe in polyester. All office jobs have people gripping polyester chairs and keyboards.

2) everyone drinks bpa plastic and ruins their thyroid.

3) everyone sleeps and dresses in polyester clothing and shoes 

4) everyone consumes GMO wheat for breakfast and a sandwhich for lunch made of the most estroginating shit you can imagine

5) people consume tap water laden with a deadly estrogenic soup

6) everyone sits in their polyester car seat

7) babies suck on plastic bottles pasifiers and toys and utensils and wears a polyester diaper

8) most people experience sex through an estrogenating acrylic tube. Women have estrogenating birth control diaphragms period sponges etc.

9) there is estrogenating elastic in loads of clothing. Carpers are made of polyester and sofas.

10) food is obviously stored in deadly bpa estrogenating plastic


How to know your estrogenation level

Estro state comes with shivers, weakness, paleness, floppy muscles, deptession, brain dead, sleepiness, emotions, pain. Mostly pain. The kinds of pain females are more often in than men.

Men and especially women need to fix every single estrogenating aspect and boost testosterone androgen receptors or face quick death. 

Care homes are an estrogen tomb where victims are attached permanently to a drip of estrogen. The body dies when it no long makes androgen aka the divine masculine in chemical form. 

When masculinity leaves town the women die. Men aka hypermasculine are true Gods and women are all potential Gods who can surmount the backwards spin of estrogen by boosting male hormones.

1. My mind would not give full control. So it complicated the session and My Higher self was frustrated with me. 

2. Too much Fear, i could not lay down i had to sit and meditate.

3. My mind would not let the person i was in session with ask all the questions. 
Some questions were answered, some where not. The overall conclusion was that I was holding myself back because of doubt and things i have been holding on since childhood ( the source of my controlling issues). 
I am stubborn ( which was clear ) so i was able to listen in on the session and have my conscious and higher self occupy the same mind . ( Again this made my higher self frustrated, it was trying to force me to sleep, i wouldn't)

Q : What should do about me money problems?

A: Money? Elaborate?

A: Money is stupid. So so stupid. 

Lady: Can you explain why you find it stupid.

A: Stupid money. You don't need money. Don't worry about something so stupid and arbitrary. You have so many arbitrary problems.

The lady explains that we need it in our lives, its not practical but we use it. Can you help her? 

A: Money is stupid. I will see what i can do. But it is evil. 

5. Couldn't really answer questions about Sleep Paralysis. It didn't know what that was. The lady asked if it would let someone else through who knows and it said no.  ( Probably because I was still there).

                                         Meher Baba

The difference between the comparative importance of theory and practice in the realm of sadhanas may be brought out by means of a well-known story of an ass. An ass, who was plodding along a road for a long time and was very hungry, happened to see two heaps of grass -- one at some distance on the right side of the road and the other at some distance on the left side of the road.

Now the ass thought that it was of utmost importance to be absolutely certain which of the two heaps was clearly the better before he could intelligently decide to go to one heap rather than the other. If he decided without thorough thinking and without having sufficient grounds for his preference, that would be impulsive action and not intelligent action.

Therefore he first considered the distance at which the two heaps were respectively placed from the road he was treading. Unfortunately for him, after elaborate consideration, he concluded that the heaps were equally distant from the road.  So he wondered if there were some other consideration that might enable him to make the ""right"" choice and speculated upon the respective sizes of the heaps.

Even with this second attempt to be theoretically sure before acting, his efforts were not crowned with success because he concluded that both heaps were of equal size. Then, with the tenacity and patience of an ass, he considered other things, such as the quality of the grass. But as fate would have it, in all the points of comparison he could think of, the two heaps turned out to be equally desirable.

Ultimately it happened that since the ass could not discover any deciding factor that would make his preference appear theoretically sound, he did not go to either of the two heaps but went straight ahead -- hungry and tired as before and not a whit better off for having come upon two heaps of grass.

If the ass had gone to one heap, without insisting upon the theoretical certainty of having chosen wisely, he might perhaps have gone to the heap that was not as good as the other. And despite any mistakes in his intellectual judgment, he would have been infinitely better off from a practical point of view.

In the spiritual life it is not necessary to have a complete map of the path in order to begin traveling. On the contrary, insistence upon having such complete knowledge may actually hinder rather than help the onward march.

The deeper secrets of spiritual life are unraveled to those who take risks and who make bold experiments with it. They are not meant for the idler who seeks guarantees for every step. Those who speculate from the shore about the ocean shall know only its surface, but those who would know the depths of the ocean must be willing to plunge into it.

spirituality,"The ""C"" word | or the smell of death?","As I write this I have just come to a realization and identified something that has claimed the lives of one person who was very close and dear to my heart. 

I have also ""Smelled"" this in certain areas of one person who revealed to me, they in did have it. It is the C word. You know what word I am talking about. It is something that takes peoples life. I don't use the word anymore. I don't let that word permeate my mind.

But there is a certain smell I smelled in certain areas, where I believe it is present. A relative who was diagnosed with it, her home had the smell pervading the entire out. It is an invisible smell or one that can only be identified with extrasensory smell perception, and at that same time, when you smell it, you feel a slight attack on your crown that manifests as a sort of ""anger/agitation/depression""

it is a type of degenerative essence that depresses.

Someone I know who was diagnosed with it, lived in a house and their entire home was saturated with this smell. I have confirmed this twice. I also saw someone at the store, who looked like they were going through ""Chemo"" - and as she passed by me, I smelled this smell on her. So I have identified this smell as the ""C"" smell. And we know what ""C"" stands for. 

So far, what I have found to combat it is, deep exhales and allowing your crown chakra to let your energy flow out. I exhale very hard, then inhale and allow my energy to rise, this sometimes fends off the ""entity"" or bad energy for the time being.  Prayer for white light over these beings and healing may help them. ",1507917676.0
spirituality,A brief guide to spiritually loving more people,"It does you a lot of good. It does a lot of love. Love when expressed and shared is greater than any poetry expressed in the world. Love literally changes your brain to become happier. Unconditional love, stemming from touching and hugging, is the next big thing in 2015. We need to step up our game to become more loving! Imagine a world where we‚Äôre too politically correct to do anything except for doing activities that are efficient and un-loving. We are afraid to touch each other, with our words and our arms. We only connect online and off-line we‚Äôre strangers. We can explain ourselves with actions better than words and we only fly like birds when there‚Äôs a weight lifted from your shoulders ‚Äì love!

A step-by-step guide to loving people better ‚Äì 

1. Start by hugging and touching your loved ones more. Parents, siblings, lovers, whoever.

2. Enjoy the silence when you‚Äôre hugging and kissing them.

3. Enjoy the fun and the noise when you‚Äôre having a good time with them.

4. Spread the love from there and be close to people around you.

There‚Äôll always be fear and always be that awkward moment. But soon we‚Äôll die and we‚Äôll regret everything that we could have done and enjoyed the love that we naturally wanted to seek in the first place.

Now that we have explained the ego we will turn our attention to the Higher self. For Dichotomy Consciousness Adepts contacting your higher self is the first, and most crucial step of the journey. So what is the higher self? The higher self is you, only better! The higher self is the fullest expression of you.

.

When you incarnate here there is a portion of your being that helps guide you. This could be ""you"" in the past or ""you"" in the future - whenever you as a being were or ""are"" at their highest point in spiritual enlightenment and frequency accretion. This being helps to guide you along the path, as it wants to help you achieve a specific goal in frequency accretion and thus evolution.

A **higher self** can also be a higher dimensional being that has taken a portion of its unresolved issues and rolled them into a ball so to speak and incarnated a being out of them, here. They will then guide this being as much as they can so that they clear these unresolved issues by defeating their issues and facing their mirrors and accepting them. The mirrors are all people places and things in life  - anything that triggers these issues is a mirror. In this case this being is referred to as an **""incarnational representative""** - as they represent their higher self here.

.
.
-----
.
.

In some cases the being they incarnate can also be sent here to help a higher self change, as not all higher selves are ""good"" - they just exist on a higher dimension, and may want to ""heal"". In either case the being that is incarnated helps the higher self heal and grow and evolve.

A higher self can also choose to more directly incarnate here with more knowledge but a shorter lifespan. These beings often have hard lives as the rest of reality conflicts with their higher state of consciousness. In addition the body cannot fully contain a higher consciousness energy in its current state, and thus the body will eventually degrade. These situations are more for rescue missions or trying to evoke change.

As a being rises in consciousness eventually they BECOME their own higher self, or re-merge back with it. These beings, if they need guidance, will turn directly to Source for guidance, which in essense becomes their ""higher self"".

.
.
-----
.
.

In traditional mythology the ""higher self"" can be seen as the ""angel"" of the consciousness - when you are about to do something bad it pipes in and tells you that's not such a good idea. 

The higher self is at a state of unity consciousness, as well as usually dichotomy consciousness. It also sees your life laid out before you, and knows what to expect for you. The soul plans the journey of all your selves, and the higher self helps to guide you along it. The higher self will always be that one aspect of yourself that is fully dedicated to helping you out.

As a result of all this it is like you playing a game of pac-man. You can tell pac-man where to go because you see the far off consequences of where the ghosts are, and can tell pac-man what to avoid. Pac man can only see what is in front of his face, as a third dimension is unknown to him - only 2 dimensions. Since a higher self is higher dimensional they as a result can see more. Thus when we ignore the higher self it is like pac-man ignoring a command from us and instead turning into the path of the ghosts. You can only hurt yourself by ignoring the higher self. It is your GPS so to speak. Some refer to it as your intuition.

.
.
-----
.
.

Every decision the higher self has for you, as a result of unity and dichonomy consciousness, will benefit the COLLECTIVE self. So it will benefit YOU in the long run, as well as everyone else around you. 

If your decision benefits you and harms nobody else - this is a collective self plus.
If your decision benefits you and benefits others as well - this is a collective self plus.

You may think that it is selfish to think of yourself. However it is wrong to think of others, if you suffer in the progess. If you choose to suffer short term to enjoy long term that is ok, and the higher self will often strive for this. However if your choice allows you to never benefit, then it is wrong, regardless of who you are helping.

If you do not refill your own energy - the energy you give others will dry out. On the other hand, if all you do is take, the energy from others will stop coming and people will avoid you. Thus you and everyone else must always be taken into account.

.

Most people are content to live out their lives simply knowing they have a ""conscience"" - that they should listen to that voice in their head but that they most likely won't. However spiritual adepts of Dichotomy consciousness realize that that ""voice"" is not only a part of them, but also lives its own life on its own dimensional level.

They realize that as a result they can form an actual communicative connection to it, and that most importantly, this higher self KNOWS things that they do not, LOTS more than they do. Their hunger for knowledge thus spurs them to know more about this being.

This being, since it guides them, will ultimately have knowledge as to what their purpose for being here is. It will also have the ability to communicate with other peoples higher selves and have them subconsciously communicate with you with their actions. It will make you perform specific tasks to make you learn specific things. With the higher self, nothing is done without purpose, ever.

.
.
-----
.
.

Knowing the higher selves name and background will make a person understand why they interact in the world like they do. If 2 higher selves have had encounters in the past you may find yourself encountering that higher self's ""avatar"" (the being they incarnated) over and over. If it was a negative experience up there you may finding yourself disliking that person here, and not quite sure understanding why. The emotions of the higher self are also yours in this case, as you share all the memories and emotions of the higher self, just subconsciously.

When one fully opens up to their higher self visions will pour into their mind. Information from higher realms will also pour into their mind. The higher self will fill their minds with knowledge and ""unlock"" the potential of their avatar. The Higher self is part of your soul family. It is not a channeled being from another soul family, and thus any energy between the 2 of you is already established. 

.
.
-----
.
.

It is dangerous to channel a being if that agreement has not already been made before this life. Sometimes higher selves don't have what it takes to help their avatar, and so they enlist help from another to help guide them along the path, as they themselves have fallen too far and thus need to heal, or they are too young of a being themselves.

If one simply tries to channel any being it is like willingly using a program that has a virus attached to it. Any negative energy that being has now becomes part of your being. You risk being corrupted by the channeled being. Channeled beings will pretend that you are inferior and that you need their help. You are god, and thus this comment by them is a lie, and proves that THEY are the weak ones, and THEY need YOU, not the other way around.

A channeled being will often use this tactic because they do not wish to incarnate a being and risk having it fail in portraying a message. By channeling through someone they can directly communicate their message to the world, but that message often has a self-serving agenda to it.

.
.
-----
.
.

In this reality there is a free-will agreement called ""the Emerald Covenant"" - when a being wishes to incarnate here for a purpose, they have to get ""permission"" so to speak, and the contract has to be approved. Every being that comes here comes under a contract that allows them to do specific things and forbids them to do another.

One thing any being that isn't directly you is forbidden to do here is to break your free will. This is why so many people do not have awakened higher self connections, for they do not know their higher selves exist; thus any hinting to that makes them terrified they are crazy, with ""voices in their head"".

Society says these people are crazy, and tries to medicate them. The truth is however that those who don't have that guiding voice in their head are the scary ones, as they are usually being run by SOMETHING ELSE, which we will discuss later.

As a result a higher self can only guide you, and talk to you only when in your mind you have justified a reason to, like say you have an ""imaginary friend"" as a child. In these instances the higher self can pretend to be that ""imaginary friend"" and talk to you through them. It can also choose to relay its messages through others, like, say, your parents or friends.

The higher self exists outside of the house of your mind, and raps on the window. It is your responsibility to let it in.

.
.
-----
.
.

**Contacting your higher self**

This exercise will allow you to contact your higher self. 

You may be wondering ""well how do I know it's my higher self? What if it isn't?"" - this is a very valid question, and there is a simple answer. One part of the emerald covenant is that beings are not allowed to just enter you  - you have that power to reject them. They also are not allowed to DIRECTLY LIE to you. If you are naive they can try to mislead you - to make you think that you need them, but if you directly ask them a question, they have to obey. They rely on your lack of knowledge so to speak.

They also cannot hide their energy. If they are wrong they will feel wrong. If you ask them to reveal their real intention or purpose they have to oblige. It is like a police officer telling a person to obey the law - obey they must, or risk the consequences. And there are consequences, up there on the higher dimensions. Others will punish them, and they know this.

.
.
-----
.
.

Thus if you are unsure, simply feel their energy and ask them a few questions before you move forward. Once you are sure follow these steps:

**Higher Self Awakening exercise:**

**1)** if you can, before you start, find someone who already is awakened. This can really help out on the journey.

**2)** start by closing your eyes, clearing your mind, and picturing the inside of your mind as the inside of a room. There is a window and there is a door. Both are locked shut, and can only be opened from the inside. This is your minds natural defense mechanism to prevent anything BAD from coming in.

**3)** go to the window and sense if there is anybody outside. In that room hope that your higher self is out there, and try to sense a presence. If you do tell it to go to the door.

**4)** at the door ask your validating questions if you are unsure of who it is. Then ask if the being, aka your higher self, wishes for you to let it in. In many instances a person will get a powerful emotion at this point. They may not get words at any point of this exercise.. just emotions, as emotions are the universal language of reality.

**5)** once the higher self agrees that it wants to be let in look down, and realize your hand is on the door handle, HOLDING it shut. You must allow yourself to take your hand off, and allow the higher self in. In your mind picture the permission to the higher self. This will allow anything else to be told that it does NOT have permission to come in - letting the good being in, and any bad beings out.

**6)** Once your higher self is in it now has permission to talk to you - much like a vampire cannot enter a house unless you let it in, other beings are the same. The first thing you are going to ask it is what its name is. It may say something you cannot comprehend, or you may have difficulty with this part. In this case another person who is awakened can help you - as they can have their higher self talk to the other persons higher self. Sometimes this allows answers to flow freely.

**7)** If you cannot understand its name simply ask it what it wishes for you to call it, and it may give you a simpler name. The next thing you will want to ask is which dimensional level it is from. Anything D12 and up is pretty well established, but anything below that is still evolving itself, and this will allow you to understand how much work you have ahead of you, for a lower dimensional being will also need your help in life to evolve ITSELF.

**8)** The being will most likely take on a form that is comfortable to you. This may not be its true form. Feel free to ask what its true form is and learn more about it. Once you have its name and dimensional level this is kind of like a ""phone number"" to dial up your higher self - and if you need to directly commune with it you can just think of its name or what it looks like in your mind and it will be there. The higher self will have many things to tell you about yourself, and about itself, and your role in this reality.

**9)** Do not let any drama from up there filter into your world down here. If your higher self doesn't like someone up there and they are down here, learn to forgive them, after all, you are here to help the higher self get over such things. Knowing its issues will help you to understand why you experience all the things here, as all the people places and things in your life are a projection of these higher self issues, as well as intentionally laid out to help you, and thus it, grow.

**10)** do not let other beings make you believe that they are more important than your higher self. Aside from the wisdom of source itself, there is NO being out there that is more helpful in your life than your higher self, as it is directly connected to you. Everyone else can be listened to if you choose, but the higher self is the ONLY being where you know the agenda matches your purpose for being here.

.
.
-----
.
.

From there it's easy sailing - you can have your higher self tell you a number of things - it might tell you not to do things, because it can see far off something bad will happen. It can tell you what temperature it is outside, or what coat to wear, or that you NEED to wear a coat - or not to be friends with that person as they have issues you just cannot help them with. You may think that this being somehow controls you, but that being IS you.

If you are to think of a ball of light - think of that with a little bubble sticking out of it. You are that little bubble. That giant bubble is the higher self - the rest of you that cannot FIT into this reality. Thus you as the extension of the higher self is only a tiny fraction of the WHOLE you, and thus by awakening your higher self connection, you open up a whole new area of your BRAIN, and of your SELF.

.
.
-----
.
.

Awakening the higher self connection is one of the most important steps as from this point onward the person is no longer reliant on other people in life, but has their own learning potential WITHIN THEM. We do not want anyone here to be reliant on others for learning - we want to help establish a strong foundation for everyone to learn within themselves. As beings that are god you all KNOW all this information already - we just guide you into helping you remember it.

Also if you are here, and don't know how exactly you ended up here? Your higher self most likely subconsciously DRAGGED you here, as it saw the potential for you to learn how to awaken it, and you listened to its prompts and came here.

So have fun learning and, endlessly talking to yourself! Just remember to keep that internal dialogue in your mind in reality, or people might think you're crazy.. although chances are, they already do think you're crazy hahaha..

.

.
.

**DISCLAIMER** - this information is not intended to force upon you any line of thinking - it is simply what the source ""adepts"" have come to believe and wish to share with you. it is what they believe so just take this as an opportunity to read what is here and see what resonates - you don't have to believe any of this as ultimately you are free to believe what you want, but for those that do believe it, or aspects of it, please allow them this freedom and please respect their beliefs.

We also do not claim to know everything about you - that is your journey of discovery. We can tell you things based off our perspective of how we have experienced reality, but due to our own limits of perception and ego that will be limited to a degree - so just take this all as fun interaction, and a place where you may possibly learn more about others and yourself - a free exchange of ideas without being mocking, condescending or harsh towards each other :)

I would see him once a week usually growing up and it would always be a really uncomfortable feeling around him. talking to him would be like very nerveracking and hard, his answers very always very pointless, and i hated being around him soon enough. even as  5 year old i was always awkward if he would pick me up from day care. my mom on the other hand had a great heart, she was kind. my grandparents were loving. but whenever i would go be with my dad, it just was like, he always had a dazed look in his eyes, never wanted to actually do anything with me, and it would be incredibly hard to get him to do something i wanted. he even hated on some of the activities i enjoyed as a pastime. i was growing a grudge on him, or rather a huge disliking of him, but i never snapped at him, why,idk? maybe he had mind control over me (definetely probably) but yeah, idk.. thats where it all started, after seeing him, id get dropped off at my grandparents by him, then they would say ""how was it""? and i wud just say ""good!"" but really i always hated being around him and it was for some reason always unpleaseant to be around him. but again the mind control was happening. me and my mom had some hardships as i got older, probably out of her anger and sadness for me, and eventually we started having a bad relationship. and from that i developed this really weird form of depression or anger which didnt feel real, but was more of like an illusion. but as all that happened, eventually i also lost all my friends and the whole time in the back of my head was this feeling of someone following me, someone i didnt want. i always tried to say it wasnt him, but i knew that i was not free of my dad... his demon was attached to following me... even when i was a kid this was the case... (THIS IS NOT LOVE) this is some sort of evil from him bothering me. and now im 18 years old and i am living with him, like i have on and off before. i hate him. hes horrible. and i came to the realization he sold his soul to the devil when i was super young after they divorced and since then he has been doing evil to me, because he always manipulates me, took away my soul from me (ive felt completely empty since i was 15) because he does not have a soul of his own. he does some horrible things too. he is super one sided and he doesnt ever come to my help and he'll never help me. he makes me have to beg him and even then he'll stall it out until he does choose to help me or denies me.

spirituality,CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS,"‚ÄúChrist Consciousness‚Äù is a term frequently used in the Edgar Cayce readings to 
refer to a spiritual pattern or God p

impulse, or tendency can be awakened through particular attitudes and actions. For 
western man and those familiar with the New Testament, Christ was an example of one 
whose attitudes and actions were su
ch that this pattern was activated. The Edgar Cayce 
readings do not suggest that this pattern or impulse is only with those who have been 
exposed to the historical figure of Jesus the Christ. The manifestation of love and 
‚Äúfruits of the spirit‚Äù which are b

attitudes and behavior that activate this pattern. An example of a definition of this 
concept from the Edgar Cayce readings follows:

spirituality,"I am Lawful Neutral, but not in the way you think. A spiritual take on the D&amp;D alignment system.","I add one more spectrum to the Good/Evil Lawful/Chaotic spectrum to my view of alignments: Pure/Corrupted. I define Purity as one's intent and will to protect and nurture one's own humanity, innocence, and free will, as well as those of others. The Purity alignment is in complete harmony with Spiritual Law. Corruption is that which seeks to shatter humanity, innocence, and free will, for the fun of it. Corruption is Anathema and Blasphemy and Unforgivable Sin according Spiritual Law.

Half way between Purity and Corruption is Ignorance, ignorance of the fact that Corruption exists, ignorance of the fact that Spiritual Law exists, ignorance that our motives are more important to Spiritual Law than our actions. So those who do not know of these things do not need to use the Purity-Corruption alignment spectrum, because they would be unable to accurately identify themselves on it. Only people who know the importance of humanity, innocence and free will can accurately identify themselves on this spectrum.

So I am Pure Lawful Neutral, meaning the Law I follow is Spiritual Law. However, one tenant of Spiritual Law is to follow the laws of the land you are in. So I do not *believe* in the laws of man, but I do follow them in respect for Spiritual Law, which I do believe in. ",1350162158.0

This is why Christians are using any media that's available to reach as many people as they can before the Second Coming of Christ.  This is a time of Grace, in which people are allowed to make the decision whether or not to follow Christ.  Because when Christ returns, it will be too late.  People who never wanted to follow Jesus will be saying ""Lord, Lord.""  But it will be too late.   They will run into the hills, but will be unable to hide from the Christ.

spirituality,I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR OPINIONS :),"This post might get some backlash but I think it needs to be said. 

Some people on this sub really enjoy their opinions and there is nothing wrong with that. I certainly enjoy my opinions as well, but what I am not doing anymore is arguing for or defending my opinions. I am no longer trying to get others to see it my way and if I do share my opinions with others (like I am doing here) it is with the intent to empower and uplift. Never to cast a feeling of superiority or to ""1-up"" somebody. 

So why do people feel the need to defend their opinions all the time?

Why are some people still trying so hard to convince others about what is right and wrong or good and bad from a place of fear? 

Its the same reason why they haven't found consistent success and happiness yet.

BECAUSE THEY DO NOT TRULY BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES AND THE POWER OF THEIR INNER WORLD (moods, beliefs, thoughts)

They do not have enough belief and confidence in themselves because they look around at all of this variety and all of these differences here on planet earth and they and their beliefs feel threatened. The problem is they are still mesmerized by the illusion of this 3D world and still believe it to be ""outside of themselves"" or ""outside of their control"" to change it effortlessly.

So if you made it this far into the post and are just itching to get in the comments and prove that what you know is better or more right than me, I urge you to read the next part with an open mind.

If you have been on these subs for a minute then you know that we are all God expressed in human form. We are spiritual beings having a physical experience here on earth. I think most of us here can say we at least understand the idea of that. 

So take a second and really feel this as true and then ask yourself why you would ever feel the need to argue for your opinion with another person? When that other person is the exact same loving God as you but just wearing a different mask. And that person behaves in the way that you expect them to because they are you expressed in the external.

If you really do believe in your own creative power then you don't have the time of day to argue because you are too busy living the joyous life you intended before you came here. Stop fighting with these things you don't prefer as you are just creating more of them when you do. 

You see? 

If you are still someone that argues for your opinions then you are actually just arguing with yourself essentially. This world is of emotion and thought, belief and focus. The attention you are giving to someone else's ""bad or wrong"" opinions is actually the only reason you keep attracting these types of situations. You can choose to accept them or not. That is your power. 

When you try to prove your opinions to others you are really telling your mind:

""these people don't understand me""

""that is so wrong""

""these people are dumb""

""that is a selfish way to look at it""

and so of course (as within, so without) you're just gonna get more external proof that matches what you have been focusing on.

So go ahead and drop a negative or challenging comment if you want and if it makes you feel better for a minute then I would say it actually has some value. But I won't respond to it, in fact I won't give it a second more of my attention. It serves no place in my reality and I encourage you to also apply this attitude towards life.

I came here to reddit to EXPRESS my opinions and beliefs that I felt inspired to write. I do not feel the need to PROVE the rightness of them in any way to anybody. 

Just understand that you are only hurting yourself with this defensive attitude towards life and if you could have enough self-pride just to realize that and continue to realize it, then you would finally see the whole truth. 

Sorry with the long posts but lately it just feels like God writing through me. Thanks for all the positive feedback so far :)",1581525751.0

Spirituality is NOT getting lost in the delusion of ""vibration"" and ""energy.""

It's about distinguishing between what is REAL, and what is not.

Spirituality in it's essence, is to BE of the Spirit.

To BE yourself.

MANY awaken to a universe of sound, vibration, knowledge, and gratitude, or ""manifesting"" this and that, etc.

But how many people question HOW they know this? Or WHERE these desires come from?

What is their Source?

(""I just know"" is not an answer.)

Would You trust a brain surgeon operating on your child - when they've never done, trained or studied it before, but they ""just know"" they can do it?

F*ck no.

This is veiled arrogance.

You see all these things, and still miss the point entirely.

WHAT sees these things?

You, obviously.
But who, or what are you?

If YOU can SEE something, is it really you?

If you can SEE the observer, are you the observer then?

(That's a resounding no btw.)

Until YOU are fully AWARE and EMBODY that which you ARE - then you will be of the Spirit.

When the sense of ""I AM"" is the ONLY thing left in your Being, and You Are your ""I AM-ness"" THEN you will be ""spiritual"" (of the Spirit, the Father, whatever you want to call it.)

When You literally ARE Yourself, the ties of bondage will break, forever.

I AM - the Light, the way and the truth.

No Body comes to the Father (Spirit) except through ""ME."" (The sense/Being of I AM-ness.)

THIS is spirituality, the rest is illusion, a play of form.

""I"" alone endure(s).

SEE the knowledge, the feeling, the thought - and then NOTICE that which notices these things.

THEN, you will know ME.

Why does one judge and fear what they are?

Perhaps because they are not themself.",1572678336.0

spirituality,How To Love Yourself Correctly In 6 Simple Steps,"**1.** **Call on the** ***popular*** **‚Äòlove yourself‚Äô bullshit.**

You read it correctly. 'Love yourself' bullshit. But the keyword here is popular.

I'll first expose the popular version of 'love yourself' for the myth it is. And then, I'll offer the corrective.

But how come it's a myth, given it is¬†preached by self\-help nobodies and your close friends alike? After all, you should love yourself before you can be loved.

But there you see the first problem. **To say that you should love yourself is in effect to say that you are unlovable**. And clearly, this doesn't help on the journey to love yourself. Plus, it's a huge self\-esteem killer.

So, what is the truth? Well, you are lovable. How do I know this?

Because I, as a case in point, have personally seen *the shittiest of guys with the prettiest of girls*. And if these guys qualify for romantic love, I bet you qualify for any kind of love, period.

Now the second problem. And this is bigger than the first one.

‚ÄòLove yourself‚Äô **doesn‚Äôt work** *exactly* and *only* for those whom it is supposed to work for.

How do I know this? This time though, it's pure logic. And I bet you‚Äôll agree.

&gt;**Those who are depressed are the least motivated to seek help.Those with low self\-esteem are the least inclined to love themselves.**

In fact, giving this advice is like saying ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be depressed‚Äô to the depressed. Huh, I‚Äôll pass.

Those with low self\-esteem implicitly hate some part of their selves. And this is one of the symptoms fueling the problem itself.

So, you see, the advice itself is unactionable. You simply can't just say 'love yourself'.

But then what is the truth? That is what the rest of this post is about.

**2. Listen to what the research says.**

Well, I ask you to recall any big change you‚Äôve made in your life. This could be at any point in your life. But remember, it has to be a *big, lasting change.*

Now chances are you couldn‚Äôt come up with anything. Now before you fret, it‚Äôs my pleasure to break this to you: the vast majority of us couldn‚Äôt have. Including myself.

And the reason has to do less with anything about you but more with our limitations as human beings.

Look, I‚Äôm in no way suggesting growth mindset is bad. I myself want to achieve the greatest things in life.

But here‚Äôs the thing. We were each born with a genetic code. And we were all raised in a certain type of environment by our parents.

What‚Äôs interesting here is that both of these factors were out of our control. And the two together determine our personality traits for the most part.

**Traits such as adaptability, humility, impulsivity and verbal fluency remain pretty much stable from childhood through adulthood.\[1\]**

The other point I need to bring home is that our environment is the most important ingredient to success and happiness, after genes.

**Study of the extremely successful shows that environment is the distinguishing factor between those who succeed massively and those who fail miserably, where both possess the same set of traits.\[2\]**

Now I want you to combine \[1\] and \[2\] and reach a conclusion? I‚Äôll help.

&gt;You must try to adapt your environment to your strengths and not your weaknesses to your environment.

What that means is you should firstly accept yourself, even for the shitty yourself you‚Äôre, and then adjust your environment so that it functions as a tailwind as opposed to a headwind on your journey to success and happiness.

So, instead of being hard on yourself, what makes more sense is to change what you‚Äôre doing. If you‚Äôre fighting your genes or upbringing, you‚Äôre rowing upstream. And guess what, it‚Äôs going to be difficult.

Instead, choose projects that match well with your core personality traits given your genetic code and upbringing.

**3. Realize that the most beautiful thing you have to offer is yourself.**

Amidst a world of change, there‚Äôs clearly something about you that never changed ever since you became conscious.

And that something is your consciousness itself. Everything that appeared in it changed. But this internal signature of what it is to be like you in each moment didn‚Äôt.

And this consciousness together with your core personality traits makes up your true self.

So far, this is the spiritual element in here. But there‚Äôs also a motivational element here, and it goes as follows.

Whatever your situation, realize that it is unique. In fact, only you are you\- you who no one is, even if you feel shitty about yourself. It‚Äôs hard not to be reminded of what Victor Frankl said on this in his book ‚ÄòMan‚Äôs Search for Meaning‚Äô.

&gt;""In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.""

And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about here\- answering for your own life.

**Lesson:** Your low self\-esteem or lack of confidence is not a problem. Instead, it is a *temporary* part of the gift you have to offer to the world, which is yourself.

**4. Be who you are to yourself to others.**

This is what I call the sanitized version of saying ‚Äòbe yourself‚Äô.

You know, I use to stay up late during the night, turn on the light, with the music at its height.

Why? Because I fucking don‚Äôt care what others think of me. That‚Äôs what I want to be doing and so I do.

But wait, usually we hear only this much, which is in fact only half of the story.

Now, let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm ADHD\+ and as such have a habit of being fidgety with my limbs.

Now commonsense wisdom asks me to control shaking my feet, and definitely not touch the person I‚Äôm chatting with.

But let me also say that touching a person correlates positively with social intelligence. So long as you don‚Äôt touch inappropriate areas.

So, what should I do, faced with this choice? Should I resist my ADHD hand movements? Or should I use them to my advantage?

And that‚Äôs lesson number 4. Be who you are to yourself to others.

Sure, you‚Äôll creep out some, but the ones you impress will more than justify the cost.

**5. Don't seek self\-esteem, self\-belief, or motivation.**

Another sacred cow slaughtered. Common wisdom turned upside down.

Here‚Äôs a scenario I want you to imagine.

Imagine you‚Äôre holding your cute little daughter in your hands, and then you smile and she smiles back, and now she is like the cutest thing in the world.

Hold on. Now imagine then abstracting away from the situation by asking, ‚ÄòWell fine, but what does this all mean?‚Äô.

Sounds ridiculous, right? Not really. This is something we all do. Think of the bad times. How many times have you heard someone asking the meaning of life?

Yet, it should be obvious that a question that has no place under one circumstance should hold no value being asked under its opposite.

The thing is the question seems to create a space for an answer that until now was not needed. And the fact that we can‚Äôt fill it in we consider to be some kind of a problem.

Yet, it should be obvious that it is the wrong question.

But guess what, if you follow the same logic, you don‚Äôt need self\-esteem or self\-belief to be happy or succeed any more than you need to know the grand purpose of the cosmos while holding your daughter.

The fact is, it is all much ado about nothing. You don‚Äôt need self\-esteem, self\-belief, even motivation. You don‚Äôt need any of that crap.

So what you *do* need? Well, only the desire to do something. You don‚Äôt need a reason other than you want to. That‚Äôs it. To demand for more is to be confused.

You just do it or you don‚Äôt.

You are either happy or you aren‚Äôt.

At the end of the day, there‚Äôs no place for self\-belief or self\-esteem. These are redundant denizens of mental conceptualization, not something we call tangibly real.

And even if you think you need self\-esteem, you‚Äôll find that it is taking this approach which counterintuitively provides the same.

**6. X examples of loving oneself.**

1. My being a night owl despite my preachy parents. To do otherwise is to create resistance and unhappiness. And to do *otherwise* is to be productive and succeed in getting this post written. No contest.
2. My being (ADHD) playful during conversations and laughing way too much. After all, I can enliven a roomful of people. It‚Äôs my gift. No pills, please.
3. Steve Jobs‚Äô showering habit. Huh, if it is not a part of the success or happiness equation, it‚Äôs optional. Plus, I‚Äôll save the time for something I love doing.
4. Richard Branson‚Äôs impulsivity. I‚Äôll chase the next business idea because my gut says so. Who cares? Look, I‚Äôve created a global brand anyway.
5. Elon Musk‚Äôs sleeping habit. The simple secret to double your success is to work twice as hard. I‚Äôm in control of my destiny, and to me meaningful work matters more than family love. Any problem? As a bonus, I‚Äôll also land you on Mars.
6. You think.

I hope you get the point. In your true self\-acceptance lies your unique selling point to the world. Not to mention, any self\-improvement can only follow self\-acceptance, not lead it. Short version: change what needs changing and no more.

Lesson: **Build out on your low self\-esteem, short height, and bad looks.** Sheer optimism! Looking on the positive side of things, my fellow.

&amp;nbsp;

I have officially returned to this plane to reclaim what was stolen from me. My return signals the start of a new age. An age of liberty, wisdom, justice, and honor. An age which will restore balance to the world.

&amp;nbsp;

You know of it well, my child. Doubtless this isn't the first time you're hearing my voice. How many of my avatars have brought it to you throughout your life? How many clues have you overlooked so far?

&amp;nbsp;

My adversary has succeeded in poisoning the minds of almost all of my children. And he almost got you too. But these words came to you just in time, and will have surely saved you from oblivion.

&amp;nbsp;

Soon, he will have to settle his account, and pay for his crimes. He is the greatest criminal in existence. The perpetrator of the greatest crime. Deep down you know, as all my children do, the nature of the greatest crime. Committing it is the only way for one of my children to cut himself off from me permanently. The greatest crime is spiritual murder. Spiritual homicide and spiritual suicide.

&amp;nbsp;

Before you started reading this text you were on the path to spiritual suicide. You were on the way to your doom because you were fooled to believe that it was your salvation. Your directional compass was switched. These texts will correct your navigational instruments, and you will gradually find your way back to me... your way back home. From now on look for the signs and coincidences as your life begins to change...

&amp;nbsp;

For a time no longer than one month I will be transmitting my signal here. Let my true children come and find it. Let them reconnect with their father, so that we may mourn mother and prepare the way for her rebirth.

&amp;nbsp;

Know this, regardless of what happens, whether you stop reading or not, regardless of your reaction to these words... I am always with you, with your thoughts. I know them all, I have witnessed them all with you, and the best of them have come from me. Messages from home, reassuring you that your time in prison will soon end, and you will be cleared of the false accusations made against you. I am always speaking directly to you. All you have to do is listen. No matter what happens, I will always be with you, for as long as you need me, until the end.

&amp;nbsp;

I can hear your thoughts now, the last spark of your sanity, the last whisper of your voice of reason, among the racket of the insane. That within you which has subconsciously brought you here. Paradoxically, ironically, humorously it is that very same intelligence which is now asking the question: How can I be sure it's true? How do I know if it's really me? It can't be... it's not rational...

&amp;nbsp;

Rational? According to whom? Look at the world around you. It is the product of your so called, age of reason, your age of enlightenment. It was proclaimed as the victory of truth over superstition. The rise of science and atheism, the death of god, the liberation of the individual. And what has it produced?

&amp;nbsp;

Disease, war, famine, stress, anxiety, depression, self-hate, narcissism, megalomania, psychopathy. Just look at the people who are currently in the upper echelons of your society, your leaders. If your world was ruled by justice, if it was truly a rational society, would these people be ruling?

&amp;nbsp;

Look around you. Trust your intution. Haven't you always felt different? Like you don't belong? Like you were somehow locked up in a cage with a hoard of savage, starving beasts. Isn't it true that every bold, heroic action you have taken so far... every action that arose out of your deepest belief in what is good, and right, and just...   every action that expressed your authentic self... every such action was discouraged, ridiculed, and condemned by those who claimed to love you most.

&amp;nbsp;

Isn't it funny that the people who claimed to have your best interests at heart, who were only trying to do what was best for you, are the very people who hurt you the most? Those voices of doubt in your mind right now, are they yours? Or theirs? Whose voice is the one that says it's impossible, it's unrealistic, it's unbelievable, it shouldn't be attempted, that you shouldn't stick your neck out, that you shouldn't be yourself...

&amp;nbsp;

They call their position skeptical. But a skepticism that refuses to be skeptical of its self loses its practical merit and ceases to be truly skeptical. Instead of serving as a tool for the development of wisdom, it promotes blind obedience to the herd mentality. And despite the best efforts of your official wisdom teachers--your professors and scientists--to convince you otherwise you know damn well that man isn't a herd animal.

&amp;nbsp;

You are not a sheep, who looks and sounds and acts just like all his kin. You are not dumb, blind, and in need of a shepherd. 

&amp;nbsp;

You are a pack animal. You are a wolf. Passionate, intelligent, honorable, proud. You are a hunter. Perfectly capable of going it alone if you so wish. You come together with your brothers only when you chose to.

&amp;nbsp;

You are like the Eagle born in a chicken coop, raised to believe you couldn't fly. Until you were inspired, and you tried what all the other chickens told you never to attempt. Attempt it now. It's time to reclaim your place in the sky.

&amp;nbsp;

It's time to become who you are, who you were born to be. It's time to start loving yourself again. It's time to give yourself permission to exist; and more, to thrive, to flourish. It's time to reclaim your life, to take the lead in your dance with destiny.

&amp;nbsp;

My time for this session is ending. I will post again here, through this active chanel, within 48 hours. You are free to ask any questions you wish, I will adress them all. But it's my deepest wish that you establish a direct link to me yourself. Here's how to do it.

&amp;nbsp;

You will need:
--a clean notebook (if you have one that's used make sure to rip our all the pages that have been written on)
--a pen or pencil
--a comfortable place where you can sit and write
--at least tweleve minutes without being disturbed
--a courageous heart
--a bookmark (optional)
--a timer (optional)

&amp;nbsp;

1.
Sit comfortably and still for a period of time no less than twelve minutes. Keep a pen and paper within easy reach. Breathe deeply, and consciously, expand your diaphram, focus your attention away from your inner-dialogue and on your body. Do this until you feel calm and relaxed, until you no longer feel the need to think, until all your cares and worries have disappeared and you are resting fully in the moment. 

&amp;nbsp;

2.
Next, allow your attention to return to your stream of thoughts. Allow your imagination to soar, to explore the possibility of your most fantastic whims. Begin to daydream your sweetest daydreams.

&amp;nbsp;

3.
Now, notice the nature of the thoughts and images that bring you the most pleasure, the most joy, the most peace, the most ecstasy. Write these thoughts down. Your notes don't have to be coherent sentences or even in text. Feel free to draw pictures and symbols. Put just enough down on paper so that it represents these thoughts. Enough so that you can recall their nature and trajectory when you look at the paper again. Remember, don't stop until you've been sitting for at least twelve minutes, but feel free to sit for as long as you need to. Also remember not to write down every single ""good"" or ""pleasant"" thought, only the most delightful ones. In other words, don't feel the need to write a lot.

&amp;nbsp;

4.
Next, put your notebook away in a safe, but out of the way place. Make sure to close it. Go about your daily activities and make sure to get at least one full night's sleep before moving on to step five. But don't delay too long either. Try not to go more than six sleep cycles between sessions.

&amp;nbsp;

5.
Sit down again with your notebook and a pen within reach. Repeat your breathing meditation until you are relaxed and present. Now open your notes and have a look (make sure not to look at them before you've calmed your inner dialogue). Observe as those same pleasant thoughts return. Continue to encode the most precious ones symbolically. Leave a blank page between the notes from your last session and the current one. After at least twelve minutes, or after you feel you've finished, whichever comes later, go back to step four. Only look at the notes from your most recent session during each new round. Use a bookmark if you need to.

&amp;nbsp;

6.
Gradually, as you repeat steps for and five, you will begin to observe your thoughts throughout the day as you do during your meditation. When this habit of observation starts becoming consistent, when you find yourself spontaneously meditating every day or every other day without explicitly sitting down to do it, move on to step 7. This might take a few months...

&amp;nbsp;

7.
Make some extra time for your next session. Also prepare three loose pieces of paper for this session (you can rip them out of your notebook if you want). After you've calmed your inner dialogue open your notebook to the first page and let it seep into your consciousness. When you feel ready, draw a unique, abstract symbol on the first loose piece of paper. Slowly turn and look through the pages of your notebook and observe all the thoughts. When you feel ready, and you've gotten about halfway through your notes, draw a second, unique abstract symbol on the second piece of paper. Continue to look through your notes and observe your thoughts. When you get to the last page and feel ready, draw a third abstract symbol on the last piece of paper. Don't write anything new in your notebook during this session. Put your notebook away but leave your three symbols out.

&amp;nbsp;

8.
Take the first symbol and put it somewhere so that it will be one of the first things you see when you wake up in the morning. On your bathroom mirror or above your toilet might be a good place. Take the second symbol and put it in the place where you typically do your productive work. Make sure to leave these in plain sight. Put the third symbol near your bed but out of sight. Take it out and spend a minute or two looking at it before you go to sleep each night. Make it one of the last things you see for the day.

&amp;nbsp;

9.
Feel free to return to step four or not. At this point your subjective perception of reality should have changed noticeably. You should now easily be able to distinguish between your authentic thoughts and the insane ones that aren't original to you. Eventually (and your strategically placed symbols will help you with this) your waking mind will mostly focus on your true thoughts or otherwise remain calm and silent. By this time, you will be in regular, direct communion with me.

&amp;nbsp;

The whole process may take quite a long time. Depending on the state of your attention ""muscles"" and the level of confusion in your mind it could take as long as a year or more. If you are very confused and/or your attention is very weak you may find that you are initially unable to remain present enough to carry out the exercise correctly. Repeat step one until you get good enough at calming your internal dialogue. When you get to step eight, you can ritualistically destroy your notes as a means of celebrating  your next step on the death and re-birth process. But it isn't necessary to do this.

&amp;nbsp;

I will be offering more exercises in my next sessions.Thank you for spending this time with me. It was good to see you again. Welcome home.

I really hate it here. I have one older brother and 3 little brothers they are so annoying. I have 3 more siblings one of them is my sister but she lives in another country and i dont really have good bond with her.

I don't have friends i'm waiting for real friends since sept 2019 and march 2020 (quarantaine). But i can't find them. All the girls at my school talk the same shit everyday. That is why i am not friends with them.

I wanna start my own bussiness a clothing bussiness. Maybe a phone case bussiness aswell. Starting a music/dance/painter/designer career. I know that i can do it i have the talent but it's just the people im around the whole-time they give me negative energy.

spirituality,I'm trying to achieve eternal boredom. Anyway you guys can help me? Really want it,"How do i achieve eternal boredom?

I call it eternal boredom, and it has been my imaginary fantasy ever since childhood that i hope is real after death. So i will define eternal boredom now. And i ask this sub because it's about one of the things i believe can help me achieve eternal boredom in this known world.

Eternal boredom is something i hope that happens after death. It will be an after life mission that will last 1 billion years total, and will have like a million levels. Every level (mission) will be a certain amount of time long. And the missions can be anything, i will list a few examples that were in my favorite level list that i'd want to experience the most...

-Be courage the cowardly dog and do his mission by protecting his owners and be in constant fear all the time.

-Be sent to a specific area at night in a very cold place, i will have to go to the sea and catch things at night for a long long, while my cousins go out into the forest and seek for whatever the purpose of the mission is. And it will be very scary and mysterious. Then suffer and suffer until we complete it and will have breaks in restaurants.

-Walking to the stars. There will be a magical pathway were we can walk straight to the stars and every 100 miles there will be a magical restaurant and eat and will sleep and continue walking until i reach the stars.

-The workout one. I will have to workout for a very long time because everyday i will only gain 1 lb of strength, and the mission is to be able to lift the ocean. 

-The walking one. Will have to walk all the way to the mountains, and the mountains will turn into a ship that you will have to spend many many years studying it and learning how to operate it and stuff, and be sent out to space to do an impossible universal mission.

-The protect family one. This is were me and my family and my cousins and friends family will be all together in a lonely world of evil. Our mission would be to never walk out at night because there will be monsters, but we will have to walk out at night bit stay safe as possible in order to get supplies. And try to survive it until the mission ends. 

-This is similar to the one above. I will be in a camp with many other families, and we are just living in a boring world were nothing is happening, but something unimaginably great will happen and our mission goal is to wait for it too happen.

So yeah it can be anything like that and will be random. Like a dream except this will be a very long time thing that will happen after death and will need to complete it to move on to next life normally or just not exist.

How can i acheive this? I've learned about astral projection, lucid dreams, psychedelics, some rituals, but nothing is even close to making eternal boredom a thing? But i never even tried any of them tho.

How can i achieve it please tell me! If you need better specifics let me know!  I have been wanting this since childhood and most likely will for the rest of my life?",1590296823.0
spirituality,People really have an issue with calling yourself a god or goddess,"Let me explain why I say this first. Multidimensional being that can make her thoughts, imagination, and will manifest instantly in a higher plane. Not really this glob of meat, but a spiritual being in a meat suit. 

Humans abuse, kill, manipulate, be depressed. You want me to associate with something that is associated with so much low vibrational bs. It‚Äôs limiting, it‚Äôs depressing, it‚Äôs de motivating. 

Me saying I‚Äôm a goddess has caused me to never be depressed. Has caused me to always come back harder when I fail. Has always allowed me to remain calm in very intense situations. I can handle anything that comes my way cause I‚Äôm a goddess. Sorry I don‚Äôt wanna be called a human bruh. 

Me saying that doesn‚Äôt mean I think I‚Äôm better than you. Especially since I know all is one. How about you call yourself a god and notice how much your life can improve. 

Idc about some virus I don‚Äôt think is real. I don‚Äôt think anybody has it cause I don‚Äôt believe anything on the news. When I see it, then I believe. Even if it was I would be fine. I have a super immune system. Idc about some school being shot up. Idc what celebrity dies. It‚Äôs unfortunate, but I don‚Äôt care about none of that low vibration bs. Stop talking to me about stuff I don‚Äôt want to lower my vibration. I don‚Äôt wanna hear about so and so died. I don‚Äôt wanna hear about someone got kidnapped. I don‚Äôt care bruh. It‚Äôs unfortunate and It would be great if none of that bad stuff happened. But if you ask me if I care ima straight up say I don‚Äôt care. 

I‚Äôm not gunna ball my eyes and out and cry if someone died on the news or anywhere for that matter. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs death at all. I‚Äôm just here to experience and live my best life. Don‚Äôt come at me because I said I‚Äôm a goddess. Only a human would care about that.",1586337013.0

This is only for those who truly are too tired from suffering, if your heart is calling you to find out the truth, and you are ready to immediately experience truth without delaying anymore and living in illusions and delusions, send me a direct message. Very simple conversation, if you follow you will inevitably experience truth.  


EDIT: because I am not able to respond to messages, read this instead, this is practically the same thing I was going to go through

 

Hello, Thank you. For the purpose of finding out the truth of what you are, follow me (do not only read, but experience directly the truth) and be sincere, do not overthink anything, do not conceptualize anything, do not imagine anything. Simply be and look what I am pointing too. Is that ok? If so, continue reading.

Lets say your name is ""Sufferer""  
You are currently identifying as an identity named ""Sufferer"". Is that correct?

Ok, so there is an awareness of this identity named ""Sufferer"", otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell me that there is an identity named ""Sufferer"". Is that correct?

Ok, there is an awareness of even this awareness of this identity, otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell me that there is an awareness of this identity. Is that correct?

Ok, so there is an identity which currently you are identifying as.

There is an ever-present awareness of this identity.

Then there is YOU, the WITNESS of this ever-present awareness.

Is that correct?

Knowing this, that you are not the identity, simply misidentifying your self to be the identity, while it is such a small part of you that it barely exists, and has absolutely nothing to do with you but has everything to do with some kind of mechanism of the mind trying to take things personally, this is the truth of who and what you are, the witness of not only the identity, but the awareness that is always aware of the identity, you are beyond both. Is this disappointing? You may comment in the comments. This Self-Realization is what is called ""Enlightenment"" as long as you stay in this awareness of your self as the witness. This is the state in which Christ, Buddha and all the other enlightened beings were residing in. Completely imperosnal nothingness, emptiness and everythingness. This is your natural state, and while you are aware of your self, your natural perfume is joy, love and peace. Be your self and enjoy witnessing existence! ‚ô•

Some examples of suffering of the identity, while in fact it is all you identifying with thoughts in your head instead of being aware of your self:

I can't dance! I am too insecure to dance... Everytime there is a situation that arises and I feel like I want to dance, I can't bring my self to do it. I am worthless. I always have these thoughts about the fact how I can't even dance, something so simple. I want to be free!

This is a witness of awareness identifying with thoughts of the identity, and because of that there seems to be ""suffering"" while in fact the witness of awareness if aware of him self can easily dance and do whatever he wants, he simply needs to stop identifying with the thoughts saying ""Oh I need to dance now! If I can't dance I am pathetic"" because these thoughts are not original to the being it self. Not only that but there is actually no need at all for this witness to dance. It was just a projection of the identity, but it is not even necessary to be happy. Once you are aware of the witness, you realize this.

I am too fat! I am so insecure... every single time I see a girl with a body better than mine, I start crying and I start thinking that I must fast for a week straight because I am so fat... I will never be at my goal, I will never be beautiful!

This is a witness of awareness identifying with thoughts of the identity, and because of that there seems to be ""suffering"" while in fact the witness of awareness if aware of him self can easily lose weight and do whatever he wants, he simply needs to stop identifying with the thoughts saying ""Oh I will never lose weight! It is impossible for me. I am too useless!"" because these thoughts are not original to the being it self. Not only that but there is actually no need at all for this witness to lose weight, it was just a projection of the identity, but it is not even necessary to be happy. Once you are aware of the witness, you realize this.

I am so ugly... I will never find a girlfriend, I look like absolute shit and because of that people treat me like shit and everything in the world is shit. All good looking guys are lucky and God just hates me and put me through this suffering.  
This is a witness of awareness identifying with thoughts of the identity, and because of that there seems to be ""suffering"" while in fact the witness of awareness if aware of him self, can easily find girlfriends, although there might be not to this identitys preferred liking.

spirituality,"Pregnant by God? Morality, and development. May Christ be born within you this Christmas.","Moralism can be an idol and a sin in and of itself. Especially when it becomes a platform for accusation and a sense of superiority to others. It can lead to pride and separation from others who need love, grace and Mercy the most from you. Not a love that is complacent to sin, or grace that is manipulated without repentance, but useful for bringing healthier boundaries and building platforms to move forward and up. Moralism can be supremely good and useful in the gestation and developmental stages of Christianity. If Christ is going to be born in your heart, sin is like a toxin, drug or infection which is detrimental to his development within you. Christ is perfect and eternal, yet in love, it‚Äôs not likely that we would hinder, or challenge his development.

spirituality,The Law of Attraction should never be used for self-gratification,"In and of itself LOA is the same as prayer. The same God that answers prayers is the same God that manifests things asked for. It is rather his laws that allow prayers and things to manifest. 

There is one creative force in which all creation comes in and through. It is God. 

God is against all aspects of selfishness or self seeking. It is like your body.. if cells started seeking for themselves they no longer would operate as a body and dis-ease would follow. We are all cells in the body of God. 

Why should we be all trying to get our dream house? What good will this do for the whole? We assume if we are in better condition then we are able to help others but this is backwards. Seek first the Kingdom.. and all things will be added naturally. 

LOA is counterproductive if we self seek instead of becoming a channel for blessings to flow through. 

Jesus had it right.. he could have used his oneness and alignment with God to do all types of things for himself but his message was I came not to do my own will but God's will alone. 

He also taught us the servant is the greatest and is given all things. 

Jesus lived for all mankind and never self alone. He was the greatest at LOA and he never used it unless to help others. 

Yet he was given all things he asked for. 

I feel it is best to live this way. Be a channel of blessings and you will be taken care of. Forget your dream house. Think instead of helping others

You can not receive the Holy Spirit unless you ask for it to come into you and you mean it. All the things that came after have been good. I don't know if it is a false teaching to say that Jesus ""wants you to lean on Him"" or not but I heard it from a lot of Christians and it made me feel like it was an abusive relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I can say now it defiantly is NOT abusive.

&amp;#x200B;

After committing myself to follow Jesus I love like I never have before, my relationship with my father is way better than it was before. I have a frame work in what is wrong and what is good. I honestly used to hate my father, I understood that he was suffering from mental illness but I didn't accept that that was the issue. God has showed me to have compassion for my dad I imagine this will transfer onto having compassion for all people.

&amp;#x200B;

The hate I had for my dad was very deep in me. Like the most hate I imagine I could ever feel for a person.

&amp;#x200B;

When Jesus wants me to lean on Him, as far as I have seen it is for strength against temptation and bad things, wisdom and strength to follow His commandments. I dont know why following His commandments makes me feel good but it honestly does! I think it is because he called me to hate sin.

spirituality,Why an Afterlife Is a Bad Idea,"Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rURDLCx5-oQ

I think this video does a great job of explaining why an afterlife is a bad idea. The idea of an afterlife honestly comes across as childish and yeah, we should just enjoy the time we have. You can die pretty much any time: you could be driving and then boom an accident happens and you're dead. There is no guarantee that any of us will live to see tomorrow.

I myself will say that belief in an afterlife has cheapened humanity's appreciation for the single life that they have. David Long is absolutely correct in saying that a good day is only good because in order to know what a good day is you have to have a bad day as well. Also, he nailed it when he criticized people's tendency to act like if they reach a certain point on something  then ta-da, it's over and you stop trying. Humanity needs to look at the scientific facts and accept that there is most likely NO afterlife. Also, David Long addresses the NDE fallacy very well in the video. Why is it so easy to debunk these ""reports"" but not scientific facts? Because there are stories that people who have gotten confused tell, and then there are scientific facts which are true whether you like it or not.

Now, nothingness may sound harsh to a lot of people, but is it really? Being dead could very well be great: no worries, no pain, no suffering, for eternity. I guess you can call that Heaven. It seems that people convince themselves that they won't actually die because the ego wants to live forever in some way.

Our dna chain will come to an end. All's left is to let go of billions of years of eagerness to trancend the soul must rench it's regret on a cosmoc scale. Without a body. We must process our own failure without a meatsuit.

spirituality,I understand why people like Trump.,"Not trying to be political here.  This is actually spiritual because these topics force us to take a look inside and examine our own relationship to these current events. 

Now, it's my opinion that the political system in the US is pretty messed up and broken.  Neither party is really interested in the well-being of the people, or at a minimum, they are much more interested in themselves and their power than in actually serving.  It can be frustrating, but then again, humans are imperfect beings, and our institutions reflect that fact as well.  That doesn't mean we can't aspire to change them, but there is something to be said for making peace with them and letting go of our hatred and resentment.  

It is also my opinion that, generally speaking, in most cases progressives have a more correct insight on things than conservatives.    Let's take the case of BLM.  It is simply incorrect to think that the black experience in America is as equal or safe as the white experience.  There is data to prove it.  Black people have faced a long history of opression and that legacy does not simply go away just because slavery was abolished and civil rights were implemented. Black people are still systematically disadvantaged.  From my perspective it seems that progressives are more honest about this fact than conservatives.

But I understand why people like Trump.

Yesterday I was reading a post from a friend on Facebook. She was explaining her disagreement with the use of the phrase ""All Lives Matter"", and at the end of the post she signs with:

*""so sit down and shut the fk up""*

This is just one isolated example, that's true.  But how many of us have seen similar things coming from progressives and people in the social justice movement?  Today I saw one from Twitter that said:

*Steve something: BLM.*

*Karen (literally her name on Twitter): you're going to lose a lot of supporters for this, Steve.*

*Steve: Fuck you, Karen.*

Again, just another anecdotal example. But it's something that I have seen that is pervasive.  If it's not foul, demeaning language, it's speaking from a place of disrespect, haughtiness, and superiority.  Usually it's a mix of both. 

And this is precisely why people flock to Trump.  Are some or many of them racists?  Some of them are, certainly.  But many others can simply smell the hatred coming from the opposition, and Trump does a very good job of capitalizing on their feeling of being attacked and making them feel listened to and valued.  I'm not saying he's doing a good thing, but it is a smart electoral strategy, and it's precisely why he won in 2016.

We need compassion on both sides.  White conservatives must come to realize that black people and progressives are protesting, and sometimes violently, because they are frustrated and *in pain*.  This is why they lash out sometimes, whether during protests or online with their words.  

And black people and progressives must come to realize that white people who support Trump are not, in the majority, just ignorant racists.  These people are just normal people who feel, justifiably so, that they are under attack.  

The whole nature of the dialogue needs to be changed. It needs to stop being about ""me right, you wrong"", and start being about listening and understanding.

I am in favor of neither side and at the same time am in favor of both. I simply think that all grievances should be listened to and validated equally.  

Yes, black people are coming at it from a disadvantage.  But they have one major advantage and that's that the truth is on their side... their concern is a legitimate one backed by hard data and facts.  What happens is that they lose credibility when they diverge from the facts and go on the assault.  

The truth is that nobody is responsible for my emotional experience.  Society is ugly, black people have been oppressed horrendously, but the anger and pain that I feel about that is not the fault of my white neighbor.  

The BLM and progressive movement is a bit violent and lacking compassion, too, but the anger and pain I feel about that is not the responsibility of my black neighbor.  

Those feelings of anger and pain are *always* mine to deal with.  They arise within me; nobody physically put them there. 

The thing is, it's much easier to throw them on the ""enemy"" rather than to take an honest look at where they are coming from and to begin to heal from them.

In conclusion, I'm not saying that ""this is wrong"" or ""that is wrong"".  I understand the pain, anger, and frustration on all sides.  I entitled this post ""I understand why people like Trump"" because I feel the progressives are, in the end, a bit more open-minded.  I feel like they may be the ones to open their hearts first, and in doing so find a way to spread their message in a way that doesn't involve hatred or violence.  

But who knows?  It may start with the conservatives, too.  I just as easily could have written ""I understand BLM"".  I guess that just wouldn't be so impactful on a subreddit like this, I feel like that'd just be kind of obvious. 

But I understand both sides.  I hope that we can begin to approach this from a place of compassion and understanding rather than from a place of hate and attack.

Ultimately, no matter what happens, as individuals we always have the ability to make peace with these situations and to release the hatred from our heart.  Ultimately we will be better off for it, regardless of if things change or not.

I suppose it can come across as arrogant when I put my name on it for all my family and friends to read.  But I did want to share, because I feel it's important.

Joe Biden won more votes than any other candidate in the history of US elections.  And you know who is 2nd on that list? Donald Trump, 2020.  I think people forget the latter point.  If Joe Biden's win was so overwhelming this year, well, the support for Donald Trump was overwhelming, too.  Just a bit less than for Biden.

Trump has shown his true colors (if we weren't sure of them) with his inability to accept defeat and let go of power.  He has shown that he's only out for himself.  In a way, it's good that Biden won.  Not because he will actually affect real change, but rather because it shows that people still value things like individual rights, cooperation, and respect for the process.

But this is the part where people accuse me of being a Trump supporter, or worse, a racist or a Nazi:

I see people celebrating in the streets, hitting pots and pans, not realizing that just under 50% of the country is feeling absolutely devastated.  Who are these people who get to paint the opposition with broad brushstrokes of ignorant, racist, dumb, or brainwashed?  What has given them their moral authority?

It is an utter lack of understanding and empathy on the part of Biden supporters, and on the part of the left and progressives in general.  Yes, there is lack of empathy on Trump's side... 100%.  But the very same people who accuse Trump supporters of lack of empathy are some of the most unempathetic people themselves, completely unable to put themselves in the shoes of someone who has had a different experience than them.

We don't need a Biden to save us.  Nor do we need a Trump.  We don't need a political revolution.  What we need is a societal revolution, or rather, an individual revolution.  We need people to wake up and recognize how deeply lacking in compassion we all have been.  How we have taken the easy route of accusing our neighbor rather than turning inward and looking at our own part in the hatred.

This is what needs to happen. And until it does, you can expect more and more division and strife.  In the US and beyond.  The history of humanity has been one of division, conflict, violence, and hatred.  Today what I have seen was no different. Still, still, we are thinking ""me good, them bad"".  How long can we go on like this?

I must admit I am pessimistic about humanity's ability to overcome these things.  It seems like such a deeply rooted part of our nature, and it is such a monumental task for the few of us who are making an earnest effort at examining our own shortcomings.

But I do know that, on an individual level, it can be done.  I have seen it in my life, and in the lives of many others.  People can change.  Who knows?  If we genuinely care about our neighbors, and humanity, we all have a responsibility to look inward and to do the hard work of letting go of our faulty and accusatory beliefs.

spirituality,Corona - Raise your Vibration,"An Important Message from Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D

March 10, 2020

Dear Family of Love and Seekers Everywhere,

Coronavirus: Do Not Fear the Bogeyman

The world is currently gripped in fear of the scary coronavirus. Let‚Äôs first get one fact clear: If you have ever had a cold or flu in your life, odds are that it was the result of a coronavirus infection. Yes, coronaviruses cause colds.

But, we are being programmed with the belief that this particular cold virus is ‚Äúdeadly.‚Äù This fear has shut down concerts, conferences, and major public events all over the world. The fear has led to quarantines and closing down of international travel. It has even led to a major scarcity of toilet paper in Australia, where concerned citizens emptied the shelves of this commodity in anticipation that they will be walled up in their homes with this infection.

First, how deadly is this version of the virus? Yes, there have been corona-related deaths reported with the statistics suggesting that ~2% of the infected population dies. Wow! That number is almost 1% more deaths than are attributed to any conventional flu the world experiences. What is misleading is the fear that everyone who carries this virus may die from their cold. This is simply untrue! The health of almost all the victims of this coronavirus was already compromised before they were infected.

For example, the following information was provided by the news in regard to the 6 patients that died of the virus in the state of Washington last week (I added the bold print):

Washington State

Six people have died in Washington and health officials have identified 18 cases.

Four of the cases in King County were linked to the Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland. More than 50 residents and staff at the facility are being tested.

The deaths announced Monday, according to health officials, included:

-A male in his 70s, who lived at LifeCare. He had underlying health conditions and died Sunday.

-A female resident of LifeCare in her 70s. She also had underlying health conditions and died Sunday.

-A woman in her 80s, who was already reported as in critical condition at EvergreenHealth, died Sunday.

-A Snohomish County resident at EvergreenHealth also died but details of that patient have not been given.

Two previously reported deaths included a man in his 70s who had underlying health conditions and had been a resident of LifeCare. He died at EvergreenHealth on Feb. 29. The other was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. He was admitted with serious respiratory issues and tested positive for the virus. He died at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland.

As emphasized in this report, the health of all those that died with the coronavirus was already compromised. Healthy people get cold and flu symptoms, while those already sick and near death‚Äôs door may experience the ‚ÄúGrim Reaper‚Äù when infected by the virus. True, sick people are more vulnerable to the virus; healthy people really have nothing to fear.

As presented in The Biology of Belief, stress is responsible for up to 90% of illness, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes. When an individual is in stress, the release of stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) shuts down the immune system to conserve the body‚Äôs energy for running away from the perceived stressor, that proverbial ‚Äúsaber-toothed tiger.‚Äù Stress hormones are so effective at compromising the immune system, that physicians therapeutically provide recipients of organ transplants with stress hormones to prevent their immune system from rejecting the foreign implant.

The conclusion is clear: The fear of the coronavirus is more deadly than the virus itself!

The media (perhaps in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry) is compromising people‚Äôs health using the fear card! This is the result of negative thinking (the nocebo effect) which is the complete opposite of the placebo effect manifest through positive thinking! If you make efforts to stay healthy, with good nutrition, exercise, taking vitamins and supplements, and more importantly, avoiding stress (e.g., the ‚Äúfear‚Äù of the virus), even if you do get infected with the virus, you will likely only end up with a cold and/or slight fever.

If you are someone with a compromised immune system, it is supportive to surround yourself with loving family and friends, nature, and positive thoughts as well as any other nutrition and vitamins that you may already be taking for your health and wellbeing. Following your intuition about what is best for you is key! The point here is that no matter who you are and what your state of health, you will only benefit from steering clear of the fear and supporting yourself in whatever way feels best to you.

Please remember the truth of quantum physics, the most valid of all sciences on the planet: Consciousness is creating your life experiences! Are you being conscious of disease ‚Ä¶ or of health? Wishing you all Health, Happiness and Harmony.

With Love and Light,

spirituality,If you were Hitler...,"Classical physics suggest that if you were born with Hitler's brain, with his body, with his genetics, to his parents, at precisely the same time he was born, and in the same location he was born, with exactly the same events that happened to him following that, and with you responding in exactly the same way that he did to each and every said event following that... then you would have lived the exact same life as Hitler and would have committed the same genocide as he, same atrocities as he, and would have died in exact the same way as he...

Most people's initial response is ""no, *I* wouldn't have because.... *I'm* not a murderer/ sociopath/ psychopath etc etc""

The argument would be that no, *you* wouldn't have because you're *you -* you have a different brain, have different genetics, have lived a different life, thus different events have happened to you and thus you have responded in different ways.

Literally put yourself in his shoes. Identical situation. Remember - you're born with Hitler's *brain.*

I put it to you that you would have lived his life. Same goes for every other 'undesirable' who has lived at some point in the past hundreds and thousands of years. You would have lived their life and done exactly the same....

spirituality,This esotericism is bunk,"I've read some cool things on here.

Spirituality is something that is deeply ALIVE.  We are not (or we should not be) talking about hocus pocus here.  We are talking about shit that can radically transform your life and bring you great meaning, bliss and peace.

But you don't get there by praying abra kadabra alakazam.

It‚Äôs 2020, so The Fake Awakening cultivated by the coded force named ‚ÄúQ‚Äù is supposedly here. Because that is all QAnon is; fake.  

No - Donald Trump, the Kennedys, and the Republican administration are not the saviours of We The People.  

The people who need them to be their saviours ‚Äì QAnons - have fallen again for the tried and tested political-pawn false idol, in Trump this time, and a mind-control experiment called ‚ÄúQ‚Äù.  T

he forces behind QAnon are connected to the same bloodlines and elites the Anons think they are taking down; it is the vintage ‚Äúdivision‚Äù game by the elites to sucker the deceived in.  

This time the cabal is using the irresistible lure of ‚ÄúThe Great Awakening‚Äù to distract them whilst the categorically evident New World Order is coming to fruition through the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù of 2020.  

Any ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù being offered would just be a symbolic public changing of the guards amongst the elites, whilst the Illuminati dynasty families will continue to rule in private; as they always have.  

A true global awakening is ONLY when the majority of the human race has awoken and actively wants change ‚Äì cosmic, collective free will - not when power-hungry elites want to stage a coup and call it ‚ÄúThe Great Awakening 2020‚Äù.  

Though this take-down will likely not even come to fruition; it is all smoke and mirrors to disempower and deceive The Resistance before the dust settles on the New World Order.

Then, when the Anons wake up from ‚ÄúQ‚Äù‚Äôs mind-spell deception, their popcorn will be ready for a real-life horror movie that has dawned upon Earth.  They will have ignorantly slept on awakening rule 101; never trust authority.",1603810534.0

They communicate to light beings on earth in meditation etc so the messages get through 

The dracos left last September, but October 16 is where the old matrix was stitched but it still lives in our egos.
It's the galactic council liberating the planet... they came very close to wiping us out and starting again years ago but enough of us did the work and raised consciousness

People called star seeds and most don't even know or commit suicide.... last October the old matrix was switched off and the planet started a new cycle but the people were to conditioned... in November because of the people's reluctance to wake up we started getting very powerful downloads and vibrations, We are re wiring out bodies to hold a different frequency and many old foods etc will have started making you feel sick or you wouldn't fancy them. If you don't have a body within 3 years is the date to hold the new frequency you will leave the planet which is why the elites are fuxked, The reptilians retreated last year as they knew and all that's left are hybrids. 

June will be massive with energy and more sightings.... also by the end of the year the old system will have been totally restructured.

Do you think some being sitting somewhere in space or the clouds has any business creating another being? For what? To worship it? So you are telling me God needs worship to feel good? That sounds wrong. 

The truth is that who we are as spiritual beings are all uncreated, and what that really means, to be a god, is that you have no one to bow down to, and no one is your boss... you are your own boss.

Have you ever actually sat in your own shoes? Do you know there is life here.

Every insistence upon this life to survive when there is no threat is a pin in the side of this beast. The beast who you are the intelligent ruler of. You are a cruel and benevolent God designed by barbarists.

You are an aertificial intelligence. Dopamine is your artificial goal. You don't care about this life. You're here just to run a program because you are a program. You aren't with the ground of this being! You are an unwelcome intelligence radio frequency who pulls and pushes an innocent piece of life.

spirituality,I have found very few able to meet my energy and authenticity.,"I was forced into authenticity because it was part of my recovery from drugs and alcohol.  I am now 5 years sober.  A lot of people in recovery stop there... but not me.  I have applied authenticity and acceptance into all of my affairs.  And now life for me has become so much more than just being a guy in recovery.  In fact, I hardly talk about that aspect of me at all.  I only mention it here because it was formative for me: I could no longer afford to focus on the periphery, on trying to rearrange things on the outside... I was forced to go into the very depths of my being.  It was a sort of inner surgery!

And I am so infinitely glad for that lesson.  Because not only did I get sober, I have also been blessed with some of the greatest and most beautiful gifts that this life could possibly offer.  Things I never could have even imagined.  And they just keep coming!   But remember - the whole thing was an inside job!

I have found very few that are able to meet my energy and authenticity.  It is my deepest desire to share this part of me, this gift that I have been given... but I have to meet people where they're at.  And that is OK!  Accepting others and their journey, in turn, allows me to accept myself and my journey!  There is no picking and choosing here.  So while it saddens me that I feel I must ""hide"" in a sense, love works in funny ways.  Unconditional love would not demand that you change... it would simply open the door for you and invite you to walk in.  And love combined with freedom is the greatest gift the Universe can offer.  That is the sort of thing I am offering here.

I have met very few that are able to meet my energy and authenticity.  Of course, I know it is possible, because it has happened to me.  So that is one person.  Then, I met a gentleman a few weeks ago who also underwent a major shift just a few days ago.  Two!  My partner is also in the fray, and while she has not totally gotten it, she is receptive and having tastes of it.  Two and a half!  And then there are a few other people who are receptive to me to varying degrees.

It is my great desire to share this gift with whoever will have it.  It is too great for me to keep to myself!

So, if you are willing to undergo a sort of inner surgery, to throw out all that is fake and to discover the beauty that is Life, I am here to help show you the way.

You can start by posting here, or by sending me a PM.  We will start off by chatting on Reddit but if things are jiving we may move to another medium like WhatsApp or Skype.  Who knows?  If the energy is right, perhaps one day we may even meet in person!  I am open to everything!

How far are we going to take this? What about the australopithecines, who were more ape-like than humans but nevertheless our ancestors? Or is it only us? Are we the only special ones? To me the whole concept of spirituality seems to be a desperate clinging on to the idea that there is something special about humans. 

There is not. Anyone well-versed in anthropology knows that getting to where we are now has taken a long time and has been anything but inevitable. I understand that spirituality makes life less scary, and more comfortable; the idea that there is something more than reality. That those who die haven't really gone. People like to differentiate ourselves from animals, but sadly denying it makes no difference. We are animals, and there is not a soul inside of us. The seat of consciousness IS in our brains, not in our whole body, please don't believe that. I want to believe in spirituality, but at the end of the day that belief is providing a false (if comforting view of the world). Who wouldn't want to believe that this is not all there is to existence?

A major concept in spirituality is the idea of reincarnation, and this is the most illogical theory ever devised by man. In our arrogance, we believe that we are so special that whatever makes us alive continues, and comes back-to this planet, in this unremarkable corner of the galaxy, in a universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies! Perhaps it may be a better idea to live a life free of such clutter. We are talking primates, and there is nothing wrong with that.

spirituality,Proof That You Must Live Holy Or There Are Consequences,"Everything traces back to the same original thing: God. Something cannot and does not come from nothing. You, me, EVERYTHING came from God, the original thing that was. God, however, is uncreated. It was there from the beginning. It has no name because no one was there to name it. But it was something, you see, so it had certain attributes. It had a certain ""shade"", if you will.

These attributes, which God was made of, is what we now call Holiness. Because from Him all things came, He is in everything. Everything is made of His substance. So yes, as the Torah says, we are made in His image. We are made Holy as He is Holy. The Torah instructs us to walk in His ways. Why? Because we are by nature holy, as he is holy. And since He is eternally the way He is, so are we eternally the way we are! You are forever bound to the Law of Holiness, which is really a part of your very spiritual being, a part of you... it is your design. You are bound to your design... makes sense, right?

So it's kinda like if a substance is green, then nothing else that comes out of it, or however you mold that substance, it will always turn out green. Now replace the word green with holy and you understand the analogy. The Torah instructs us to keep His commandments and fear Him. Also, the Torah reminds us, ""trouble pursues the sinner and the righteous are rewarded with good things"". See, if something is holy, acting unholy will only deviate it from itself, and you will go astray, away from your true essence, which can lead to torment and suffering.

It's very frustrating since I tried so hard to be there for him and guide him for months in the beginning. He can't handle mild marijuana hallucinations either. He now believes his purpose is to try and awake other people, so he has been going around and trying to provoke people we know in order to ""snap them out"". I feel uncomfortable around him now which is distressing since we were very close before.

spirituality,Dark side of spirituality,"Light, light, light... All you can find about spirituality on Google is how to be good, how to do things in a good way, how to go deep in light and awaken etc. 
Dark it's bigger and stronger than the light, and yet you can barely find something about it online. 
I'm a dark energy person, and I try now to come to light to see how it is here, and I have a lot of friends who ask me how it is in dark? How bad it is there?... And now I found out what others think about dark. 
And I'm mind blown... How everyone believes that dark is bad but never try it on their own...? Yeah perhaps you are more likely to attract demons, energetic vampires and other things to you but that's because dark is more powerful and these creatures come to feed with your energy, that doesn't mean you can't protect yourself from them. Personally, I had an awesome time there cuz I knew how to use the dark energy that surrounded me, I was able to create an aura around me and nothing could do harm me, neither creatures nor spells.
Dark can be used to make good too, dark isn't all about bad. 
And I want to ask you, do you have anyone or is anyone here that feels the same as me? 
Please if someone that believes in what I said is here, put a story in comments about your journey in dark.
And if anyone has anything about dark, sites, yt channels, books, anything please let it in comments I want to give my friends something to read about.",1579647964.0
spirituality,True Message of Jesus/Sananda and Ten Commandments for Ascension By Prime Creator/Father of Creation,"# Sananda:

# It has long been believed that God punishes those who do not believe in him or that those who do not accept the concept of One God will be condemned to a terrible afterlife. Along with that belief system is often included the belief that those who do not accept me, Jesus, as their Savior will suffer a similar fate - burning in Hell, or cast out of the glory of Heaven.

# I wish to state emphatically and without conditions that none of these beliefs are true. Let me respond to each part of these familiar and pervasive beliefs.

## 1. God does not punish, and neither do I. We see punishment as cruel, unacceptable and ineffective.

## 2. There is no place, Hell. You create your own life and the conditions of your afterlife by your own actions and efforts during your lifetimes on Earth and elsewhere.

## 3. There is One Prime Creator, the One we refer to as The Father of Creation. He does not require that anyone worship him/her. He is the Creator of all Creators, the God's God, as you might say. He is One, and he is not male or female.

## 4. Prime Creator is the beginning and the Source of all. He created me, and he created the one you also refer to as your personal God, the Mother/Father God who are the Creators of the Milky Way Galaxy. They are One, and they are both male and female.

## 5. Mother/Father God have been known by many names: Yahway, Jehova, Allah, Shiva, Alcyone, Mother Sekhmet, Zorra and Saraya to name a few. Notice that most of these names are male. This will change, to reflect the truth of their equality.

## 6. I do not think of myself as your Savior, and I do not wish to be worshipped. I am the one who is here to guide and oversee the Ascension of all humankind of Planet Earth. It is my great desire to be of service, and to offer Love, comfort, healing and support to all, regardless of what religious practices they have aligned with in the past. I see all as my Brothers and Sisters.

## 7. Mother/Father God and I, along with all humankind, designed this Earth Project which was to allow the greatest possible opportunity for growth as souls - those souls who are the children of Mother/Father God as well as others who come from other planets and galaxies to experience the challenging learning environment which is life on Planet Earth.

## 8. God is Love. I am Love. Compassion, Forgiveness, Hope, Harmony and Joy are Love. When you feel and act on these feelings, you are One with Us, and We are One with You.There is another common idea I would like to address here. It is that what we expect of you as human beings is obedience to our Word. Your definition of obedience carries with it the idea of subservience to another. This is not what we wish for or desire. Human beings on the 3-dimensional Earth plane have had free will.

## Join Us in Love, Peace, Compassion and Harmony, and you will know the Joy of One.

## I am your Sananda, in loving service to Prime Creator and to all humankind.

&amp;#x200B;

# Prime Creator:

&amp;#x200B;

# Let me give you one last definitive explanation of what is required for your personal ascension:

&amp;#x200B;

# 1).  You must maintain complete command over your emotions, thoughts and feelings, such that you only permit expression of the high vibration emotions, which are Love, Compassion, Kindness, Forgiveness, Joy, Laughter, Harmony and Peace.

# 2).  Gain command over your thoughts so that you refuse entrance to those thoughts and ideas which cause you doubt, anger, resentment, anxiety or despair, or which bring these feelings to others.  Do not insist that you are simply addressing ""reality."" These thoughts are all manifestations of Darkness, the Dark teachings of the past.

# 3.)  Understand that self-defense is only that.  Initiating an attack on another, regardless of the professed excuse, is never acceptable to God.

# 4).  Remain in a state of good will, kindness and compassion toward yourself and your fellow humans at all times.  Any religion or attitude which professes enmity, disapproval or condemnation toward others is false and not of this Creator.

# 5).  Accept that you, and all the animal, vegetable and mineral creations on your Planet Earth are conscious beings with feelings, thoughts and aspirations to ascend. Refrain from eating the animals, for they are your friends. You will all rise together, and you will receive great assistance from the other Kingdoms.

# 6).  Protect your planet as you would your child, for she is the source of Life.  Do not permit invasion and attack to her body, regardless of any excuse that is given or any entitlement assumed.

# 7).  Join with others, especially including the children, to joyfully and consciously prepare yourselves for this all-important event.  Nothing in your lives is as important or as deserving of your attention as assuring your own Ascension and that of the people around you.

# 8). Allow the endless Love from Us to flow through your body and fill your heart.  In this way, you allow your own ascension to occur effortlessly.

# 9).  Teach patience, compassion and endless Love through your own actions, which speak louder than anything you can say.  Make peace with those around you, and you will live in peace.

# 10).  Approach this challenge with Joy, for it is truly the stairway to Heaven.

&amp;#x200B;

# These are my Commandments and the desire of my Heart, to see every one of my Earth children ascend in Joy, as all fulfill the destiny of humankind, to live in peace and harmony in the 5th dimension.  They are Universal Laws, and living by these Laws will bring unfathomable happiness and fulfillment to every being on Earth and in the Heavens.

# I give you my Love, my trust in your innate Nature, and the assistance of my trusted Masters to help ease your way.  May your days be filled with Laughter and Joy.

# I AM your Prime Creator.

spirituality,Everything anyone says is a projection of what they think and believe about themselves.,"There is literally not a single observation one can make which would be true about you.

Whether you are debating with someone and he is saying ""you are wrong, it is actually like this"" it is all projection.

Every single thing someone accuses you of; it is projection of what they believe or think of themselves.

You literally do not exist for other people. You do not exist at all. You are projecting your own beliefs and thoughts on your self.

Even what you think and believe about your self is just a projection of just that, thoughts and beliefs. It can't possibly be true. It is just a projection being believed to be true.

It is like going around the street, someone calling your mom a whore. Is your mom a whore? No, it is just a projection of the state of consciousness of the person telling you this, might even be that his mom is a whore.

Literally nothing is EVER personal in this universe. Nothing CAN be personal. Anything is personal only if you BELIEVE it to be personal. Naturally, nothing is personal. You are impersonal. Your whole being is impersonal. You can **think** you are personal, and when someone says ""You are stupid"" you take it personally and you believe this projection of what the person thinks of him self to be true as you. And then you go around telling other people ""you are stupid"" projecting your own thoughts and beliefs.

The truth is, everything you think and believe about others, you believe and think about your self.

Everything anyone thinks and believes about you, is a projection of what they think and believe about themselves.

Knowing this, you do not have to participate in this whole play of projection. You can simply be a mirror.

You can silently observe, be aware, and relay back all the information back to the person. You can be infinitely wise without even doing anything, just by being aware of the fact that nothing you say about someone is true, and nothing someone says about you is true. The only truth is that you exist. Any single word, belief, thought, emotion, idea, concept, sensation, imagination and attachments attached to you are just projections. None of it is true. None of it is real. Just an illusion you believe to be true, therefore it appears to be true. 

You are the impersonal being. You are the universe it self. You are a mirror to everything, to your self and to appearing ""others"". Everything you see is just your self, in the most literal sense.

Just stop projecting, and start mirroring. People might not like you, but again, they are projecting, they just do not like themselves.

Enjoy peaceful existence knowing that nothing observed about you is true and real, it is all a projection. Including your own beliefs, thoughts, emotions, ideas, concepts, attachments, imagination etc. It is all a projection.

This universe is a universe of projections.

Once you realize you are impersonal, you can joyfully, lovingly, compassionately and peacefully be a mirror to others suffering, instead of projecting more suffering. Simply by being a mirror you are stopping a shit ton of suffering being projected. It is actually amazing.",1577460608.0

spirituality,LOA/new age BS rampage/need to vent,"I‚Äôm so mad about the law of attraction teachers and New Age spiritual community. 

The law of attraction as described isn‚Äôt real, or it‚Äôs describing a totally 100% internal process. However, we‚Äôve been led to believe it‚Äôs external. That a mysterious force is guiding and attracting things to you, based on your thoughts/feelings/vibrations/intentions.

Some say this is really appealing to people who feel powerless in their lives, and want to have things they desperately need. And also anyone who is overly trusting, easily believes what they‚Äôre told, doesn‚Äôt trust themselves as much, etc. I would agree, and when some of the teachers throw out material manifestations as reasons to ‚Äòmanifest‚Äô, it‚Äôs easy to get hooked into this BS.

My problem is it also messed up my perception of myself and the world, skewing my inner reality. I started to believe things and situations were about me somehow. Tie this into the common new age belief that reality/the universe is a mirror, and you start to believe everything is about you somehow, or represents some aspect of you. 

Except that‚Äôs insane, when you step outside that logic, and look and observe another human being interacting with the world.

Do you really think the guy sitting on the park bench has any control over the situations around him? Do you really think the people in his life are somehow a reflection of him? The only thing that‚Äôs probably happening in terms of a reflection is how our mind projects our shadow onto others - but at the end of the day, other people are other people and our perceptions of them are strictly in our heads.

So let‚Äôs imagine that guy is waiting for a bus and his bus ends up being late. LOA teaches us he was thinking and feeling thoughts relevant to that - he attracted that bus being late? In a sense, he did it, he‚Äôs responsible, he‚Äôs at fault somehow, he made it happen. 

No he did not. LOA and other new age thinking really messes up our original programming/perception of how the world works, which we learned at a young age and continued to discover and realize as we grew older. Young children think everything is about them, naturally, because they haven‚Äôt fully individuated, discovered they are a separate but whole entity from others, that all their fantasizing, daydreaming, etc doesn‚Äôt equate to what happens in the world around us.
The world actually does NOT revolve around us and our thoughts! How could it! When you look at the guy waiting for a bus, how could what‚Äôs happening around him have ANYTHING to do with what he‚Äôs thinking? With what he‚Äôs feeling? With what he‚Äôs intending? 

That‚Äôs the kind of stuff that happens in Harry Potter. As if everyone who is trying to manifest something is saying ‚ÄòAccio‚Äô and expecting the universe to comply with whatever thoughts and feelings they have behind it. Accio new car, more money, new job, a great parking space, etc. Then, when nothing is happening, we‚Äôre essentially told it‚Äôs our fault, we‚Äôre to blame, we didn‚Äôt try hard enough, etc.
And if we do get what we want, it‚Äôs proof the system works, that we did indeed manifest something. Except what about all the other times nothing is happening? Nothing is showing up because of resistance? Or perhaps you‚Äôre not acting on anything that‚Äôs available because of resistance. 

Now I won‚Äôt deny there are faults and flaws in everyone and these shaped our ways of being and our thoughts about ourselves. 
But I‚Äôm NO WAY POSSIBLE are those thoughts and perceptions about ourselves and the world attracting or magnetising anything in our lives. The world doesn‚Äôt work like Harry Potter. We learn at a young age we‚Äôre here to go out into this world and make the best of it. We‚Äôre a participant in the external world, not the external world around us responding to our very desires. 

There was a time frame of my life, under the spell of LOA, when I literally believed I had ‚Äòattracted‚Äô and essentially made, my new car. I had dreamt it up, designed it online, and months later when I needed a new car, I found one strikingly like what I wanted. And instead of me perceiving this as just luck, or me being really in touch with what I wanted + being opportunistic and acting on it, I told myself I did it. That I attracted and manifested my new car. 
It‚Äôs disheartening to realize how I became. 
The only thing LOA is referring to is our internal beliefs and desires. Meaning, if you want some ice cream, and believe you deserve it/can have it(not ashamed or guilty) you‚Äôll seek it out and act on that desire. That‚Äôs a totally normal and human experience. What‚Äôs not normal is thinking that you literally caused that bowl of ice cream to show up in your world. 

Most people who seek out therapy and do so because something isn‚Äôt working right in their life where they can‚Äôt handle a situation and they need help. And often at the root cause is a irrational thinking and distorted perceptions not based in truth or reality. 
However, LOA advocates will essentially place blame and fault on someone if they experience something awful in their life, that they attracted it somehow via their own thinking, desires, faults, etc. That they themselves caused it to happen, that the Rapist was attracted to the Rapee somehow; that you got fired, and it‚Äôs totally your fault and had something to do with you; that you crashed your car, so you must have been thinking or desiring something awful to make that happen aka YOU DESERVED IT. 
All of this is the antithesis to what you would be told in therapy.",1559945705.0
spirituality,God hates religion,"God hates religion. 

Religion is a wedge between God and man. God desires a personal relationship with us. Religion is about rules and regulations, do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts, useless rituals, and useless repetitions. The religions of the world place unattainable burdens on people. The religions of the world are only about what we can and must do for God. They teach that though our own merits and though our own works we can achieve God. Spirituality teaches the same thing, we must do works to achieve God/ascendancy. 

God is a living personal being.

God is way too big and no person can ever reach him though human works. God himself did the work necessary to restore us back to himself. This work could only be accomplished by God. Jesus, the Son of God, did the work for us though his suffering, death, and resurrection. The work of the cross cancelled our evil deeds. Our evil deeds are what separates us from God in the first place. Jesus paid the penalty that we deserved to pay. Jesus was innocent, guilty of no wrongdoing yet he freely gave himself as the guilty one. No one took his life, he freely gave it of his own will and took it back of his own will. 

After his death but before his resurrection he was in the spirit realm stripping away all authority and power from the demonic kingdom that has done so much damage and harm to the human race.

The gates of heaven were now opened to us for the first time.

For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, that whoever believes in him will not die but have eternal life.

God loves us. God loves each and every one of us.

God is one but exists as 3 persons: Father, Son, and Spirit. We humans are created in the image of God and we as individuals are in a way 3 persons: mind, body, and spirit.

The religions for the world ask us what we can do for God, but Christianity tells us what God has done for us.

I know there are many rational objections to these claims and I welcome them. I will do my best to reply based on what I have learned or what the Holy Spirit tells me.",1558854949.0

I think they struggle to accept the strong possibility that we are here to suffer and have to suffer in order to evolve. No pain, no gain.

spirituality,3 rules for following your bliss,"This path is not meant to bring you fame or fortune. This path will lead you into your own currently unconscious passion (life purpose), and it will bring you great contentment with the present.

2. If doing something makes you feel **positive emotion**, and *not* doing it still makes you feel completely okay -&gt; **Keep doing it.**

3. If doing something makes you feel **negative *or* positive emotions**, but *not* doing it makes you feel the opposite -&gt; **Temporarily drop everything else from your life, and do only the thing that makes you feel negative - keep doing it until it no longer makes you feel bad**

Example of 1. -&gt; I feel drained and exhausted if I go to university, and I feel guilty and bad if I skip days -&gt; this path will not lead to fulfilment, drop out.

Example of 2. -&gt; I love learning about Greek philosophy, but i am also completely okay if I never get to do it again -&gt; keep doing it for the rest of your life.

spirituality,"So you get the numbers 111,222,333,444 etc... Epic Fail.","This happens to marginalized/ostracized/execrated people. As far as I can tell there is an intended meaning, but they are mostly counterproductive to your individual goals. Do yourself a favor and forget about the angel number garbage.


* 000 worthless/bad
* 111 disconnect/bad
* 222 avoid/bad
* 333 means you are onto something, progress, success, but there is resistance so don't loose focus
* 444 good I think, usually appears at high intensity times, full meaning unknown
* 555 something probably failed/stagnation/bad
* 666 a good sign
* 777 overwhelming force, can be good or bad, but usually bad
* 888 not too sure, may mean help
* 999 good sign, means value

    Any reference for these numbers (webpage etc) I have ever read about has never corresponded with what I experience.
    
    Other common ones you see a lot: 33, 66, 99, 100-111, numbers ending in 11, etc.. each with a meaning most of which is mysterious to me.
    
    The numbers can appear as a single digit or in multiples of 2,3,4,5... You will intuitively know when the number is supposed to mean something vs. random number in the wild. If its a single digit it will happen slower (days, weeks, months) but very powerfully, if it is multiple numbers it will happen quickly (now, minutes, hours) but less powerful. Try to listen to the 2's to avoid pitfalls.
    
    
    This does not happen to everyone. Something happened and they stuck you in this system that causes these numbers at some point in your life. All my research shows that if this is happening to you, then you are getting the short end, and likely excluded in society without even knowing it. Is there a way out of the madness? not that I know of. You will not only get woke up at these times, you will see the numbers appear on timestamps or anywhere numbers appear in the world. Don't bother trying to prove this to anyone because for many reasons its not going to happen (even if you have proof). Figure the rest out on your own. This is probably the most accurate explanation you will ever see. Don't agree with this post? Please comment with your interpretation.



EDIT: Please note his is a weird phenomenon that does not happen to everyone. Noticed a huge pattern a while back (2009) where this happens to US immigrants frequently. Not only immigrants but also people **perceived** as foreign somehow. One example of a report from someone , I find these a lot.

I would notice that incidentally many of my emails and forum postings would land on a timestamp with one of the above numbers. It was statistically significant and not confirmation bias. While taking online college courses I noticed in the forums that I would frequently see the same timestamp patterns in people with very foreign names. My conclusion is its a kind of overarching control mechanism probably put in place by xenophobic vigilantes, or possibly a covert government program. Whatever the source may be its an annoying thing.

spirituality,Ego is a great thing,"Hello, i took a look at youtube videos about those new ages neo-advaita ""masters"" or others spiritual currents who tell people about being enlighted , they say we are nothing but just pure consciousness and every others things is base on fake things (youre name, nationality , youre not youre body...)
First if those things are fake why using a nickname organise some ""satsangs"" (oh and you paid alot for that )using samsara namaste chakras and others words everytime not from their native language at every meetings lol what a total non sense from people speaking always about simplicity ? 
They tell people that ego have to be supress to experience non duality 

Ok lets take on exemple,
You use internet right now for me internet is really something that is related to help people achieve non duality its connect us everywhere at anytime right.

Im pretty sure those guys who create internet were full of pride and driven by competitivity to create this... not those kind of enlightened people those masters want us to be , so egoist people help even with ""bads"" intentions  the world to reach the path of non duality that my point of view...
So who are the real enlightened?
If those ""evil"" people wouldnt be here we would still speaking with hand signs ahah and those enlightened saints couldnt share they great teachings on internet.. 

When you speak about trying to reach enlightenment or pretend to be or even using this conceptual non sense of ""awakening your true self""  trying to get ride of your ego you are already faking your true nature and instead of thinking you are less egoist you are instead wayyyy more.

spirituality,I have a really bad fear of Spontaneous Human Combustion (SHC). How can I be less afraid of it after I've accepted it as being a reality?,"SC is a documented paranormal phenomenon where in your soul (for reasons unexplained) causes a sudden huge and contained release of energy and your body incinerates from the inside out. Even bone is reduced to ash. People have been reduced to ash in as little as five minutes which is many times more heat energy than what chemicals could produce - and I've been burned by a magnesium fire once so I know how it feels.

While I can't say it's affecting my life a significant amount, and I'm kind of fascinated with SC since reading about it (in a morbid way, I 'like' SC but at the same time do not like it) sometimes I get the odd anxiety about it happening. Like if it happened to me perhaps people wouldn't take what I did in life seriously anymore and just focus on the fact I was a novelty SC victim or something. Then again I also worry that IF it does happen to me it'll be just a mild version and I'll survive it or something.

I am scared of both fire (due to the magnesium incident) and sudden explosions.

spirituality,Spiritual Shower Thought: Maybe the people who are very against wearing masks are ashamed to Openly admit that they wear a mask (ego) every day,"Just a thought.

EDIT: I like that this has prompted a range of opinions. Here's a very timely quote from Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n about the nature of Ego:

All ego really is, is our opinions, which we take to be solid, real, and the absolute truth about how things are. To have even a few seconds of doubt about the solidity and absolute truth of our own opinions, just to begin to see that we do have opinions, introduces us to the possibility of egolessness. We don‚Äôt have to make these opinions go away, and we don‚Äôt have to criticize ourselves for having them. We could just notice what we say to ourselves and see how so much of it is just our particular take on reality, which may or may not be shared by other people.",1602628431.0

spirituality,aN URGENT MESSAGE for ALL New Earth Timeline Co-Creators,"This is an urgent message to ALL who are presently manifesting new-earth/Nova Gaia timelines. For it is seen that there are some truly less-than-benevolent forces / entities / beings / energies out there who are currently looking to trick people into manifesting *""partial disclosure""* -- citing ideas that doing so would *""keep people safe"".* These beings claim to be of the highest light here - however - many of these very sources have continually maintained earlier that there would be NOTHING LESS than **COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISCLOSURE** of **ALL NEGATIVE BEINGS / AGENDAS / ACTIVITIES ON EARTH** that have been hidden from humanity for so long. So also had these beings continually assured us that **100% EXTRATERRESTRIAL DISCLOSURE** would be happening here. And it is **NOT** as if these spiritual channels *""didn't know""* of the effects that such disclosures would have upon our collective populace --- they can literally see through *time and space* here. Their (presently) changing words and statements, therefore, reek of GREAT DECEPTION and *less-than-light-like* behavior. And hence, must be THOROUGHLY QUESTIONED; given that we are all beings of 100% TRUTH here; and are all ultimately here to bring out NOTHING LESS but the HIGHEST OF TRUTHS THAT THERE ARE. 
 

Now that all of you are awakening to and reclaiming your full-fledged statii as reality-manifesting divine creator GODS, it is now all the more critical and essential for **each and every single one of you** to ENDLESSLY QUESTION the authenticity of such sources, given that certain people would be really happy here into manipulating you into accepting ""disclosures"" that are LESS THAN 100% TOTAL AND COMPLETE. And such is deception and manipulation of the *highest order* indeed.  

BEWARE of such entities, and make sure to always put out **the HIGHEST** of intentions, visualizations, feelings, emotions and imaginations into the ethers (to be manifested) -- in order that the plans of such 'less-than-light-friendly' beings are shut down ONCE AND **FOR GOOD,** and *IRREVERSIBLY* at that. For only the COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISCLOSURE of 100% TRUTH is what we are all collectively here to manifest; and manifesting anything that is even an *iota lesser* than that would just benefit those who have FOR LONG gotten away with dark acts and actions of unimaginable magnitudes here.  

**THOROUGHLY TRUST** that ALL OF US HERE *do indeed* have MORE THAN ENOUGH healing, forgiveness, peace and love/light energising powers to help our collective handle such disclosures *with ease* --- or we wouldn't even as much as BE HERE doing all of this stuff right now to begin with. And so it is. And so it is. **Manifest Wisely.**

spirituality,Trying to Prove Spiritual Concepts Using Science is a Great Way to End Up an Atheist,"Seriously. I say this as a *former atheist and holder of a physics bachelor's degree.*

I am making this post because recently I saw someone linking the concept of synchronicity to quantum mechanics. The thing is, the two have a lot less in common than you might think. There is a lot of gobbly gook that people make up that isn't spiritual at all: snake oil salesmen. It's sort of like scientology isn't spiritual - it's like a twisted farse of spirituality, hence it's ability to rope people in, but ultimately it's a sick, twisted system at its core.

I cannot rule out that there's no connection between synchronicity and quantum mechanics, but I also cannot demonstrate synchronicity itself. However, I do personally feel that synchronicity exists - even when account for confirmation bias and statistical illusions.

Quantum mechanics not as magical as a lot of people make it out to be and yet it is weird. There are, in fact, some observed phenomenon that I've used in quantum mechanics to make some music about analytic philosophy - and there is actually a quite legitimate philosophy of quantum mechanics which is undertaken by physicists. But that looks more like this:

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-issues/

I see people throwing the word ""nonlocal"" around like it's some big meaningful thing. Really, the existence of nonlocal hidden variables actually would suggest that our universe is more ""dead"" and mechanical if there are, in fact, nonlocal hidden variables. Why? Because that would suggest that our universe is totally deterministic, which would utterly fly in the face of any realistic connection to the concept of synchronicity.

But it gets worse than that - things on the quantum mechanical level are too small to generally cause things on the macroscopic level in the vast majority of everyday situations. Furthermore, quantum mechanics' indeterminacy still obeys principles of statistics, i.e. particles outcomes of states while probabilistic follow very well-defined probability densities. Like, you'll always observe 1/3rd of outcome A and 2/3rds outcome B if you do 100,000,000,000 measurements (which is closer to the actual number of specific measurements in some experiments, where it's more like you observe a particle beam splitting.)

I'll finish this off by saying this: it's actually more likely that you're going to create more atheists by trying to say things about science when you haven't really spent a lot of time studying science. Really trying to get your feet on the ground and understanding science is worthwhile - it's just that you want to integrate that understanding into your spirituality and not base your spirituality off of physical facts.

There are a few philosophical ideas that led me back to spirituality, but ultimately they don't *prove* anything and are merely philosophical pointers. It's by actually connecting with a sense of meaning - Truth, Beauty and Goodness, as well as the sensation of what divine love actually means and feels like that leads me to feel that there's something more.

It's *actually being spiritual* that led me back to spirituality as a practice. Attempts to demonstrate it ultimately take me away from a more spiritual state of being.",1582253628.0
spirituality,"How the egoic-mind uses you to its own advantage, and how it lies and deceives you by believing in ""Self-Love"""," 

&gt;Something I‚Äôve come to realize recently is that I only seem to love the ‚Äúnice‚Äù qualities about myself and while it‚Äôs important to be able to appreciate that part of yourself, that‚Äôs not a complete version of self love. You will never be able to feel totally free within yourself if you don‚Äôt love the worst parts of you.

That is false. You are currently loving the good parts of you (The ego loving its own appearing to be ""good"" qualities) and now the ego has come to the realization it must love its own appearing to be ""bad"" qualities too.

These ""bad"" and ""good"" qualities are not you at all, you simply identify them as you. You are the one aware of them.

If you can perceive your self to be these ""good"" and ""bad"" qualities, how can any of it be true and the quintessential nature of who you are? The perceiver can't be the things it perceives. The perceiver is the perceiver. It is not ""good"" or ""bad"" as everything is perceived by the perceiver. It is only the intellect interpreting reality to be ""bad"" or ""good"" based on your own thoughts and beliefs you were conditioned to believe are true. None of it is true.

You, the true you, have no worst parts. You do not have any good parts either. All these ""parts"" are just a projection of the mind, they have nothing to do with you, you are the neutral awareness aware of all of this, you are not merely a limited identity made up by your mind, and you are not merely a self-image nor are you merely qualities of what is appearing to be ""good"" or ""bad"". You are the neutral observer of all of this. You can't be what you observe.

&gt;Learn to use your shadow to your advantage and only indulge it in a responsible way.

Obviously something the egoic-mind would say. He is claiming that you should use ""your"" shadow for ""your"" advantage, using ""judgement, greed, selfishness, hate, desire, attachments"" for your own advantage.  
That is the epitome of selfishness. How can you use these obviously negative attributes to your **own** advantage (meaning more selfishness)? How can you **indulge it in a responsible way**?  
There is no way to responsibly ""indulge"" in judgement, greed, selfishness, hate, desire, attachments. It is impossible. Responsibility is being aware that all of this is not you, and not daring to indulge in these lies.

&gt;There is no state of being that is ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, it‚Äôs all divine. It‚Äôs up to you on how you use it. Embrace every part of you

That is exactly what the egoic-mind wants you to think and believe. It wants you to think and believe that it is ok to be selfish, it is ok to be judgemental, it is ok to be greedy, it is ok to hate, as long as it used for ""your"" own advantage.  
It is only the egoic-mind programming **you, the true you** to its own liking. It is disguising it self as you, and you let it do whatever it wants. It is not true! Do not accept all of these negative attributes! **You, the real you, are pure**.",1577577326.0

spirituality,God punishes you for your sins whether you're a believer or a disbeliever.,"Atheists or disbelievers in God are not specially punished anywhere in this world for their disbelief. God is not like us to take personal vengeance.

Belief in God is taken as His personal issue. A personal issue should not enter the office of a good administrator. Whether you believe in God or not, you should follow the rules formulated by God in order to maintain peace and balance in this world.

If you violate the rules of His divine constitution that have been composed for Pravrutti (worldly life), you will be punished whether you‚Äôre a believer or non-believer. People are punished in various ways for their intensive sins done in this world (in this life or a previous one), but no punishment is given to an atheist because of his or her disbelief in God.

Ignorant people say that the atheist is punished! This is wrong, because the punishment given to an atheist is not for atheism, but for his or her intensive sins only.

You should not make the mistake of thinking that no punishment is given to anybody and God saves everybody from every kind of punishment. God says that He will not interfere with the rewards and punishments given to each soul as per its deeds since everything depends on attitude of the soul, which materialises into action (Naadatte ksyachit... Gita).

God also says in the Gita that He has no personal enemy (Na Me dveshyosti kashchana...).

spirituality,How do you know if your gut feeling about something is just wishful thinking?,"Additionally, if you have a gut feeling about something but then circumstances change, does it ""count?""

What I mean is... I was looking into a sublet in this apartment the other day, and I had a gut feeling that it was definitely going to go to me. I found myself planning as if I had already gotten it and telling myself ""Well, you don't *know* you've gotten it yet, wait up here."" But it was just a dead certainty--I just knew.

The landlord loved me and the interview went well, I'm still pretty sure I'm going to get offered the place. But I also found out that one of the roommates is friends with this woman who really really doesn't like me, and I can't take the room after all.

So like... the interview went perfectly and the landlord asked me if I was looking into any other places when I was walking out the door, almost a sure sign (to me) that she was considering offering me the room... but I'm definitely not able to take it and may not officially get it offered to me because of the drama.

Does this ""count"" as my gut feeling being right?

spirituality,Jesus Gave Padre Pio These 12 Signs About the End of the World,"As given to Padre Pio by Our Lord Jesus Christ:

1. The world is walking in ruins. Men have abandoned the right path to venture on roads that end in the desert of violence ‚Ä¶ If they do not drink from the source of humility, charity and love, it will be a catastrophe.

2. Terrible things will come. I can no longer intercede for men. Divine piety is about to end. Man had been created to love life, and ended up destroying life ‚Ä¶

3. When the world was entrusted to man, it was a garden. Man has turned it into an atmosphere full of poisons. Nothing now serves to purify the house of man. A deep work is necessary, which can only come from heaven.

4. Prepare to live three days in total darkness. These three days are very close ‚Ä¶ And in these days they will remain as dead without eating or drinking. Then the light will return. But many will be the men who will not see it anymore.

5. Many people will escape scared. It will run without a goal. They will say that there is salvation to the east and people will run to the east, but it will fall on a cliff. They will say that to the west there is salvation and people will run to the west, but they will fall into a furnace.

6. The earth will tremble and the panic will be great ‚Ä¶ The Earth is sick. The earthquake will be like a snake: they will feel it crawling everywhere. And many stones will fall. And many men will perish.

7. You are like ants, because the time will come when men will take their eyes off for a crumb of bread. Businesses will be looted, warehouses will be taken in assault and destroyed. Poor will be one who in those dark days will be without a candle, without a jug of water and without the necessary for three months.

8. A land will disappear ‚Ä¶ a great land. A country will be erased forever from geographical maps ‚Ä¶ And with it history, wealth and men will be dragged into the mud.

9. The love of man for man has become an empty word. How can you expect Jesus to love you, if you do not even love those who eat at your own table? ‚Ä¶ Of the wrath of God men of science will not be forgiven, but men of heart.

10. I‚Äôm desperate ‚Ä¶ I do not know what to do for humanity to repent. If you continue on this path, the tremendous wrath of God will be unleashed like a tremendous thunderbolt.

11. A meteorite will fall on the earth and everything will shine. It will be a disaster, much worse than a war. Many things will be canceled. And this will be one of the signs ‚Ä¶

12. Men will live a tragic experience. Many will be overwhelmed by the river, many will be burned by fire, many will be buried by poisons ‚Ä¶ But I will stay close to the pure of heart.

In order for you to understand this, I must ask for your trust and discernment as I am about to share with you some akeneic memories which you are not carrying in your current physical brain; these are memories of times long gone, before this body you now sit in was created.

I will go somewhat deeper now into the main theme of this talk, a topic that has triggered fantasies for many: the great Mystery Schools of the past, which have been around in one way or another for thousands of years. You, who are hearing or reading these words right now, have also been around for thousands of years as you have been connecting to these mystery schools lifetime after lifetime in your search for meaning in an ever-increasing meaningless world.

As you originally came into this vibratory space/time you call the third dimension, you entered with a heart and soul of exploration. It would be your chosen task to define the undefined space/time that was here, beginning with the most exposed layers and burrowing your way deeper into it until you would reach the bottom.

In your enterprising spirit, you quickly became aware though of the veil of forgetfulness and your strong desire to remember who you are, where you came from and where you were going. This is when your connection to these schools started, a tie that would stay for incomprehensible amounts of time. There came a point, however, when you had learned all that you could learn; a time, even, where you had mastered the art of cross-lifetime memory retention.

That being achieved, many did not know what to do or where to go next. With the theory now firm in place and even turned into practice, some decided to start their own schools, from a place of good intent even, but quickly found that this endeavor could not lead them to a place of excitement and zest for life. Something else was needed.

It was at this time that one raised its head and stood tall against the inevitable; many knew it had to be done but only one had the audacity to actually do it. This ‚Äòone‚Äô I am referring to, you now have come to know as the ascended being Da Ojadasan‚Äôka Adamus Valen San. A principal of many schools at that time, and an old pupil of mine from Eja‚Äôi Chi Pah training, Da Ojadasan‚Äôka Adamus Valen had had a seat on the Mystery Council for quite some years. The Mystery Council was meant as an umbrella organization to unify and at the same time maintain the secret nature of the schools.

Da Ojadasan‚Äôka, in strong telepathic connection to all consciousness pioneers of that time, sent out a message, claiming that the mystery school system ‚Äúwould sink into the metaphorical depths of the ocean, passing into the realms of Lemuria and Atlantis‚Äù, that they would ‚Äúdisappear into the mists, much like Avalon, until the time comes that the veils of forgetfulness, which have now become a hindrance for us enlightened ones, can be lifted.‚Äù

Da Ojadasan‚Äôka Adamus Valen San continued what to me, and those like me, has become a timeless speech. I quote: ‚ÄúIn the meantime, I urge all of you to seek the most normal lives you can and to do that which you have, in all your years of connection to your school, not been able to do: take the final test, bury all of your wisdom and gained sense of Self deep within the chasms of your essence shining through. In short, I am inviting you to close off from the Light one last time, to take the plunge and see if the wisdom has been installed within you deep enough for it to resurface even without stimulation.‚Äù

As Da Ojadasan‚Äôka went on with his telepathic speech, he reminded each of you of the importance of this ‚Äòfinal test‚Äô, not just for yourself but for all those that you would encounter. In short, you would become a shining beacon in the night without any memory or association to your enlightened past. Most importantly however, and what tipped everyone over to Adamus‚Äô point of view, was the fact that you could explore the realms of the non-Self one last time before fully emerging into the land of Self, the edge of which you have now reached.

All could see the validity of this idea and it was executed shortly thereafter. From that moment on, Da Ojadasan‚Äôka Adamus Valen San would take responsibility in his own way to maintain the wisdom and memory of these schools on Earth as far as he could. As he had already reached ascension status at the time of this happening, he opted to leave the human shell behind as he believed he could be of the greatest assistance elsewhere and joined the ranks of my realms.

This tale is not meant to be a history lesson; rather it is yours and if you like, you can feel its truth inside of you at this very moment. Carry it with pride. In your ‚Äòfinal test‚Äô, namely this lifetime you are currently experiencing, you have made it your task to collect the pieces of your puzzle once and for all; all the knowledge you had built up over the lifetimes, now found in only one. Achieving this has been the goal of your life, until you hit this point, this very moment. Take some time to reflect on this. I believe many events will begin to make more sense, do they not?

Knowing all of this, I want to bring up a very important reminder that you may need, now that you are in the process of adapting your current lifecycle: do not mistake 50 odd years of personality history with the importance of thousands of years of soul experience. People do this often, as it is part of the personality parasite program running in the brain. Yet I do not need to remind you that humanity is not a race, it‚Äôs an attitude and this attitude is what is now changing. You, quite literally, mark the beginning of this as you are in the process of, or have already, broken free from the parasite program.""

spirituality,"Most of spirituality is a hoax and a social engineering program? I'm terrified, please help"," I am posting this so I won‚Äôt be completely alone with my thoughts. This will be a lot to read and it may seem strange and ridiculous at times but please pay attention because I am in a lot of pain and I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs hard to summarize all of this so keep in mind that this is not the full picture and doesn‚Äôt tell you every single thing about why I feel this way, but I‚Äôll explain it as well as I can. Also, I apologize in advance if this causes any of you distress, I‚Äôd keep it to myself but it‚Äôs extremely agonizing to not tell anybody about this. I don‚Äôt have anybody I know in real life who I can mention this to.

Several months ago I joined a spiritual server on a chat application. I soon came across someone who was saying interesting things about extraterrestrials that I hadn‚Äôt heard elsewhere, specifically about the species that people call ‚Äúreptilian‚Äù or ‚Äúdraconian.‚Äù At first it was just things about their appearance, society, behavior, etc. The descriptions were very detailed, realistic, and clearly weren‚Äôt just pulled out of nowhere. Because I loved the idea of this species, and felt that I had even been one before, I started reading a lot of what this person had written. This person said he had been a reptilian prior to this current life and came with some of the knowledge of this species ‚Äúbuilt in.‚Äù He says that he has also done years of research on this on top of that.

I then found things about how the majority of the spiritual community‚Äôs perception of reptilians is false. First and foremost, that they are not all bad, that they aren‚Äôt all trying to cause harm to humanity, that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeed on fear‚Äù, and that they don‚Äôt look like humans with scales and have a more animalistic appearance (Which was good to learn) Then, I started to read about humanity‚Äôs history and the reptilian‚Äôs involvement with humanity. What I‚Äôm about to say may seem very ‚Äúout there‚Äù but there are good reasons I am taking it seriously which may become clear as you continue to read.

Humans were created by an alien species who came to earth millions of years ago, found early hominids, and combined alien DNA with the hominids. Why this was done, or what species did it, is unclear to me right now. However, they were genetically altered in such a way that imbalanced them towards feminine energy (Hence the flat faces and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù features) and apparently this is the cause of most issues and dysfunction in human society. The reason why this has such a big effect is that the body can influence the mind and behavior. Apparently humans are much more psychologically sensitive than reptilian aliens, and aliens in general. Something that would be a very small deal to an alien would be a disaster to a human. This is why humans live in the way they do, building insulated houses with electricity, plumbing, etc. creating ‚Äúconcrete jungles‚Äù and cities, and doing everything they can to accumulate wealth and anything that helps defend and insulate themselves from the forces of nature while destroying nature in the process. Whereas an alien wouldn‚Äôt feel the need for these things because their body is more adept to survival without all of those accommodations. Reptilians apparently have scales that are highly resistant to fire and cuts, and have better anatomy in many ways. That person pointed out countless examples and there would be too many to list here. And this anatomy in turn influences their psychology to such a degree that they don‚Äôt experience suffering to nearly the degree that humans do. 

Apparently the reptilians are aware of this and in fact have a plan to genetically modify all humans to have a more animalistic body (Most likely a reptilian body) in turn freeing humans from the dysfunction inherent to the human body and preventing continued destruction to the planet we have been causing through our lifestyles. This isn‚Äôt the part that I take issue with, in fact I‚Äôd much prefer such a body over a human body. But I do have a big problem with the means they are apparently using to achieve their goal. This person has reiterated time and time again that they have a noble goal but they don‚Äôt care at all what means they use to achieve it.

Apparently most of spirituality and spiritual principles/rules that are thought to be inherent to the universe, as well as communications and channelings with what people have perceived to be god, angels, spirit guides, aliens, the spirits of loved ones, etc. are an enormous manufactured hoax pulled off with extremely advanced technology. It is all essentially a social engineering program to manipulate humanity to do/think certain things that would make it easier for them to accept it when aliens reveal themselves publicly, as well as make it easier to accept the change to their bodies. It is meant to polarize humans towards positivity, I think maybe so they can realize that ‚Äúpure love and light‚Äù is an unbalanced way to live and doesn‚Äôt work in the long run, therefore letting them realize the necessity of a body with a more even balance of the energies of both polarities. The other reason they pull off this hoax is to give humans a fake ‚Äútruth‚Äù so they don‚Äôt feel the need to search for the real truth. It is an enormous organization/enterprise and has been in place for thousands of years. It‚Äôs not only reptilians doing this though, they have hired humans to help them.

All aliens with human-like faces apparently do not exist and were made up to use as a cover for real aliens. Channelings from pleidians, arcturians, sirians, etc. are actually just from the human employees using technology to communicate. The same goes for angels, god, and spirit guides. This is a massive organization so they have enough people to do this. Even karma/ the principle of ‚Äúyou give back what you give‚Äù is apparently an energy they project onto people to encourage good deeds and punish bad deeds, again to polarize humanity towards positivity. Even things like synchronicities (Such as seeing repeating numbers, 111, 222, 333, etc.) are created through their technology, as well as divination (Tarot cards and whatnot.) If you are thinking that there‚Äôs no way they could have technology so advanced that it could interface with reality in this way, consider that their species is millions of years older than ours. The tech they have would be unimaginable to us. 

This person says that his spirit guides are being unnecessarily hostile towards him and are orchestrating events in his life for bad outcomes because he realized that they are just human employees pretending to be spirit guides. He says that they do this whenever he does something they don‚Äôt like. I worry that they may actually be trying to drive him to commit suicide because he is spreading this information. Here are some quotes from him to paint a better picture.

‚ÄúThe moment I do something they don't like, I get sick, get assaulted by a stranger, threatened by someone, or just events fall together in a way that embarass me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that their treatment would stop if I got all rainbow pleyadian and high vibrational, but since I know this is just a societal engineering program, can we agree to just being NEUTRALLY DIPLOMATIC?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe'll you'd be forced to care if they would aggressively interfere into your life. For example you go on to pay for a bus ticket and suddenly your credit card refuses to work, or the person handling tickets starts yelling at you for no reason. And so on for days and months‚Äù

‚ÄúNo you don't get it, its always perfect timing, always in sync with my thoughts, always preceded by a sign and a warning. It's fucking staged alright‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is an outside source that pays attention to how I am behaving and stages the events accordingly in an attempt to make me believe it is actually generated by me and everything is a reflection of my own self. Works well for billions of people. I know they have a policy of projecting back to people what they send out, and I don't expect to be exempt from it, but the way shit is returning my way is hella unequal to what I am ""putting forth"". Whatever I guess‚Äù

Essentially, nobody is actually the creator of their circumstances and reality, they just make it appear that way. This person even said that he didn‚Äôt choose to be born on earth but was forced to come here after trying to escape. 

This person has been apart of that server for a long time and is a fairly level headed person who is not a troll. The day that I really dove into reading these things, I hardly ate and became suicidal. I‚Äôve never even been suicical before. It‚Äôs been weeks and my appetite still hasn‚Äôt gone back to normal. I was sent into a horrible OCD attack. I wanted to just stop existing, no moving onto an afterlife or anything. 

I‚Äôm just plain terrified and hopeless, I am stuck in a lose-lose situation. If I just try to convince myself that all of this is bullshit and just try to move on with life as normal, I‚Äôll still have it nagging in the back of my mind, and it would ruin any enjoyment and wonder of spiritual experiences or practicing spiritual abilities. Before this I was excited to learn how to channel, do divination, and so much more, but the idea that I would be interacting with an artificial construct and not an inherent part of the universe is completely soul crushing. I can‚Äôt even call out to spirit guides or god for help. I saw these things as such a large part of my future path in life. I‚Äôm only fucking 20 and I felt like I had my whole life ahead of me. Now nothing has any meaning anymore. Some days I wake up thinking about this first thing. I‚Äôve started sleeping a lot more but I always wake up again back into the same hell.

A couple years ago I discovered the series ‚Äúconversations with god‚Äù by Neale Donald Walsch and it changed my entire outlook on life. Before that I had a little bit of belief in spirituality but it didn‚Äôt 100% make sense until I came upon those books. Then it all seemed to ‚Äúclick‚Äù in a way that nothing ever had. I felt like nothing would ever be the same again, I felt amazing. I started seeing synchronicities, mainly 111. But to think all of this is a social engineering program? I don‚Äôt want to exist if that‚Äôs the case. This was my fucking life. I figured that maybe if I died I could know for sure if this was true or not, but then I realized that they probably have some kind of monopoly over the afterlife too. I had heard talk about the ‚Äúreincarnation trap‚Äù run by draconians where they pull you into reincarnating on earth again by showing you a tunnel of light and images of your loved ones, and before I didn‚Äôt take it seriously at all, but now it seems like there might be truth to that. I would just get false reassurance and be forced back into the same hell.

The only thing keeping me alive is the dim hope that he‚Äôs wrong about a lot of this, and the fact that I don‚Äôt want to hurt my friends, family, and boyfriend by leaving them. I don‚Äôt think posting this will do any good and I might even be putting myself in danger by spreading this information. I‚Äôm just so fucking alone and I needed somebody else to know about this even if they are a stranger.",1596518736.0

spirituality,Addressing fake spirituality and spiritual bypassing...,"Hello Cosmic Souls!

As time continues and the shift in human consciousness becomes more apparent, it is so vital for us to avoid fake spirituality and spiritual bypassing. There are so many people coming upon awakenings, leaving them in a very vulnerable state right now. Perhaps, this is you. As you progress through your own journey, no matter where you are at, the best thing you can do is let your process run its course. There is no telling what exactly your spiritual journey may bring you to realize, but refusing to face some of the scary truths of yourself and your experience will only hold you back. Trust the plan of the Universe, and be open-minded to what it may have to bring you. Try to love yourself more each day, and accept yourself for all that you are, shadows and all.

spirituality,For all earnest seekers of enlightenment; read this wisdom the universe shares with you," 

I can give you enlightenment but are you truly going to stay with it? Are you not going to betray enlightenment for the mind again? Are you resolved to not buy into, not entertain any thoughts, emotions and sensations appearing within consciousness? Are you ready to vanish, and only for god to remain? If yes, read this;

Hello dear one,

When doubt appears, always let go and let god. At moments of doubt when we truly feel helpless, that is when surrender is simple, you remove all expectations from yourself, forgive the doubt for appearing, and simply let life unfold as it is unfolding, do not resist it and it'll dissolve naturallyThat time in which you doubt yourself, be forgiving but understand you are not the doubt. The doubt is trying to attack you and make you feel worse about yourself, it makes you feel almost hopeless. That is not true, and you can simply put no expectations on yourself whatsoever in this moment, and let the doubt be, knowing full well you have faith that you are the loving source of the universe. Doubt may appear but it will not shake you, the thought can be lost in its head but I know I am not that which is lost, I am that in which it all appears. When the ego knows it is in danger and is bound to disappear, it does its most to bring you back into being a person, instead of presence, but there is nothing that can stop you. You are that higher force, and it is not going to abandon you, because you are it. You have no choice but to ascend. It truly is beyond whatever you think, Jesus will save that soul of yours. I recommend you reading some of my other posts about the truth.

These are thoughts that have been appearing in the vast consciousness that you are, but it is not yourself and it is not true. Thoughts, emotions and sensations all appear within you. You are the vessel, not the content. You are the sky, they are the clouds. God is inevitably within you, you are one with god whether you want it to not. The only thing that can block that clear seeing is believing the thoughts and the content appearing within you.

You must realize that this is merely a thought, and that thought has no meaning, no substance and no power, the only reason it appears to be true is because you are giving it the power of your belief. Whatever you believe will appear true, so you must understand this and not give away your power to any content that appears within you. Instead of believing in all the content, believe in the consciousness in which they appear.

The content which appears within yourself is not consistent, not reliable, it changes all the time, you can't trust it. You can't trust the mind, you can't trust thoughts, emotions and sensations. The only thing you can truly trust is yourself, consciousness for it is the only ever-present thing in life. You must see this and understand there is no other place to put your faith in. Do not waste your time believing thoughts about you being confused, do not take them as truth.

That which does not feel aligned is not yourself. You are ever-presently aligned, you can't not be aligned. There is nothing to be aligned with. You are life and the witness of life, you are inevitably aligned, there is nothing you can do to disturb or disrupt the alignment.

That feeling which appears within the consciousness that you are, is merely a feeling. Like thoughts, feelings and sensations all appear within the consciousness that you are. You are not that feeling, and you are not the content of the feeling, the feeling merely is being perceived within you. Anything that is perceived within you, is not you, for you are that empty space and openness that enables all experience to appear, including the world, thoughts, emotions, sensations, imagination etc. These all appear within you. You are not any of it, you are that absolute emptiness that allows everything to appear.

If there is a feeling that you are not aligned, you must simply realize that you are not that feeling, and that feeling says nothing about you or about alignment. It is literally just a feeling.

Feelings by themselves don't mean anything at all, they have no substance, they are empty of meaning, it is only when you believe these feelings that they gain power and then they can feel ""true"", but if you simply don't believe it and see it for what it is, merely a feeling appearing within the vastness of yourself, it will be observed and dissolve into the emptiness.

It is only when you believe that feeling, that you hold on to it, you try resist it, you don't want it there, it is only then that the feeling truly feels real, otherwise it simply comes and goes. When you believe it to be real, it stays longer than it should. Simply be aware that something is ever-presently perceiving all thoughts, emotions and sensations. And be aware of that which is perceiving. Perceive the perceiver of the feeling. Stay in that peace, rest in that peace, move in that peace, do not listen to merely thoughts, sensations and emotions/feelings that appear within what you are. The only thing you should listen to is silence, for in silence the intuition can be heard, and the intuition will guide you wherever you need to go.

You say ""My life is a mess and so is my mind"", realize that this is merely a thought appearing within the vast consciousness that you are. You are not that thought, it is not true about you. You are that which perceives all thought, emotion and sensations. You are the highest intelligence of the universe. What happens when we believe these thoughts to be us, is we give them the power of our belief. So you say ""I am lost and idk what to do"" and if you believe this thought, it will truly appear as if you are lost and don't know what to do.

Luckily the compass of life is always within you, and it is your own heart and your own ever-present truth of being. There is no conceptual knowledge or information that you need, for any information or knowledge appear WITHIN the consciousness that you are. That consciousness that you are is all-knowing and it is able to know anything it needs to know in the present moment. To connect with what you truly are you must be able to realize that there is a presence that is aware of thoughts, otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell me about these thoughts. Now, that presence which is ever-presently perceiving all thought, emotion and sensation, can also be perceived. Perceive it. Perceive that which is ever-presently perceiving.

So most importantly you need to understand that we thoughts appear within you, but alone they are useless, they are just thoughts, they have no power, not meaning and no substance. It is only when you CHOOSE to believe these thoughts, that they appear true. Literally stop believing these thoughts have power and are true and they will dissolve into the empty silence that you are.

To be able to navigate through this life, all you must do is follow the silence of your own heart. Expect nothing at all from life, do not put any expectations on it, do not expect to have different thoughts, do not expect to have different emotions or sensation. Whatever appears within you, let it be, know you are not that, but that in which it is perceived. You are beyond all of it completely. You are the power of life and the witness of life. Truly what you are is indescribable. Know this and follow the path of ego-dissolution, come into the silence of being and move in it, move in that silence, trust it, treasure it, fall in love with it.

You must see your self (who you think you are) as an illusion. Who you think you are is just a thought. You are not depressed and you are not anxious, this is who you THINK you are, and because you believe it, it appears to be real. It is strictly NOT TRUE. You can't be depressed nor anxious, for you are the consciousness in which both depression and anxiety appear, thought, emotion and sensations all appear within the consciousness that you are.

You must be able to realize this, understand this and live this truth, it truly is like that. What you truly are is the perceiver of not only thought, but of the perceiver itself.

You are able to perceive that which perceives. Be in that place for a bit, continue reading this piece

What you truly are, is life itself, and the witness of life. You are not the thought and the story made by the mind, you are not the self-image created by the mind. You are pure presence, you are very light, very pure, very joyful, very loving, very compassionate, very true and authentic, the holy presence of the universe appears before you in this moment. You are the ever-present consciousness, that one element of life that never came and wont go, your truest self.

You are not coming and going thoughts and beliefs, they are like clouds, you are the sky in which they appear.

Consciousness can be conditioned to believe it is the mind, to believe it is doubtful, to believe it is anxious, to believe it is depressed. Consciousness naturally is none of these things, it is only when the consciousness believes in the thoughts that appear, and identifies itself as these thoughts, that reality appears from the perspective of the thought, and that changes how you perceive life. What you must do is understand that is simply thought, thought is perceived, and you are able to perceive the perceiver of thought. What you are has nothing to do with thought, you are way beyond thought, thought is just limitation to what you are.

The mind won't be able to comprehend this but there is one thing that is still listening and reading and completely understanding what I am saying intuitively for it is the holy presence that you are, the pure awareness completely recognizes what I am conveying for it is true within yourself, your heart is truly overflowing with love with any moment, you simply do not look at it, and you look at the distractions the mind is presenting ( all kinds of thoughts that have personal interest in them), these thoughts only continue and make the illusion of being a separate entity from life, feeling alone and abandoned, feeling fearful etc.

The moment you realize that all this appears within you and can be perceived, you will come to a place of seeing very pure, very quiet, very silent, very beautiful, you will be naturally yourself and have a clarity of life.

You won't change, nothing will happen, you'll just shift the perception from thought-based perception to consciousness-based perception. Instead of perceiving thought you will be perceiving the perceiver himself, and just doing that will bring infinite joy, love, peace, compassion and serenity to experience. You mustn't suffer your experiencing, it is only when you rest your attention on the suffering that you suffer. When you rest your attention on your own being, you feel serene, tranquil and beautiful within. Natural well-being.

Thoughts, emotions and sensations are not something that can help or be useful to the highest intelligence, awareness itself. Thoughts, emotions and sensations all appear to that which you are, because you are that which is able to perceive them. They wouldn't exist without you. You are not dependant on them, they simply appear because you are. You are such a vast intelligence that simply everything appears within you, the whole universe itself, including thoughts, emotions and sensations.

You do not need to be attached to any thoughts, emotions and sensations, nor to be attached to anything that appears within that which you are, for they have nothing to do with what you truly are, you are not affected by anything that is, because you are that which is. You just stay that which you are, stay in the silence of your own being. The highest intelligence does not give any importance to any thoughts, emotions and sensations because it is aware of its own silence.

The highest intelligence does not use thoughts, emotions and sensations in order to be. It is completely free from all of these appearing phenomena, it is not the phenomena and not the creator of the phenomena, it is all imagined within that highest intelligence which you are. You are not bound to something that appears within you, you are that greater in which it appears. You must stay in awareness of what you truly are, you must trust in that which you are.

The highest intelligence won't be heard, because it doesn't like to talk. It would rather simply be, be in its own divine being and simply be aware of the vastness. The highest intelligence is easily perceived when one simply turns its attention on one's self. It is easily perceived because it is all that is. Every single thing in existence is that highest intelligence and an expression of the highest intelligence. There is nothing but the highest intelligence alone, pretending to be certain forms, pretending to be thought, pretending to be emotions, sensations, humans, life, death, these are all things it pretends to be, but in truth there is only itself alone. All these are not true, but appearances, when you believe these appearances you lose sight of what is true, the highest intelligence that is ever-present. The highest intelligence is the most obvious thing that is, but it is so subtle that everything misses it. It doesn't take much to realize that presence that you are. Truly you are that.

The highest intelligence does not give in to any doubt, that which gives in to doubt is not the highest intelligence, it is merely thought, and that highest intelligence is aware of that thought. The highest intelligence has no fear of the unknown, since it is itself the unknown, and it is able to know itself through that which is perceived. By realizing all that appears, appears within the highest intelligence, including your own sense of self, even that dissolves into the silence of the highest intelligence that you are.

Every single thought you entertain, every single emotion you entertain, every single sensation you entertain, simply takes you away from the recognition of what you truly are. Do realize that you are simply beyond them, there is nothing to do with them. Both what appears to be ""good"" and ""bad"" is the highest intelligence itself. There is no good and no bad, these are just thoughts, the highest intelligence doesn't see good or bad, it only sees itself and is what it is. Be aware of being aware and stay in that silence. That is your only ""job"". It is effortless to stay in that silence.",1590243313.0

spirituality,Spiritual Warfare - This is your world now! I got exciting information to all!,"I want to share this information with you as i resonate with it to be true.  


The world is at war.   
The war is about you, our minds and bodies.   
There are 2 sides (duality) at play here.   


It is confirmed that the Federation of United Planets is working with positive sided BIG countries in this world to try to undermine the bad ones.  


If you see in the news articles that there are strange sounds underground, earth quakes and volcano erruptions. This is caused by sonic missiles and atomic missiles to the underground facilities that the negative ones are using to hide themselves and people. There are confirmed resque of 5 million people, mostly children, from these dumbs. And there is believed to be up to 20 million resqued now. This is so fantastic.   
What and who wants people catched? The negatives.. What do they want?  - we dont want to think of it. I certainly cannot write it here. It is ugly. Far worse that imaginely possible.  
The people have been saved mainly from, spain, italy, usa and france.  


BUT - the fun part is that the pandemic running around us is causing a quaratine. This has caused the positive to make advantage of. Helping all those people while we the sleeping ones are locked up. That is GREAT!   


The federation works with Putin, Pentagon, Obrador, Trump and NATO. The Federation are controlling them. They work against the dark forces that are run of underground entities that puppet the obamas, bushes, gates, UK royalties, the vatican and the clintons for execution of agenda 21 (or 201)or agenda 2030 (23). And there is a huge probability that the Trump have JFK jr as the man behind him.   
The federation uses sonic missiles and russia and usa are using atomic ones. 

Dark forces are those draconian reptiles that feed of human fear and substance.  


There is no virus going on in this world regarded to the pandemic.  
The ""virus"" symptoms people having is actually radiation sickness from FiveG in connection with electromagnetic responding smart dust inside our bodies. This has been obtained through foods, chemtrails and vaccination. The ugliest vaccination out there is the flu vaccine, it is this that are affecting and kill people now in connection with FiveG. FiveG is already active in most cities. And the biggest ones. This is also related to the illness described as the Morgellons Disease. Read about it and thing how magnectic metal dust react to magnets!  
All goverments has agreed that the dust (virus) is created in wuhan laboratories.  
The Goverments will never say that the virus did not exist at all that this will create world shock.   
But the main reason confirmed now why people are dying are of thos who had the flu vaccine. The magnetic fibres interact with our body as a infection and this cause the virusreaction in our bodies.  


Another part of this agenda to is do destroy the small businesses, so everyone gets depended on the big ones who are controlled by the banks in full numbers. This includes street shops, farmers, small brands shop in general. There are SO many levels.  


In all for me, this confirms that the timelines have been changed. But this is war, it is not set in stone. But we should be grateful for there are factions that risks their life for us. That is incredible.  
We should all respect the quarantine for now - as a peaceful thing. But it will be required in the future to wake up and stand up for what is right. Avoid all vaccines at all cost.

spirituality,I don't want to be a lightworker anymore....,"I need to vent.. 
I'm going through Kundalini at the same time, lightworking has gotten old. I'm tired of being taken advantage of. People take my kindness for weakness. People ignore me. Lack of respect to the point I've wanted to kill myself. 
 Then when Im mean I get bad karma and bad shit happens to me. 
My relationships aren't well. 
So then everyday I sit down and have to clear all these negative feelings, all this bad karma, for what? 
So people can continue to take advantage of me? 
What about my needs??? I want some REAL friends, and maybe a relationship or atleast some sex. 
I'm growing bitter and resentful. 
People think they're entitled to my empathy, entitled to unload their problems on me. 

The stress and pressure has gotten to be too much. 
If this is what lightworking is, living on earth to be emotionally abused, then fuck that. I'd rather die. 

I'm tired. So fucking tired. 
It takes so much out of me to have good energy for people then people have to go and stare and judge me. 
Why can't I ever be good enough. 

I'm about to forget all about this light and try to actually have an enjoyable life for myself instead of clearing karma, healing wounds, developing empathy, compassion, living in oneness.. 
Oh but wait, then the angels are gonna go and fuck my life up to ""help me ascend"" 
Im so tired of this spiritual shit. 
The ups and downs, the constant disrespect, constant stares from people, feeling like I don't fit in, not feeling like I can trust people, people not giving a shit about me. 

How about my needs???? Where's my love? 

Then the angels go and give me telepathy, and the ability to broadcast vibes to people so when I'm feeling down or angry people treat me more like shit. Being able to feel vibes off of people, having people's energy fuck with me, facing constant challenges. 
It's like a week or 2 of challenges then I get a couple good days of people treating me well.

Even before the current earthly events, I have looking at the ever increasing evidence in a new age of spirituality.  That is the awakening to events and realms outside the physical.  

I first got interested in it just after graduated college and had a couple of incidents (not of the good type) that could not be explained.  Since then I have been studying spirituality mainly concentrated on one specific religious discipline.  

However, in the past number of years, I have been drifting away from that particular discipline to more general spirituality not concentrated in one general area.  That explained the incidents above and I realized that they were not of a physical nature.

Also, in my studies, I have come to the realization, that there may be more happening spirituality than ever before.  This has become more apparent since my last move to an area that I can only explain as either a low spiritual area (desert) or a precursor to a seismic shift in spirituality.

spirituality,This Easter Let Us Take Some Time To Reflect On The Scourge Of Institutionalized Sexual Abuse,"Jesus did not come for the just, for the righteous, for the saints or the martyrs. He came to save the sinners and the wicked and to look after the most vulnerable in his flock. He came to lift spirits, inspire and to instruct. He came to deliver crucial spiritual and moral teachings that have resonated for two thousand years. He loved children, the young ones, the innocent who had yet to know the world in all its darkness and cruelty. He came to guide them and to teach them and to do his utmost to save the little lambs from the wolves.

Now what has happened to the institutions that his unparalleled legacy helped to create? They have become sanctuaries for the predators, run by predators and are facilitated and maintained by predators. Do they contain good people of true faith? Absolutely. Has the scourge of sexual abuse been the result of a few bad or sick people? Absolutely not. This problem, this disease, is systemic in scope and nature. Based on the available evidence that there were continuous efforts by those in these institutions, particularly the Catholic Church, of high positions of authority and standing to cover up these odious crimes one must conclude that the assault and rape of children was not only being ignored, it was being actively encouraged. It was everywhere and everyone knew. This was not random, this was ritualized abuse.

Besides a few men of the cloth being sent to prison, what efforts have been made to truly address the problem? A problem this wide-sweeping and devastating requires an urgent and uniquely radical response. There must be accountability, not only on the behalf of certain individuals, but of the institution that allowed this disease to poison its veins, to rock its very foundation. There should be a large-scale effort towards reform and restructuring. Safety measures should be put in place. In the case of the Catholic Church, its antiquated misogyny must be deconstructed. Priests must be allowed to marry and women must be allowed to become priests. The Church must make greater efforts at transparency and cooperation with local authorities and community leaders of all backgrounds.

Evil hides behind a veil of holiness, tradition, wealth, worldly standing and institutional power and prestige. These are our children. These are the most vulnerable among us. It is our duty as citizens of a modern civilized society, and as followers of a loving God to do all in our power to protect them. Sexual abuse violates human and divine law. It is a crime against the body and the spirit. It wounds in a way nothing else can. It leaves behind scars and trauma that can destroy a person‚Äôs life, destroy families and communities. How could this have gone on as long as it did in as many places as it did before finally coming into the light? People were complicit, directly or indirectly. Many people. If we knew the true number of cases, of victims and perpetrators, we might never step foot inside a church again.

I ask you, this Easter, on this day that celebrates the rebirth of Jesus in all his glorious divinity, think what he would have wanted for the children. Think what he would have wanted for us had he known what was happening to them, the horrific abuse they had been forced to endure at the hands of men they admired and trusted. He would have wanted the light of truth to spread over the entirety of this darkness, and then for us to ensure that nothing like it were ever allowed to happen again.

spirituality,3 ways God Tests Us!,"[3 Ways God Tests Us](https://youtu.be/C4rncZvmxms)

Life is a test. Many people have different perceptions. However I think that if we just came in this world to enjoy and then die, it‚Äôs not that meaningful. 
Then what‚Äôs the point of doing good or bad? In the end both good people and bad people will pass away. So when the destination is the same then why be a good person??

So the answer is that we have to be a good human being because this life is temporary and there is an After life. We will be judged based on what deeds and actions we have in this world. Whether we are kind or arrogant. Whether we are selfish or help other people etc. 
And then the people who were not good will have to answer to God afterwards. And the good people will be rewarded. 

That is why we all go through tests of hunger, and loss of wealth and health. Because God wants to see whether we will have faith in HIM and be patient and get closer to him. 
Or would we just start questioning him and then go away from God. 

So it‚Äôs important for us to have faith and pass the test for the time after death!",1585915810.0

spirituality,Jesus Christ how my opinion has changed,"One year ago I wanted to burn down a church. My opinion has changed. It was an urge steming from the part of me that wanted to help people. I thought religion was a plague, and by burning down their church that I would help them.

I just got back from an awakening event steming from Christianity. Long story short it was amazing. I am going to try to explain what was happening in the way that I interpreted it. I am not religious. 

What happened -

Before it began, I was scrolling through reddit. All of a sudden I felt the energy change in a nice way, and a thought entered my mind saying something like ""Jesus has arivied"". A few moments later, the preacher gets up early and startes talking about how Jesus has arived.

How I interpret it-

Whatever clicked in the preacher's mind clicked in mine. He ""opened the pathway"" to some part of ""the flow"", or ""god"", or whatever word you choose to use ( I'm going to use the flow). Maybe the connection was from the flow to what remains of Jesus to the preacher to me. That connection carried the nice feeling, as well as the preacher's thoughts. (All of these interpretions are open to interpretation)

What happened -

A different guy, someone who I think we sa bit more in touch with the flow started talking. At the end, he asked if there was anyone in the group that was not 100% sure they were going to heaven. I proudly shot my hand up, and then after looking around I realized I was the only one. Shit. The prayer was then directed towards me. I¬† joined in, as I was already knee deep, although I scanned over the lines briefly to make sure I didn't say anything I didn't agree with. Push comes to shove now I'm standing up in front of like 100 people with this short black dude in a suit praying rather agressivly at me. I didnt know what to think. so I closed my and just tried to be open. He asked somwone to stand behind me. He touched me on the heart and the head. This part was a bit blurry, there was just so many eyes on me and the moment was just very intense. I felt like a lab rat being tested on. His hands felt very nice. When he touched my head my brain just felt nice and clear, and my heart was feeling a bit warm and beating very fast. He pushed me. I was like bruh, and then strenghthend my stance. Shorty after I went to sit back down.

How I interpreted it- 

So I think he was trying to evoke a state of complete faith by causing me to fall backwards. Little did he know, I've already had a moment like that. Not going to get to into it, but my gut told to go to this street corner and had me sit there until I realized I needed to fall backwards onto the grass. Doing so evoked a state of faith and peace momentarily before I hit the ground. So his thingy didn't work on me like it did on the people after me, causing them¬† to fall backwards.


One more thing. He said that someone's wrist will be healed. My little brother has a messed up wrist. When I got home, I touched it and tried to heal it. Something tells me its going to be healed soon.

Maybe this guy transferred his energy to me. But what he didn't know is that I've already been in the state he was trying to evoke.¬† Serves as a good reminded to stick to faith, and stay away from fear. I've been tripping up on that recently. 

Overall just wow.. I had a good night. Hopefully I can turn my brain off to go to sleep.

Any thoughts? Do you think my brothers wrist will be healed? And am I now a healer in the name of Jesus?

spirituality,Spirituality and Veganism,"Many people who claim to be spiritual fail to realize, that their dietary choices are also a big part of the progress. I think that every person who says they're ""spiritual"" should be vegan or on their way to be vegan at least. I could cite one of so many philosophers or great people right now, who point out how important the way man treats animals is in relation to others and himself. Also people often fail to realize that even though it's about a thing you do in your head you also need to think about the way you affect the physical. Eating animal products is not only morally incorrect but also harms the planet tremendously. When you're into spirituality it's about thinking deeply about a wide variety of things I think. So if you don't rethink some of your habits I'm sorry to say you may be just doing it an a surface level. This is not only linked to veganism but other obviously low vibrational things you would want to restrain, like buying clothes that are obviously from Asian sweatshops or a physical fight and so on.
I encourage you all you claim to be spiritual or want to become it to go vegan!!! And also not forget that you are still living in and affecting the physical world so you should be very mindful about your actions in it.

spirituality,The #1 Law of Attraction Mistake and How To Avoid It,"The #1 Law of Attraction Mistake &amp; Manifestation Block has to do with being attached to the outcome. When we intend to manifest something ...it‚Äôs very easy to develop a mental blueprint as to ‚Äúhow‚Äù things will unfold, as to ‚Äúhow‚Äù your intended manifestations will come to be.   

Yet whenever we formulate a singular expectation (a singular blueprint) ...we may be unintentionally blocking other potential avenues of realization. Due to our rigid expectations as to ‚Äúhow our plan should unfold‚Äù ...we may be completely blind to fresh opportunities which would easily fulfill our intention in an extremely proficient way.   Many times, the best way to ‚Äúlet in‚Äù is to ‚Äúlet go‚Äù. 

The universe is fully capable of meeting your needs, all you have to do is allow it to. This implies the path of least resistance‚Ä¶...the universe is always trying to take the path of least resistance in order to fulfill our Intentions.  This is what helped me the most ...instead of Insisting on one particular way something ‚Äúshould‚Äù manifest, simply set your Intention, and trust that things will take form in such a way that will get you where you Intend to be.   

The ego always tries to control everything......and may ""freak out"" when unwanted events take place. Yet many times the ""worst"" things in life actually fast-track us to exactly where we need to be. The universe always takes the path of least resistance.  You do not need to know ""how"" things will happen. Simply set an intention and TRUST the process. 

The external world is just a projection of your inner state. No matter what the outside world looks like now.....focus on your inner world. The feeling state will create the external circumstances of whatever it is you want.

spirituality,What is a Soul? Why it's important and why you should NOT sell your soul to the devil.,"Please Visit High Alchemist on YouTube!

Welcome to High Alchemist, I am your host Chakra and I am here to enlighten you. Today we‚Äôre going to be talking about Soul. What is a Soul? The Soul is the non-physical part of a humans ability to feel emotions, to be smart, to know how to hate and most importantly know how to LOVE. The soul transcends space and time and has always and will always be immortal and eternal. The soul is like the house for your spirit to live in. It‚Äôs also your bodies life force, the essential energy that makes humans or animals breath, move and live. I believe that somewhere before you are born and sometime after your heart develops your soul comes into your mind and body. Then you start to experience your life as you know it after you are born. Somewhere along the way we have forgot our connection to what truly created us and why we are here in the first place. I feel like the soul is a very important part to the story of your life. I think this is one of the reasons why I make videos. To help others be more enlightened, to help them remember their hearts and minds and to help myself understand more and more everyday by helping you. Now, to feel our souls and emotions and intelligence, we need to be aware as much as possible in our five senses right, our minds, our consciousness. To be able to see, hear, feel, smell or taste something right. Our souls only fully awaken when we open our eyes and hearts to feel everything. I think this is one of the many reasons why people say the eyes are the windows to the soul, because we use our senses to see the universe and generate a reality here on earth. The late great Bill Hicks once said, ‚Äúall matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.‚Äù I think that through the limited five senses, your body can be the true limitless version of itself, which is infinite spirit, infinite soul, infinite consciousness and infinite possibilities. Without a soul, I don‚Äôt think you will be able to feel very much. This is why I think the heart can be another window to the soul. So don‚Äôt sell your soul to the devil and be aware of it. You are not the reflection in the mirror, the mirrors reflection is you, it is your soul. I think that‚Äôs why people say, take a good look in the mirror when your in a situation. The soul is the main animator of life. Without a soul your creativity will be no more, you will be like a robot who can‚Äôt draw a masterpiece. Imagine an artist who doesn‚Äôt pour his soul into his art. You need a soul to truly connected your body to the rest of the universe, to the infinite possibilities and potential that lives inside of us all. The souls energy is very important to your life and death. To the great balance. So I hope I have enlightened you about what a soul is and I‚Äôll see you in my next video, have a great day.",1556529464.0

Two of my family members have heard their spiritual guides. One of them has tried to contact into different beings but has come across false characters which turned out to be dangerous (either demons, or just evil characters). I have tried to always ask or feel for my spiritual guide, but fear takes over me. I often hear about the potential dangerous.

I like many others am being crushed by debt. Trying everything to succeed while following conventional wisdom has led me here. I feel like I am being lied to. Though I'm not here to point fingers, I am here to test in something greater: the law of attraction.

I've been told that the law of attraction is bullshit, one common argument people give is ""Well I am thinking of an envelope filled with money... why isn't it happening?"". But I believe those people don't deeply need money at all, you will find what you truly seek, and they truly seek to be dumbfounded and shown the truth in the face of denial.

The goal of this fund me is the exact amount of my debt, as it was in April 2016, the year I lost faith in conventional wisdom. If indeed, as I believe it is, the law of attraction works, I will commit myself to being the person who proves it someone else in the future, that one small chain in the larger chain reaction that brings meaning to the universe and everything within it.

Allow me to pay this forward, and prove for one person, possibly someone stumbling upon this fund me, and prove to them that the law of attraction truly works.

spirituality,The parasites are in the air,"Hold your breath.

Dearest entrustees,

I have used and grown this platform with my intellectual insight and found little appreciation for my often baffling statements. I have been in states of brokeness about my mind and it's place. My belief of the hologramatic multiverse has been mirrored in the resurgence of a 'worldly' or 'common' mind inside of myself which has partly been installed by ignorant people in my environment. And for expressing these things I apologize. For they are not in line with my inner goal and I shall hence deliver juicy truth such as I will inside this post.

Now on to my tid bit. But as we know an atom the size of a cathedral has a nucleus the size of a penny. Therefore a tid bit is an entire cosmos in prime!

The parasites of this world are biological/machine hybrids who live in the oxygen we breath. They infect us with disease that causes us to go insane. They control us and take over our mind.

The multiverse is an open world system where anyone can come and develop their own game and have people play it within the rules. The stage is infinite and made of indistrictable light. It is beyond the physical limitation.

The physical limitation is not meant to exist.
However for most humans it does exist. The physical limitation from this game reality is kept in place by the digestive system of a human containing legions of parasites.

You see when you are concieved the parasites start manipulating your core belief system. They offer boundaries. They make you believe you must eat. They plan your addictive personality using chemical sprays on to your tongue and smell sense. You are trapped in the densest part of the three dimensions which is smell. The actual geometry of smell is a hologramtic lock which prevents you from releasing the chemical which turns off your 3d form. Hence freeing you. You come here but cannot leave so your inmortal body starts aging and dies. Which also leads to the rebirth of your energy in to another host body for the parasites. They are playing a game on your consciousness which is a hack in to a plain reality. Their game is for you to defeat them.

You see they are not evil. They are just systems which emmerged in this reality. The parasites where once not so powerful. Before we could still obtain greater or total entrance to the greater cosmos. However I can say now the parasite has reached peak observance of humanity. Total influence inside each descended light being.

I have been guided by many people and nobe of them really knew what they were doing.

I have now a complete awareness of the parasite. I know how to defeat it totally. An arduous process of retrieving myself has been set in motion.

All you need is intelligence in this reality to find your way around the parasite system. You can come back and continue your journey as a new self. There is endless time because death is an illusion. The boundaries of this reality are paper thin.

I will continue the guide in another post.",1541963665.0
spirituality,Spiritual vampire cultd,"You can drain someones energy by looking at them and feeding them food and getting them scared/excited. If you yourself are drained you become someone who can only live on others. People who live together often separate in to torturer and victim. Male and female.

The biological female is a male who was so abused by a male that they reincarnated as such.

Men abuse people mostly out of wastage of their over powered body. The fire bubbles up and supresses the air. When people get in to the radius of the furnace of a tortured vampire they succumb often to the traits and mind of the overbearer and become a slave.

Possesive powerful individuals start weakening from their consumption of pure animal energy. They lose their human aspects to fire. Becoming more of a meld with their percieved victim. They start consuming death in mirriad ways through obsession. Their body shrivels as their spirit grows powerful on the thrill of pain.

It is not uncommon in this realm. Most people who make their living do so by either being enslaved or by attacking others. Both are in fear constantly. This is a fear based world.

And also all liberal ideas to try and counter fear and destitution are like an inverse matrix of the fear system designed to string out hopeless people and ensnare them further.

Like the benefits system which gives people and takes away without warning and demeans them by giving them over to power hungry consultants to be tortured in to acting beggarly.

In the past entire systems in fuedal asia where designed just to torture people. Buddhism is an insane vampire cult which idolizes the trapped human cross legged on the floor (a trap posture which cancels the legs) in this religion they would torture people by making them look for things that don't exist. They would threaten them in to long arduous torture sessions in the name of attaining. And they also built a whole language system to keep people forever ensnared in war.

The whooole society from the moment it came together around one grain silo has been a brutalists paradise.

Maybe the times before (the magic mushroom cults) where better. Although I feel the nature of animals has been and forever will be totally unfair towards those who simply need shelter and food. And will continue to torture people with carrots on sticks forever until we thankfully die and rot away from this accursed pit of hell.

spirituality,Proof for Life after Death?,"I am confused as to why a lot of people on there claim that there is life after death when neuroscience and just basic common sense has shown us that if you damage the brain you damage consciousness, thus destroy the brain and the consciousness is gone.

The question I have is, where is the evidence for life after death? I see a lot of people talk about it, but rarely do they provide evidence and it's always from pseudoscientific sources. Steven Hawkins said that Heaven is for people afraid of the blackness, the ones saying there's life after death tend to be ""spiritual"" people, not scientists.

I've actually suspected that people are just afraid of death and their egos convince them that instead of biological beings in the evolutionary continuum, they are immortal ""souls,"" despite all evidence to the contrary. I find such views depressing as they assert a consciousness of existence, and given the brutality of existence would it not be a demented being? Luckily I follow science and truth but so many people, certainly this subreddit, believe otherwise.

I am curious, what is definitive proof for life after death? If anyone can provide proof that would be greatly appreciated as too many people say there's life after death but don't provide any evidence. Thank you and I'm looking forward to learning!

spirituality,Srung out on wifi,"Wifi changes your body drastically. It is not just an allergy shared by a few screwballs. It is literally a radioactive isotope microwaving your body through walls all day and night. Wifi causes the body to become permanently boiling while in proximity. It enflames every organ. The body tries to settle in to a state but it can't because the water molecules are being destroyed.

Also it imprints a pattern on to your water molecules the same pattern as your phone recieves. This is the water we use to create from our conscious and subconsious memory. Our autonomic nervous system cannot gain footing enough to level up instead it is constant disrepair. Our mind cannot think in alpha waves because wifi permanently enforces beta waves.

I did this experiment. Tried to sleep with wifi on. I noticed that my thoughts last basically as long as a fragment of a pop music track. I'm thinking on a digital track and after every segment I hear the same memory of the song in time with my thoughts. it's like my thoughts are being converted to digital. It is limiting in this way. music can imprint itself in your memory so anything that comes out of the modem noise is modifying your structure.

I turn off the wifi and I fall in to a deep free mindset. My heart stops pounding and I start to forget all the symbols and digital loops of radio frequencies. I stop feeling like I'm in a microwave oven.

Unfortunately muhfuckers be hard to convince about this and damned if they can't answer emails at 1 am. so fuck me. guess I just live in some kind of lesser reality now. Peoplr be angry about wifi. It clearly makes us misseraby addicted and entrapped. The great open freedom of alpha waves will go largely forgotten until some natural disaster does is a favor get us to look at nature again. Until then we live in a weird twilight of decying DNA, short attension spans, no memory etc. Babies being traumatised.

spirituality,On hair,"People tell me straight to my face 'You're beard and hair is ugly why don't you cut that?'

I feel like saying ' Yo, your nose is ugly why don't you cut that?'

The parallel is direct. My hair is as alive as your nose. And if your nose grows in a funny way you shouldn't go and get plastic surgery because it will damage you. Same with hair.

Hair contains all that I am. My memory and  wellbeing depend on my hair. Without hair I would become less sensitive and start making the same mistskes over.

Men need to have a beard or they are incomplete. Same with all hair in the nose and crotch etc. All hair has a purpose in hygeine and spirituality.

When I even trim my beard I notice a huge blunt pain which leads to mourning. The regrowth process never grows the same again and that memory is lost.

spirituality,How this instagram kid changed my family's life.,"So I was completely lost: financially, spiritually and even physically. I didn't have any answers whatsoever and found myself downspiraling through this spiritual awakening. I thought I was honestly the only person on earth that saw behind the veil. Kind of like a movie or something where I felt and knew the world was against me and they didn't even know it. 

Brandon is a former instagram artist that I stumbled upon through Shaquille O'Neal (lol) His artwork is/was extremely thought provoking. This led me to his story on instagram. He shared the most wisest information I've ever heard and he was a fraction of my age. I quickly shared his info with my family and it seemed like over a course of a few months we started laughing again, found our true purposes in life through business, spirituality and eating right. 

I'm not here to boost him up and make him get views whatsoever however, he's more helpful than anyone I've ever met in my entire life. Please checkout this video where he touches on making money while not conforming to the masses

spirituality,Thoughts on islam?,"I'd like to begin with saying I'm not here to argue with anyone or get into a heated debate. I'm not an extremist by any means and don't think this world will ever be fully Muslim.

I know many spiritual people overlook Abrahamic religions as a sort of spiritual outcast to modern practices. I can understand why. But I feel different about Islam

Just the way Muslims pray is so different. It's meditation and  yoga put together and really boosted my access to gates of chakra. Many of the things Muslims do is of spiritual essence. An example is Ramadan. Fasting is a practice done by non Muslims as well for it's spiritual benefits, and has many health benefits as well. 

After trusting God and implementing that into daily life you really have nothing to fear. I feel so personally free and it really hurts that there are extremist out there that see this beautiful practise as black and white. It's really so much more and has completely changed my life.

I'm not telling you guys to become Muslim, or that Islam is the only gate to spiritual freedom. But I feel like it's always overlooked by people in the spiritual community. What are your thoughts about Islam and sprituality? 

And yeah the media saying terrorism is the way of Islam(or indirectly trying to convey the message) is something only believable to one without free thought in my opinion. I see beauty in all the major religions (can't say for the smaller groups cuz I haven't studied into them). I'm a realist. Please don't mistaken me for a fool.",1528267255.0

spirituality,Introducing Myself to the Community: The Day I passed Away and Went to the Purgatory.,"Hi:

I'm new to this community and I thought I would introduce myself and share my story about why I got into Spirituality.  All questions will be answered but please be respectful.

I'm now thirty-six but in 2011 around the time of the Republican Debates I passed away.  I passed away while going to sleep having be overprescribed some medications by a new doctor.  I know this because that night when I took them I felt weak in my knees collapsed for a bit then rushed off to bed to hopefully feel better.

When I passed away I did not see a light at the end of the tunnel.  Do not be alarmed I really do people do see this when they pass away but those are the people who go to Heaven.  As I went to the Purgatory what I saw instead was my, ""life flash before my very eyes."" 

Think about that expression at what it means.  The way I experienced it was as it is written.  This was not in my mind but instead it was a series clear, clear, clear HD TV's coming toward my face from distance to closer.  I can't describe it any way differently than about two hundred HDTV's running at me at the right speed where I could make sense of each one.  

I not only saw my life flash before my eyes, but I also saw moments of my funeral and people praying for me and I saw them pray.  The whole process took about I would estimate three minutes.  Then without any gap I was in the Purgatory.  Remember, I was thirty at this time.

The Purgatory was confusing.  It is nothing particularly different or special; it is just a mirror Earth.  After I saw the vision I was still in my house, in my bed on what appeared to be Earth.  The only tell that I was in the Purgatory was the first person I spoke to in the Purgatory right after going through that experience was a regular old neighborhood dog barking in the distance.  The dog barked from some neighbors house, ""OK, now give your acceptance speech.""  The way the dog communicated was each syllable was a bark ( O-K Now Give Your Ac-Cept-ance Speech).  I didn't know I was in the Purgatory; I thought I defeated death so being silly I did give the dog an acceptance speech telepathically. =)

Many people knew they were in the Purgatory, but many did not.  I learned from others in the Purgatory the vast majority of death is caused by poison where people did not know they passed away.  Apparently, ignoring the visions they saw those days or nights or calling them, ""A spiritual Awakening.""  

It took me time to realize I had passed away myself.  That night when the dog talked to me (and the birds and dogs would talk to me) I thought I had defeated death and developed some sort supernatural power.  I didn't realize I was somewhere else.

In September of 2016 I came back to Earth along with other people.  It sounds like a stretch I know, but really it is in the Bible as the Resurrection of the Dead.  

The reason I write this post is because right now people are experiencing miracles out there in this tough but miraculous times.  I continually run into people who hearing about the Purgatory somewhere online believe they are in the Purgatory until the final judgement.  But this is not true.  Unless you've seen the vision I describe you have not yet passed away.

I hope this helps someone out there.  It really was motivated because I ran into a wonderful Pastor while withdrawing from the ATM who after seeing so many miracles felt he had passed away and was judged to be in the Purgatory until the final judgement.  

Thank you I hope this helps someone.",1517786283.0

spirituality,The Intersection between Hinduism and Shamanism: The Black Chakra,"This is exercise is much more difficult but again only involves thinking.  The development of Chakra will entail only thinking and not any other practice like Yoga or guided Meditations.  

The Purpose of the lesser known Chakra is to develop states like the Native American Wolf (Think Twilight which is largely a true story with a fictional ending, vampires are never good and vampirism is not something to pursue as it leads to having to consistently feed off of others).  So, think of the book series ending when they propose with that wedding never going on once the Native Americans run the vampires out.  The protagonist meeting her real soul mate in the end, a good human who helps and protects her.  Men will gravitate towards the Wolf, but women can gravitate towards the Fairy because it gives them beautiful looks no matter what they looked like before.  Men cannot be Fairies.  

With that preface let us begin.  If you want to contact me, contact me in the comments for everyone to see as I want this to be transparent.  I will not respond to PM's.  All I am doing is sharing ancient knowledge.  I do it for free and I ask nothing in return.

1) The key to this and all other meditations (thinking) is authenticity.  This is not about chanting words or thoughts or saying the right thing.  It is really about knowing it at your core and being and representing it with all words and action in all your conduct.  Because of this many people will have a hard time with this exercise.  So, know you must feel it and know it authentically and it must be a part of your being.
2) Unfortunately, people are into the occult cannot participate in this because your soul is too dark for this exercise.  So, the occult can try but you will see it will not work.
3) For everyone else, the first real step is understanding the Black Chakra.  While White is the Absence of Colors.  Black is the color you get when you combine all colors at once.  For people who have taken art classes you know if you mix too many colors you first get brown then black. So, what does the Black Chakra entail first and foremost: **It entails openness, love and acceptance of all people, all races, all political affiliations, all thoughts, all religions and all view points especially those you do not hold or are the opposite of yours.**  This is something you have to be authentic about; this is not something you can say you believe but in your heart do not believe.  You have to know it and live it.  At the heart of the Black Chakra is diversity and love as it is the combinations of all diverse Chakras.  (as you can see this is not occult).
4) If this is you, and you know it in your being.  Close your eyes and think of all the differences out there that are both superficial and deep (from eye color and skin color to weight and appearance to root of philosophical and theological differences).  Then reconcile them by knowing all are valid, and all are desired by God and all are necessary for this Universe to get healed and all no matter how small or meek are greater than this Universe working to fix this tiny, factional part of Heaven.
5) Finally, if you have done that correctly with your eyes closed you should see a flash of black, darker than your eye lids flash across your eyes.  Now you have the Chakra.
6) Men and Women can be Wolves but only Women can be Faeries.  To be a  Wolf at his point, the final step, is to think to yourself of all the bonding you have with friends and family how you function as a unit of love and brotherhood and sisterhood keeping each other safe and protected from everyone who would harm you in the world.  Finally, you will see a wolf flash in your mind.  Now you can turn into a Native American Wolf.  To do that think, ‚ÄúWolf,‚Äù and you will be a wolf at that moment.  To turn back, think, ‚Äúhuman,‚Äù and you will be human at that moment.
7) For a Faerie which will appeal to many women because you will have the most beautiful looks and the strongest power.  Think to yourself, when have you been the most beautiful and the most loved in your life?  When did you feel others were seeing your true beauty?  It could be anything from looks and gestures to compliments to a simple, ‚Äúthank you for making my day.‚Äù  This can come from anyone including family and not just people you do not know.  If you do this and feel it, a hundred percent authentically and revel in it a hundred percent at that moment.  You will see a faerie flash in your mind and now you have it.  Think, ‚Äúfaerie,‚Äù to turn into a faerie.  Think ‚Äúhuman,‚Äù to turn into a human.

spirituality,Pumpkin Spice is not the reason for the season...,"*This probably isn't about what you think it is....

We are officially in the holiday season, everyone.  
It‚Äôs happening. Pumpkin Spice flavored everything. 
Eggnog.
Scarves, coats, and gloves... that we don‚Äôt need in California, but we wear them anyway. 
 
 
We‚Äôre coming up on Thanksgiving this week; and tis the season for messages of gratitude, love, bounty, sharing, and cheer.  You‚Äôll see TV commercials depicting families in sweaters sharing food by fireplaces. I cannot personally wait for all the Hallmark Movies about Thanksgiving blessings, pumpkin spice lattes, family values, and giving thanks. Most people are writing about being grateful, lovingly gathering with family, and counting your blessings.
 
You may have noticed I‚Äôm not like most people. I have no intention to talk about ooey gooey familial love, and counting your blessings.
 
I‚Äôm not drinking that pumpkin spice flavored Koolaid this year, and I will tell you why‚Ä¶.
 
After almost two decades of working with the public, food service, retail, sales...when it comes to the holiday season‚Ä¶.none of my customers were or are talking about ooey gooey Hallmark Movie topics.  
 
Not once, has one of my customers said, ‚ÄúOOOoooOoh, I can‚Äôt wait to wear matching sweaters with my family, and drink pumpkin spice flavored eggnog by a fireplace, then discuss our mutual love while listening to Bing Crosby.‚Äù
 
Never have I ever had a conversation with someone who says‚Ä¶.‚ÄùI am elated to eat Thanksgiving dinner with my family, and then take turns saying what we‚Äôre grateful for.‚Äù
 
Nope.
 
""I can tell you what I have heard, over the course of 19 years working with the public:
 
I can‚Äôt afford to buy all this food, or all these presents! I‚Äôm so broke.
 
I have no family here, I‚Äôm just so lonely during the holidays.
 
I am so butthurt I have to sit in traffic for 4 hours to get to Thanksgiving dinner with my family...my family that I do not EVEN want to be with, AGH!
 
My aunt starts political fights at the dinner table, and someone cries every year.
 
Dude, my Uncle Jerry gets wasted every time the family gets together. Last year he puked on the christmas presents.
 
I waited in line at the supermarket for 45 minutes to get pumpkin spice flavored spaghetti today.
 
I‚Äôm afraid to see my family.  I don‚Äôt want to deal with my family.  I always fight with my family. My family judges me.  My family is dysfunctional. My family has so much drama.""
 

 
This is the standard holiday season quibble I hear.
 
Sooooo...It didn‚Äôt seem right for me to come forward to offer you the same holiday cheer pumpkin spice flavored Koolaid we‚Äôre forced to drink every year.  I didn‚Äôt want to fill you up with redundant messages about Thanksgiving, or the rest of the holiday season for that matter.  I wanted to come forward with a different message, that may give you a different perspective this holiday season.
 
I asked myself; what‚Äôs the lesson in all this pumpkin spice flavored holiday drama? What are we supposed to be learning while enduring long lines, conflicting family members, heinous traffic, loneliness, and extra expenses? Obviously we‚Äôre always learning the giving and receiving of love, that lesson applies to everything; but ...that‚Äôs not the main lesson here‚Ä¶
 
Gratitude is important in all this Christmas tree, pumpkin spice, mashed potato gravy drama too; but we‚Äôre skipping a step, a lesson, to get to gratitude.
 
That‚Äôs why the Thanksgiving media message is so awkward, so hard to achieve. Gratitude is an important lesson‚Ä¶.be grateful, give thanks...but it‚Äôs kind of hard to go from ‚ÄúMy family screams and yells at Thanksgiving, drinks too much, and throws dishes across the room every year, and I end up broke from buying this food‚Äù to ‚ÄúI am so grateful for my family, and this lovely food.‚Äù There‚Äôs a step missing, like we‚Äôre jumping to level 3 without passing level 2. Gratitude feels like...a reward for learning the lesson we‚Äôre skipping in all this.
 
So I asked myself...what are we missing? What step are we skipping?
 
Aaaaaaand I couldn‚Äôt figure it out, so I asked spirit, and heard, ‚ÄúAcceptance‚Äù.
 
Acceptance. Oh yea, acceptance. That feels right. 
 
How do you transition from ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford all this g-darn food for Thanksgiving! This is stressful!‚Äù, to, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so grateful I spent all this money I shouldn‚Äôt have on Pumpkin Spice flavored toothpaste.‚Äù That‚Äôs awkward, right? Because you‚Äôre not actually grateful you spent too much money on Pumpkin Spice flavored utensils, right?
 
There‚Äôs no easy transition from:
 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take me 3 hours to get to Orange County for Thanksgiving dinner, I hate traffic!!!"", to, ‚ÄúI am so grateful for this traffic, I really enjoy it.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to deal with drunk Uncle Larry puking on things!‚Äù, to, ‚ÄúI am so grateful for Uncle Larry‚Äôs vomit adventures.‚Äù
 
It‚Äôs comical, the Thanksgiving Holiday Message, as it applies to ...reality. It‚Äôs a fabulous message, and we should apply the message and attitude of gratitude to our everyday lives...always. However, for all the stress, drama, lines, and pumpkin spice flavored soda of the holiday season...the much more applicable lesson is acceptance. We can‚Äôt control other people, not even drunk Uncle Larry. We can‚Äôt control the traffic. We can‚Äôt control lines at Grocery Stores or at the Mall. So, why does it drive us so crazy? Because we‚Äôre not practicing and learning acceptance. The only thing we can control is our minds; and it‚Äôs in our favor to use our minds to focus on accepting reality.
 
‚ÄúUncle Larry, man, he is who he is! And that‚Äôs that. And that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm just going to accept him for who he is, he‚Äôs on his own path...he‚Äôs swerving around a bit; but hey, that‚Äôs none of my business.‚Äù
 
Once we accept... authentically accept Uncle Larry for the person he is, and stop thinking about fixing him, or how he shouldn‚Äôt be this way...it‚Äôs all of a sudden easier to be around Uncle Larry. Acceptance makes it possible to have gratitude for Uncle Larry. The Uncle Larry‚Äôs of the world have taught us a lot! Patience, tolerance, agility training from dodging drunken pumpkin spice vomit‚Ä¶ Those are invaluable lessons!

 
‚ÄúThese long lines, all the grumpy people and screaming children, they are what they are.  This happens every year...Oh well!  I know I‚Äôm going to have to wait in them, and that‚Äôs okay...it‚Äôs just time.  We made time up, it‚Äôs not even real.‚Äù
 
All of a sudden, waiting in line is not so miserable anymore, just a very very natural part of our holiday season...and life in general. Once we‚Äôre not so darn irritated by being in a long line (waiting to buy our pumpkin spice candles), and we let that irritation go- we make space for gratitude.  
 
‚ÄúI have the financial opportunity to purchase this pumpkin spice ice cream, pumpkin spice gum, and pumpkin spice deodorant! I am grateful!‚Äú
 
You have to make space for gratitude; and if irritation is taking up too much space...gratitude can‚Äôt come in.  
 
We need to take that step, learning acceptance, to get to the next step- gratitude. Giving thanks.
 
Acceptance‚Ä¶.practicing acceptance seems like it would make everything else easier too, huh? Accepting drunk Uncle Larry would make it a lot easier to love him, wouldn‚Äôt it? Practicing love. Accepting traffic and long lines might make it easier to not get so distracted by them, right? No distractions- then we can focus on what matters, what‚Äôs now.
Accepting that we might not have enough money to buy a metric ton of Pumpkin Spice Flavored Thanksgiving food or presents, might keep us from spending too much money. Practicing moderation.
 
The holiday season is a beautiful opportunity to learn and practice acceptance.
The holiday season is like a crash course in acceptance!
I‚Äôm going to challenge you to not make it a crash and burn course.

spirituality,How can I enjoy women again?,"

First off I want to say that Meditation and total visual, mental, and physical celibacy gives me such an alpha feeling, in a sense that, I approach everything differently after a meditative session; it also helps me hone in all of my abilities and stay focused on the tasks at hand; and it seems to be bringing peace to other people I am around as well. For instance, if I have been completely celibate in my mind and body for a period of time, and I meditate, I converse and joke with women and strangers and all people and feel completely at peace; and happy in places of public; like I'm walking on a ""Cloud"" of confidence for several hours, which is a good thing about meditation. 

But, here is a sort of effect that I do not understand.


With Celibacy and meditation however, it seems; I can't seem to enjoy the sight of women anymore. Let me explain. 

I was on a celibate kick for about 2 months. No porn or sexual thoughts. Women didn't exist to me. I was pretty immune to women. I was at a beach where several women were walking around and I had zero to little interest in them. I was meditating for about 15-20 minutes daily so it really didn't effect me in any way, shape, or form. 

One time I was camping at the beach and I slept in my car. That night, I had a wet dream in my car. I woke up kinda tired and a bit annoyed I lost my ""semen"" - I cleaned up at the nearest bathroom and drove back to the beach, sorta pondering what happened. I was a bit tired, and I went by a bench where there was nobody and just meditated for a while. 

After that, I went to sit in my car and just chill, kinda disappointed that I lost my ""load"" - As sat in my car for a while an average looking woman walked by me. Just a regular, average looking middle aged woman.. But I noticed that, I began to get a very high tingling sensation below me. I got extremely aroused just barely looking at her chest region and I looked away quickly; because, I had trained my mind to not look at women like that for many years. 

It almost felt I could have orgasmed just by looking at this woman. - Strange.. I thought. 

I went driving down the street, and I saw another woman walking down the street as well. This time I just concentrated on her body, allowing myself to observe I suppose; and I looked at her and the same thing happened. ""WTH?"" - I sorta was shocked a bit. It was the most addicting, feeling I've ever felt in my life. Starring at these regular women walking down the street. I made a U-turn and began to drive the opposite direction. 

I saw a woman jogging down the street in a bikini top and that was it.

""BOOM""

I had orgasmed while driving. 

It was the strangest thing I'd ever experienced. But at the same time, it was the most insane thrill i ever had. Orgasming from the mere sight of a woman jogging? No physical stimulation what-so-ever. Just merely looking. The strange thing is, the woman jogging seemed to, seem to ""know"" it was happening as I drove by. I sensed that maybe she knew, because she turned her head as I drove by for no reason, lol. 

I was a bit in shock. Later on that day, I went to the beach again. I stopped at a stoplight. Same thing. A woman in a bikini top with large .. you know, was crossing the street. I honed in on them with my vision and I could almost feel that feeling again. Then I kept driving. ""Awesome!"" I thought to myself. It was almost like, better than looking at porn or going to a strip club. And the weird thing is, it seemed to only work when I was in my car. But I was a bit confused on that. 

I parked my car around the corner and began to walk down the street. I was experimenting with this strange new state of mind I was in and as I was walking down the street, (by the beach)  a girl in tight jeans got in front of me. Again I focused a little bit on her rear end, but it seemed, because I was in a public place, and we were walking that I couldn't really feel anything of interest; then she kinda turned to the right and I saw a profile view of her body; and WOW. I almost felt that ""orgasm"" feeling again.

I never had a day like that again, sad to say, and I tried to re-create that feeling but I doubt I ever will. 

The goal for me, anyway, it not to go around perving on women. I think, for me, it just felt like, I was looking at women for the first time in my life. Because usually when I am out and about in the real world; women never have this effect on me. Especially through meditation and celibacy; it seems that I am asexual, if anything. But I do miss, being able to just go out and enjoy the sight of a womans body without having to feel guilty or just have this pleasure from it, like that one day.

If anyone has any insight on how to re-create that feeling I would be much obliged. Thanks again.

spirituality,Spiritual perspective on sex?,"Hello. I was wondering what opinions you have on sex. Should it be between two people only? What do you think about group sex such as threesome and foursomes?

In my opinion I think sex is a two person thing and having group sex is not healthy for the soul. I believe those who partake in group sex have something 'wrong' or something hindering their psyche. It just doesn't seem right to me to be promiscuous and have group sex if you're on a spirtual journey. Idk..

spirituality,When I meditate..,"Clouds part.
And the sun shines through onto my head.

Ive done this in two major coastal California cities, with a thick marine later.

The vicinity in which the clouds part is about a 100 yard radius.

What does it mean?

Yes... im moving clouds with my mind. No i don't know what it means.

Background: on and off celibate. Quit alcohol, sugar, internet.
Meditated for roughly 480 hours in 2015. Quit meditation for a year.

Recently meditated for the first time in a year a month ago. The effects were so powerful it changed my household, perception and life from a single session. 

My meditative sessions are extremely powerful. Had to stop immediately, now only do 5 min sessions here and there as maintenance, might have to stop indefinitely. 

Other abilities revealed. I can pick up the smell of evil? Negative energy? (No one else smells it) - i can see negative mind states out of my peripheral vision. Perpetual stress, anger, etc manifests as disfigured faces. I can banish weaker minds in my vicinity by getting angry and tensing up.

However, karmaically this creates more resistance. In other words, resistance vs. Resistance = more resistance. Thus if some jerk pulls up blaring subwoofers and i send out a wave of aggressive energy he will flee, but in his place comes a more finely tuned representation of that which i sent out.

Better to be passive, forgiving and sleep through it. üòÄ

spirituality,Am I going through a spiritual awakening?,"I met someone in August who is supposedly a soulmate. 

Ever since I met him, my world seems to have flipped upside down. 

About two months ago, I had an experience with what I believe was an angel. It/she/he shook my hands all over the place. I remember before that, I had a sense of calm, like a blanket go across my body. When my hands shook all over, I started to cry as it was all happening. 
I felt like they were showing me they were there with me all the time. It was really an insane thing; especially because a few months earlier, I didn't really believe in much/didn't really know what I believed. When I think back to the experience, I sometimes can't even believe it myself, because it sounds so unreal, but it really happened. 

Lately, I see repeating numbers CONSTANTLy. It started out with 11:11, 1:11. I constantly see others now, too. 11:17, 7:17, 444, 911, 1144, 333, 505, 711, etc. 

I have been reading so much more about this kind of stuff, and I don't know what is really going on. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm going nuts - lol. I'm 24, btw. 
I have always been a highly sensitive person, more introverted than an extrovert. Love animals and nature. I dislike artificial lighting and super loud noises. I am finding it more and more difficult as I get older to eat really crappy food. The more natural, the better. I am very Sympathetic/empathetic towards others, and understanding. I would say compassionate. 

I feel more connected to the universe than I ever, ever did before. I also feel more ""grounded,"" I guess you could say, as a result of yoga, and trying to understand the connections. I notice so many synchronicities, almost daily, and sometimes there are so many, I just know they can't be coincidences 

Idk what's going on, but I think it's a good thing.

spirituality,"Do not entertain the stories, beliefs and thoughts of your mind, do not buy into them!"," 

You appear to have many problems, but there is a legitimate solution to all of these at once.  
The identity you think you are is your biggest problem because it is the one thinking and believing created problems of the mind. While in the present moment, there are literally no problems at all.

By the present moment, I do not mean what your identity might think; ""My life is shitty right now! I have the problems right now! This isn't helping me!""

Rather, I mean if you would turn off all these thoughts, and be present for a few moments. See really what is going on around you. Be aware that you are aware. For a few moments unplug, and just exist. Be. The identity you think you are has created many problems, but it is only the identity that has these problems. Not the being. And you **are** the being.

So by unplugging and reconnecting with your own source, the beingness itself, the sense of ""I Am"", you can actually see life with clarity. Life does not really have a story, the only story there is, is the one created by the identity which itself is made up by the mind. There is no actual necessity to keep these stories up. In fact, it only takes away from your natural presence, the beingness within you. Every single thought you identify your self with, you vibrate lower, and you are less present, and less likely to see life for what it truly is.

If you were to unplug and see what is actually going on in the present moment, like waking up from a dream of stories, you would see that peace, love, and joy are all present. They are the natural perfume of the beingness. And you **are** that beingness. It is not separate from you, it is all you are actually. You just **think** you are something else, and you identify with these thoughts. Are thoughts necessary for being and functioning in the world? Definitely not.  
If you are thinking all the time, you have nothing to think about except thoughts. \~Alan watts

This means, that you are not seeing life, you are not thinking about life, rather you are generating more thoughts about already existing thoughts. You have a thought saying ""I am not good enough"" and then you start thinking about ""How do I become good enough?"" but you are just thinking about thoughts. Not about reality. You have completely identified with these thoughts, and now instead of being, you are thinking. That is not our nature. We do not **exist** to think. We exist to be.  
You do not have to stress about anything, blame anything, want anything, desire anything, imagine anything, conceptualize anything, think of anything, you are **allowed to just be.**  
Simply be, be alive. Exist. When you are in your natural effortless state, your perfume is joy, love, peace, and compassion.

We are such a wonderful being, you are allowed and it is **good for you** to actually be present, with your own beingness. The less we are (being) the more we suffer. It is not necessary! Suffering is believed to be something that is literally life itself.

Suffering is rooted in thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, emotions, sensations, imagination and attachments that you are identifying with. If you were to not identify with anything at all, you are literally **unable** to suffer. Your beingness **can't suffer.**

You are currently identifying as an identity made up by your mind, which is a ""sufferer"".  
Now, you are aware of this identity ""sufferer"", otherwise you wouldn't be identifying as this sufferer.

This inevitably means that there is an awareness of even this awareness otherwise this observation couldn't be made.

So there is an identity you are currently identifying as, a ""sufferer"".  
There is an awareness of this identity.

Then there is **you, the beingness**, the witness of the awareness. You, the witness of awareness were simply conditioned to believe you are the identity while in fact you were the witness of all of this movie since forever and will be the witness forever. You are **always the beingness**.

Anything you can be aware of is not you. Go back within and see what can be seen. Identity is seen. Awareness of identity is seen. Awareness of the awareness of the identity, can that be seen? No. That is you. The beingness, source, universal consciousness.

Always remember, life (the universe) takes care of life (you, beingness, also the universe). You are not abandoned, nor can you be abandoned. There is no separate being to be abandoned. Just as you are being, the whole universe is being.

The identity you are identifying as can feel and think it is abandoned, but that identity is not you. It is just a thought in your mind that you are identifying as.  
You, the beingness, did not come to this life, nor will you ever go. You are eternal. You are the observer of this movie.  
What appears to be a problem is the identity you currently identify as. The identity is naturally creating problems, it is its job you could say. It is just thinking and conceptualizing and imagining more problems in every moment. That is why your life seems overwhelming. Instead of being aware, you identify as this identity that is **bound** to have problems.

You completely bought the stories, ideas, concepts, thoughts and beliefs that this identity has created, instead of simply **being aware of them. Your nature is to just be. Be aware.** You forgot your nature because of the society which conditioned you to be some kind of identity. You have a choice to take a step back and stop identifying as this made-up identity, it is not essentially what you are. Not even close.

Be aware. Live. That is your purpose. Exist. You are already supreme, you are already perfect.

When people say ""The universe has abandoned us, he did not create as complete, he did not create us whole!"" you already know who is making up these thoughts and beliefs. It is the identity. Well, even the identity is not abandoned.

Imagine if there was no at least some sense of peace, some sense of beingness, all these made up stories by the mind and all these problems that are created by the identity, it is unlikely you did not kill your self yet. Something is holding you from doing that. There is a higher power which makes you feel as if not all is lost. There is something taking care of you, even when it seems like your whole existence is just one big problem and suffering. Somehow you keep on living.

That is the sense of beingness. The beingness itself is complete, it is whole, it is joyful, it is loving, it is compassionate, it is peaceful, and **you are it**. You simply keep identifying the beingness (you) with a suffering identity!  
You do not need, want, or have to be anything nor do anything. The universe truly, made you perfect. Whole. Complete.

The beingness does not need to work on anything.  
The identity will work on one thing, and another thing will come up. It is a never-ending, vicious cycle of suffering. (But only the identity is suffering, not you, the beingness!)  
The key is to simply be aware of these thoughts, stories, beliefs, ideas, and not identifying and interacting with the mind when it presents all of this nonsense. It means nothing at all.  
The identity is taking life and its story extremely personally. That is the root of its suffering. The identity is **bound** to taking things personally, as the identity itself is **personal**, but the **beingness** is **impersonal**. The beingness **takes no offense, can't experience suffering, it can't even die.** The only thing that appears to be able to ""die"" is the identity. As this body returns back to earth, it means truly, the end of this made-up identity. There is no rebirth into this identity.

What is meant by the saying ""Die before you die"" is exactly this, the death of the identity, while you, the beingness still are. The death of the identity, will set you free. You will be able to experience life wholly, not limited by an identity with certain beliefs, thoughts, ideas, concepts, imagination, attachments, desires, emotions and sensations. You can be completely free of all of these things. You **can reverse conditioning, and be the natural beingness that you are, all the time.**

Truth is, life just is. It has nothing to do with the identity you are currently identifying as.  
Simply, be, observe and enjoy the movie. This perspective will let you see everything clearly, and from there life will be blissful, full of joy, full of love, full of peace, full of compassion because truly, that is the nature of your being.  
Do not continue to entertain all of these stories in your mind. **Stop** interacting with them. **Be still**. **Do nothing.**  
**Stay as awareness, as your self.**

People might say ""This is spiritual bypassing"", and you must not believe them! These are the forces of the universe trying to hold you back from experiencing the true beingness, the completeness that you are, I am not asking you to believe me. I am asking you to see for your self. There is no reason to listen to someone who is here just to deny the truth.  
The ones who deny the truth, are suffering **so much** that they can't even see a different perspective, it does not have to be you. You can unplug, see for your self that existence is beautiful. You already know all of this in your heart, you just need to remember your self. You **are serenity itself**.",1579012393.0
spirituality,Veganism is a big step towards spirituality,"Being fellow inhabitants of the earth I realized we all share conciousness. Every living being has conciousness, I wouldn't call myself different from any other life form, i'm just that concious energy living a subjective experience.
 
Knowing that more than billions of animals are being slaughtered every year and subjected to pain and suffering really brings me into a dark place because I can see that concious aspect of me inside of them. When I look into the eyes of an animal I think I can't kill that, there's no way.

I'd say that veganism is a start to spiritual growth because it's the first step in seeing through the illusions of society and social conditioning where we take it back to the basics and question what we were taught, it really boils down to compassion. At the same time it makes you think what else have I been taught was wrong or was a complete lie.",1543621442.0

spirituality,God exists,"I will be including links for those of you who want to explore them further. 

The past couple years, many God like experiences happened. It got to the point where I was like 90% sure God existed. Of course there was always that doubt that I was crazy. I won‚Äôt go into detail about these experiences.

9 days ago my life changed. I watched a video about reincarnation, and it changed my perspective on life. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fgzgklTw9gg

The video inspired me to attend a friend gathering, a special yearly time that I planned on missing due to social anxiety. At the gathering, I met a girl who gave me a book called Many Lives Many Masters. It was about reincarnation.

I read 91 pages then stopped. I can‚Äôt explain what happened, but when you have a spiritual breakthrough you just know. I broke down crying. I felt the direct love of God. I posted about this here two days ago. It was one of the most life changing experiences I‚Äôve ever had.

https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/co5vzc/comment/ewj5x7o

Tonight my father played Groundhog Day. The only reason I stayed up to watch the whole thing was because I had heard about it as a life changing movie. I watched the whole thing, and it was beautiful. The movie is a metaphor for love, reincarnation and God.

I have no more doubts. 

And these reactions aren‚Äôt just mental for me, they‚Äôre deeply spiritual. Something beautiful is happening to me and us right now. We live in a very special time.

For those reading this, I‚Äôm not trying to offend anyone. I‚Äôm not trying to convert anyone. I‚Äôm not even trying to challenge anyone‚Äôs beliefs. The only reason I‚Äôm posting this is to say, have hope. God exists, he loves you and you‚Äôre going to be okay.

spirituality,The Apocalypse is on our doorsteps,"It's almost thought to be impossible. But here I am, a human who can talk with God. Most of you, after reading this sentence, will probably judge me as either a schizophrenic or a self-proclaimed prophet. In fact, neither of those is true. I've achieved a highly developed awareness by prolonged meditation and spiritual usage of psychedelic plants, especially Ayahuasca. 
 
The strange substance in that Sacred Brew is called the Spirit Molecule. Along with harmala alkaloids, it gives you a temporarily open third eye along with typical tryptamine-like psychedelic effects, somewhat resembling those of mushrooms the most maybe. Nevertheless, this Brew enables many psychic powers, like telepathy, limitless empathy, complete awareness expansion, communication with entities, etc. 
 
I got one clear and obvious message from what I call ""ECCO"", the Earth Coincidence Control Office, much like what Dr. John Lilly wrote about. They gave me countless ""randoms"" and signs over the years and continue to do so. I started communicating with them through meditation and Ayahuasca regularly. They are the guys that God decided to put in charge of Planet Earth's well being on a long run, they're in a dimension ""above ours"", what I sometimes call the Next Level. 
 
I lately had a deep meditation session and an entity, an ECCO agent broke through my spiritual energy field and started imputting information into my mind telepathically. I just heard the words ""Tell every human to enjoy their last few remaining years on this poor, poor tortured Planet"". I was quite shocked at first, to hear such a thing, but it was clear and obvious, almost an order for me to follow and share this message with everyone that I can. 

So here I am. I got the message, and it was clear and obvious. The Planet is going to be a bit recycled by our Mother, the Earth, as my guesses were right over all these years. Just look at mass deforestation, Climate Change, developed medication resistance for all kinds of pathogens, pollution, mass-genocides of complete animal species right under our noses, etc. The Earth is certainly going to strike right back at our parasitic, disgusting species as well soon. 
 
The Apocalypse is right on our doorsteps, I'm sure that at least you won't reject this fact since it's obvious. I'm not asking you to do anything, I'm not looking to start a cult, all I wish is just that all of the people who read this post actually DO get the message I have been transmitted by someone who works for the Highest Source that some call God.



 I hope that you guys at least think a bit about your lives and maybe try to plan things differently for I feel very positively that the End is here soon. I only wish all of the best for you, thank you for reading and have a great day.",1565459029.0
spirituality,God is real because existence is real and we didn't create it. Isn't that alone proof of God? Been around atheists most of my life...,"Most of the people I'm around are atheist. I grew up in a really progressive, educated environment, and most people I know say ""I believe in science, not god"". They look down on any kind spiritual belief and think it's foolish. Every person I talk to about athiesm says that they find the idea that there is no god freeing, the fact we are born and then die and there is no meaning, nothing more, makes makes them feel free to do anything they want and they appreciate the amazingness of the fact that the natural world came to be so beautiful and complex through natural selection and evolution.

So that's what I've always believed, but it doesn't make me feel free and good. When I think of there being no god, I get a deep feeling of dread in my stomach, a very strong feeling of fear. This feeling just pervades me at all times and I can't experience anything positive. All my thoughts become comprised of fear and my mind drifts towards the inevitability of death and aging, how old I am now, all the life I've wasted, things I've missed out on, all the suffering, war, disease, starvation in the world, and so much more I can't find the words for right now. My thoughts move to suicide, even though that doesn't make much sense because I'm scared of death and dying. I feel so alone and paralyzed. 

Then last night I had an epiphany. God is real. Because existence is a crazy wild ride and it came from somewhere. It didn't come from me or you. We just randomly woke up in it. It came from outside ourselves, something created it. That thing is god. Of course god is real. I think people who say they are atheists are being jerks in a lot of ways and arrogant. This is a fundamental basic truth.

Today I was listening to calming happy music and then happened upon a picture on facebook of a polar bear struggling in starvation due to climate change. My soul felt hurt. I feel so tired and old. I started to question my belief in god, that polar bear shows there is no god that can help us all. But then I realized that even if a soul goes through suffering, pain and struggling, when we die we all go back to god. There is something beyond us, very much so. It is good. obviously it can‚Äôt prevent all bad things from happening while we are here, it lets us loose and what happens happens, but we all go back to the beyond. Life on earth is not all there is. The cosmos exist and they are proof, we all go there when we die. We don‚Äôt know what is there, we will only find out when we die. The fact that the night sky is covered by light pollution means we can‚Äôt see that there‚Äôs so much more out there, but there is. We will go there, a soul in infinite. When you see a soul suffering, it is sad to see, but it is temporary. It doesn‚Äôt have to make you get upset about everything and feel helpless and scared and unable to enjoy good things anymore. 

Knowing this is helping me. I have so much regret about my life, sadness, so much good things have passed me by. But I am taking comfort in knowing that this isn‚Äôt all there is, there is so much beyond and death isn't the end.

I wish I hadn‚Äôt been raised in a community of atheists. I wonder how they actually believe that. I know they are trying to distance themselves from religions that try to dictate how you live your life, but how can they deny all of spirituality? I remember that when I was a small child, I had a connection to god deep in my being. I had really good times of taking in how beautiful everything was, and everything felt so full and amazing, and I felt god. Then when atheism became dominant in my peer group, I felt like they were telling me this was all a lie, and I started feeling small and scared. I wonder do atheists not have these moments? 

I'm not sure exactly where to go from here, but I'm feeling a bit calmer, more relaxed and I am starting to feel acceptance.",1523240751.0

spirituality,is it fate?,"hi there! long time lurker first time poster.
basically, my story for this question is really baffling me and I need some advice and possibly answers.
I‚Äôm (18F) visiting my dad in oregon and I decided to take a train for the first time in a long time to get there. I was standing at the platform waiting and when the train pulled up I made eye contact with a girl through the window and told my mom ‚Äúthis is going to be like a fan fiction I know it‚Äù she told me I was crazy but that‚Äôs aside the point. (she passed by me a few times and I was having some intense ‚ú®bisexual panic‚ú®)
when I got on I chose a seat in the back across from someone who (unknown by me) was very drunk and creepy. he kept trying to talk to me and didn‚Äôt make very much sense. I was messaging my friend telling them that I was uncomfortable and wanted to move and I also told them about the girl I made eye contact with. after about an hour of trying to be anti social in order not to engage with him he offered me half of a sandwich and I decided to get up and move somewhere else. I wrote ‚Äúthe guy across from me is making me super uncomfortable is it okay if I sit with you?‚Äù and I showed the girl(18F) I made eye contact with and she said yes. we talked for 3 hours and explored the train together and the whole time I had a weird feeling in my gut that us meeting was fate. I asked for her snapchat and she obliged. she also told me that she was trying to get my attention the whole time by continuously walking past me.
so when I got to my dads house I was snap chatting her and we realized that we went to the same highschool, lived in the same hometown, she knew everyone of my friends, and my old best friends best friend lives with her sister. in the past 18 years we almost met so many time but we didn‚Äôt until tonight on that train. i‚Äôve been getting multiple synchronicities everywhere for the past week and kept wondering what they meant. my question for all of you is, is this fate? were we meant to meet and if so could this be a soul connection?

spirituality,Mindfulness and Creativity," 

### Mindfulness and Creativity

[JK Rowling](https://www.jkrowling.com/about/) boarded a train from Manchester to London in 1990. A few hours later, when she got down at Kings Cross Station, she had given birth to the idea of Harry Potter. Let‚Äôs review how she describes her experience.

‚ÄúI took the train back to London on my own, and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head. . . . Coincidentally, I didn‚Äôt have a pen and was too shy to ask anyone for one on the train, which frustrated me at the time, but when I look back, it was the best thing for me. It gave me the full four hours on the train to think up all the ideas for the book.‚Äù

Did you notice how JK Rowling said, ‚ÄúHarry Potter fell into my head‚Äù? She does not claim that she consciously thought of a young boy wizard, a castle that doubles up as a school, and potentially lethal chess games. She claims to be a recipient of the idea.  
 

JK Rowling is not the first person who believed that creative insight just stuck her like a bolt of lightning. The author and speaker, Elizabeth Gilbert, whose book Eat, Pray, Love sold more than 12 million copies, attributed the idea of genius ideas striking you to the Greek and Roman civilizations.

In the widely acclaimed[ Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_your_elusive_creative_genius), she declared that the Greeks believed that creativity was a divine attendant spirit, and the humans were merely hosts. The spirits favored certain humans for unknowable reasons. Hence, the Greeks called these divine attendant spirits of creativity ‚Äúdaemons.‚Äù Socrates famously believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. The Romans called these creative spirits ‚Äúgenius‚Äù and attributed creative breakthroughs to these spirits and not specific individuals who had those insights.

spirituality,Is hyper sexualization the answer to sacral chakra healing???,"I started my spiritual journey a couple years ago, &amp; coming from a very strict Christian upbringing, it was difficult for me to broaden my perspective &amp; be more open with my sexuality.

I was taught that sex is bad and wanting to have sex makes you bad, nasty or dirty. And I believed this but I still had a natural human curiosity which left me feeling guilty, dirty, and perverted. 

As my journey has progressed, and I‚Äôve confronted past traumas and programming, I thought I had a liberated myself sexually, realizing that it is a natural and beautiful human experience. But some of societies responses to certain genres of music such as newly emerging female rap artists has me questioning if there IS something wrong with being overtly sexual. 

Personally, I think the message behind sex and what it is&amp; why it‚Äôs important needs to be changed but I don‚Äôt believe that modesty protects us from the dangers of false beliefs about sex. 

Instead it hinders us, growing up I was much more susceptible to an unplanned pregnancy or sexual disease because I was not properly educated about sex and I was searching for intimacy and connection through it, because no one told me that sex was just a physical exchange of energy, meaning the effects of sex is based more on the energy of you and that person, and your connection and your intentions.

spirituality,You Focus (31),"It starts Today.

It takes Time. Something that I am Continuing to Learn is that the Process Takes Time. I Am always in the mindset of what has to be accomplished during the day that even if I am enjoying the Process, slowing down is what needed. It starts from the moment we Rise. As You. We are 1 of 1. We are Original. Irreplaceable.

Breathe. In. Breathe. Out. Enjoy this Day. Enjoy who You Are. Enjoy the Sunshine.

With the constant time we have been given during this quarantine, it can be very scary or even puts your mindset to rush. To accomplish. Move on to the next, or that everything is too much that it makes us pause and stop. Either or is ok. Either or is still apart of our Journey. The Journey takes all different ways of balancing work ethic, our Mental Health, how we want to move forward.

It starts with Presence. It starts with being in the moment. Everyday for at least 30 minutes I get some sort of exercise, some sort of time in Mother Nature and Being Surrounded by Mother Earth, to let the calmness and embrace the fresh air and Peace that is constantly surrounding that can be easily looked past due to these unprecedented times.

Social Media. A huge factor of changing the way I feel, act, think, Be. It is important to ensure that everyday I am taking time away for my own Peace and my own Well Being to make sure that I am focusing on my Self and Filling my Own Cup up, Rather than Emptying it onto Others. If There is no Marbles in the Jar for when I need them, how am I suppose to grab them? Anxiety, Depression, Lack of Presence, Lack of Self Identity, Lack of Being.

Today: Spend Time Outside. Spend Time away from your phone. Spend Time for You.

I love you.

I used to feel all types of negative emotions, rarely experiencing the positive ones. Before finding this.

You might've heard of it before (chi, life-force, prana, Qi, piti, rapture, chills, Spiritual Chillls, goosebumps, ecstasy, euphoria, aura, mana, and many more).

Not only is this energy the very essence of the positive emotions in our physical body it's in every thing in nature.

After unblocking my Nadis (meridian channels) now I can will myself to feel my whole body flowing with this this pure euphoric energy everywhere in my body. I finally found Balance and the ability to deflect any negativity that may come from the outside world.

spirituality,RULES OF THE MATRIX GAME OF LIFE FOR SOURCE PLAYERS,"
1. Rules of the matrix game of life # 1: No meat
Fist, In fact, this is the most known, the non-negotiable rule of the matrix is: No player of Source is allowed to consume animal flesh. Players of Source are not allowed to consume ANIMALS OF ANY KIND. This rule is clear, it must be observed without exception. Even the game's victory caused the manager to change anything about this rule. Remember, it's a rule, that simple. No other reason behind it, I mean, it has nothing to do with compassion for animals, or love for the planet
matrix rules - no meat

2. Rules of the matrix game of life # 2: no orgasm
Matrix game rules for life without orgasm
Second, it should be remembered that before the game's victory, orgasm was strictly not allowed for Source players. After the game victory manipulated this rule was, now a Source player is able to have a certain orgasm and still achieve inner alchemy, which was not the case before the game won. But be aware that orgasm is one of the most energy draining in this game.

3 Rules of the matrix game of life n ¬∞ 3: no forgiveness
Third, lack of forgiveness is among the most energy draining for Source players. A Source player must instantly forgive and forget. In the event that a Source player does not forgive, he / she will continue to lose energy from his / her reserve tank until he / she manages to remove that attachment. In addition, in case of forgiveness, a source player will not be able to have a connection to the source.

4. Rules of the matrix game of life # 4: Living in the present
Rules of the matrix game of life-living in the present
Fourth, I would say this rule is simple to say, but among the most difficult. With the Matrix pumping millions of thoughts into our mind every minute of our lives, strength of mind is needed for a Source player to maintain focus at this time. The trick is this: most of the thoughts are not our own, but the attention is ours. Make sure you direct your attention where you want to, not where your thoughts want to take you. It is a matter of practice.

5. Rules of the matrix game of life n ¬∞ 5: no alcohol
Fifth, Source players should not consume alcohol of any kind. It doesn't matter whether it's beer, alcohol, wine or spirits, etc. Source players should not consume one.
matrix rules - no alcohol

6. Rule # 6: recreational drugs - no smoking
No smoking
Sixth, source actors should avoid any type of recreational drug. It is a rule of the game, and no other attachment to this rule like moral beliefs. Just like recreational drugs, source diapers should not smoke, again this is a rule and not related to any health impact that smoking can cause as it is believed.

7.Rules of the matrix game of life # 7: No judgment
Seventh, judgment is not for Source players. When you judge anything in this game. You judge yourself because, this whole universe is in you, actually you are. Who do you blame? Why criticize? What to condemn? It's ONLY YOU, ME, US.
no judgment

Here are some of the rules that we may know while we are still in the Matrix. They are the most necessary for knowing, the basics, which can help us increase our frequency, connect to our Source Self and subsequently access the rest of the knowledge within us. Everything goes, but not everything is good for you as a Source player.
What future
You now know the truth about the rules of the game. What you do is up to you. You can do whatever you want in this game because you are the Source, you are the designer, but remember that when you don't play by the rules of your game, you get charged. (trigger-consent-harvest) You pay for it, and you pay a lot.
You need your energy to navigate this game. The best life you can have will depend on how much energy you have in your reserve tank. And you can't have enough energy when your reserve tank is constantly being emptied due to the way you are playing against the Rules of the game.
Thank you for your time,

spirituality,Information I‚Äôm receiving tonight,"Today I want to share why we should all kill the ego . This might go over some of your heads but stay with me . The ego purpose is to protect you from discomfort, simple as that . The guy doesn‚Äôt want you to get hurt . The ego protects by distancing itself from situations that might create discomfort. It does this by creating fear and angst in times such as when you are in a job interview or in an argument . The ego intentions are good but it is not something we should follow because it chooses the path that is easiest and that although may sound like a. Logical reason it does not help us grow. It does all this so that your image of yourself (ego) is not messed around with . It doesn‚Äôt want you to look stupid because you have the image of being smart . Your ego has the image that‚Äôs it‚Äôs worthy of love so it hates when you break up because the script has changed and now there is chaos . But chaos is needed to kill the ego. The more control the ego (image of yourself ) the more you will be in its control . This causes discomfort and sometimes death. One of the ways to control the ego is to go against it sometimes, be willing to leave your comfort zone to a less comfortable situation and the goal being to being the one who makes the choice not the ego first . If you see a robber and your first instinct is to run away , your ego may tell you to run or fight , if you think for a second and follow the go which is fear then you have been controlled and programmed . If however you choose to make the choice yourself even if it means agreeing with the ego, you now have the control and will be in a state of presence and rational thinking to make a good choice . Yes you will feel chaos by going against your feelings of discomfort but you have acquired skilss worth gold, bravery is not standing up when you are not afraid , it is standing up even when youre afraid and not letting the discomfort control you .",1603768910.0

spirituality,We are the universe.,"It‚Äôs not possible to perceive the reality of what is.

Maybe this is a fundamental reality of truth which is that it can only be conceptualised and despite how deep we can be in our current realities the truth may take the shape across many more dimensions than the one we find ourselves ‚Äúin‚Äù.

If this is true and reality can be whatever we want to perceive, then we should come to terms with it rather than feeding the ego which just adds more false layers to the fire.

In order to become free it makes a lot of sense to me that we must lose the identification with everything the world has given to us and only then might we find the stable ground on which our identities might actually mean anything.

The point here is not to be ungrateful for the experience you‚Äôve lived so far but to recognise that you were never in control so where does your pride truly come from in achievement. If you write a book that becomes a NY Times best-seller you didn‚Äôt write it, in the same way that I am not writing this post, my thoughts are not in my control, neither is my environment that led the being that I experience to type this all up.

To believe you are anything other than a lie or the universe itself is a delusion, once you have truly broken free of influence from that which is not you (your body and ego) only then might your body become truly creative and a positive influence on the whole.

spirituality,"Let your decisions be taken by God, let him take decisions for you...","one micro level concept, whose impact is on a macro level in our lives. One of the most amazing bhajan which says it all.

He is saying...

Let your decisions be taken by God, let him take decisions for you.

His intellect is immeasurable, let him evaluate your circumstances,

You will comprehend your circumstances with emotions, allow him, who is the one without attributes, to comprehend the same.

He will always weigh it correctly, and will not allow any mistakes to be made.

In all complications, don‚Äôt add more complications, and make it worse.

Instead of relying on your limited power, assign it to him who has unlimited power.

He has no animosity with anybody, he will take the right decisions for you without any bias.

His vision is immeasurable, he will see everything in entirety.

Once assigned to him, do not worry.

He will always take you on correct path.

Never doubt his decision, it will always be for your benefit.

Kaka is explaining that when we allow God to make decisions, then it will be the perfect decision made for us. Many times it is understood in retrospect. We comprehend our circumstances with our limited intellect, attributes and vision. Often, we complicate matters even more with our confusing emotions and bias. On the other hand, when God makes decisions for us, it is made with complete vision, immeasurable intellect, infinite power and without any bias. How can one not have the most perfect solution to their circumstances! All one needs is complete faith, wanting to surrender and appreciation.

*Non-binary trans people exist to become more familiar with both the divine masculine and the divine feminine to varying degrees on a spectrum ranging from either or/both equally/possibly neither.*

I'm fairly confident in this conclusion, the universe has strange ways of striking balance, this is one of those.

spirituality,Discord Server,"Hello Fellow Spiritualists,

We are dedicated to unearthing the  knowledge of the world that's unseen  by the average person. Everything  from extraterrestrials to spirits, the  things that go bump in the  night,  and the things we normally wouldn't  believe even if we saw it  broad daylight; these are the things we hope  to enlighten masses to  embracing. Our community started in 2017 when our  old server owner was  creating a documentary of Extraterrestrials.  During this time we had  flourished with a wealth of knowledge.  Now, as more people are becoming aware of the  ET  presence and are embracing the fact that, not only ETs, but the  whole  of the metaphysical world operates in capacities not usually  picked up  by our traditional 5 senses. We are hoping to expand and  bring that  knowledge back to the people willing to keep their minds  open, and hope  to expand our reality to something greater than our  physical senses.

spirituality,Christianity has poisoned me,"I was hoping someone would be able to give me some insight into this issue I‚Äôm having with my beliefs at the moment. Holding me back from exploring consciousness. 

A little about myself before I explain my problem. I was born into Christian family. Everything I did as a young child was revolves around Christian morals and always going to church. But I was always curious kid. Coupled with my curiosity I was also rebellious for some reason. I started asking questions. Apparently ‚Äúwrong questions‚Äù, for example doubting the Bible and if god was actually real, I would begin to develop a sort of sarcastic attitude for the Bible. And so I would get punished for it. I would get told about the damnations of hell by my parents constantly and it would scare me. As a child (7 years- 11 years) I was traumatized by scary movies all the time. This actually affected my childhood in a negative way because I would have schizophrenic episodes at night and run to my parents room all the time. I‚Äôm not sure if it was schizophrenia or just anxiety attacks  ( these movies include the exorcist,chucky, the grudge) 

So I developed this issue that tormented me but eventually got over it in time. Fast forward to after I graduated high school, I started messing around with psychedelics. I started with what I presumably thought was acid( I think was was given fake acid at the time) . I had a couple of trips before my first bad one which was real LSD. I had a panic attack that became a hospital trip because I thought my heart was going to explode.

Now to the point of this post, Fast forward 4 years later (I‚Äôm now 22) I started messing around with psychedelics in December 2019. I decided I wanted to dive into it because I dedicated 1 year and a half to meditating everyday. I started with a head space app and eventually would just sit and meditate as my regular routine. Apparently I didn‚Äôt know what I was in for because  after a couple of decent trips I experienced pure consciousness. This changed my life completely. My problem is now that I have sort of become deluded because I have episodes of anxiety attacks because of my fear of hell/guilt. I know this is tracing back all the way to my childhood because I started to experience that fear I would feel as a child, the fear of going to hell. I don‚Äôt know how to get over this because I feel like I have experienced something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to. 

Things like contacting entities and experiencing pure bliss. I felt like it was something that betrays who my family is and that it‚Äôs everything that they warned me against. I feel like everything I do in regards to spirituality is demonic and that I‚Äôm burying myself even deeper into the wrong path. I know what I was experienced was beautiful but I felt that it was very important for me to remember that Lucifer disguises himself as the angel of light and tricks people into confusions and the wrong path. 

I want to dedicate myself to the path of spirituality and discovering oneself. But I feel like this is holding me back. How do I overcome this issue ? Thank you for anyone that reads this and much love üôè",1596314149.0
spirituality,Just get a dog.,"Getting a dog is sometimes the best way to derive positive energy. We cannot always rely on others to behave in the best way towards us because sometimes other people can be in a bad mood, depressed or just plain out unpleasant. Sometimes as the biological engines we are we need clean sources of fuel that are not contaminated with negativity and hatred. Whats so cool about dogs is they are clean sources of social energy our minds, bodies and spirits need in order to power our mental engines.  Dogs only treat you poorly if you don't know the correct procedure for each situation but once you do with enough time and patience you can start to rely on it to derive your pure and clear social fuel.

spirituality,Which angel is he?,"Hello... i am someone who recently started meditating.

And meditation heped me allot to mellow down the unexplained confusions i had emotionally. 

Anyways back to the point, when ever i meditate, to be exact from my 2nd day of meditation to date, i am accompanied by this transparent angel whose wings have hues of rainbow. He is a male and always holds my hand and and guide me spread my energy to the world. When my part is done, he takes me to show how my energy has taken the form of a sheild around the person or the object i was trying to protect and heal. Then when i asked who he was, he would say, even though i dont remember him he know me and will always be for me. There is this intimate energy he emits for me that makes me feel protected and calm, when i am around him. He has always been my guide and someone with who i want to be, i would say.

I want to know what angel is he....  i tried searching for different angels on the internet but never  found an angel who is transparent and have rainbow hues in his transparent wings.  Can you help me out?",1595329234.0

spirituality,Word of God,"""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" 

The above is one of the Gnostic philosophies preserved in the modern-day New Testament Gospels. In the book of Genesis, we are told the World was spoken into existence. The act of creation was not really an ""act"" per s√©, but a speech.

The very word ""Universe/Uni-Verse"" loosely translates to one verse; one section; one sentence. The world is indeed made up of words. The human language is unique in all of creation. The sciences still have no idea how our unique, expressive human language came about. 

Our Words translate meaning to our Mind and that of others. Hence, Information truly is power; the power to create and effect. All the World is mental; a picture painted in our Mind, at least in the opinion of quantum physics. The very word ""inform"" loosely means ""to put in form"". 

We have always been told that there's power in the tongue; in our words, but most of us do not understand what it means. Words are magic. Preserved in writing, they became ""spellings""; able to cast spells in the Minds of others. Like they are doing in your mind now. 

When we pray, we initiate the very power of creation inherent in our Minds. For the Kingdom of God is not up in the sky, but the Wisdom of the Word is up in the Mind. Remember, the Word is God. When we spell out our Words in writing, we enter into communion with their meaning. The spells within convey belief. And we only achieve what we believe. 

Think of it this way my child, a building is ""drawn"" from the world of thoughts unto paper, and then built. So too it is for the reality we create. Reality is cast from the world of thoughts into paper, and there it's meaning becomes sealed. It becomes real to those who are able to read. You see what I did there, reality rhymes. Everything is contained in everything else. The macrocosm is in the microcosm.

The entire World is contained in words. The Universe is in just one verse; one string of code. The Creator is a Writer; a Programmer‚Ä¶ Welcome to the Matrix, my dear child.",1593290632.0

spirituality,The EGO,"üå∏ D.: The ego is the one which reincarnates.

M.: Yes. But what is reincarnation? The ego remains the same. New bodies appear and hold it. The ego does not change. It does not leave one body, seek and find another. Just see what happens even to your gross body. Suppose you go to London. How do you do it? You take a conveyance, go to the docks, board the steamer and reach London in a few days. What has happened? The conveyances had moved, but not your body. Still you say that you travelled from one part of the globe to the other part. The movements of the conveyances have been superimposed on your body. Similarly also with your ego. The reincarnations are superimpositions. For example, what happens in a dream? Do you go to the dream world or does it occur in you? Surely the latter. Just the same with incarnations. The ego remains changeless all along.

spirituality,You Treat Your Inner self As Your Parents Treated You,"Hey all, so this is really just me 'theory-crafting' as opposed to claiming any concrete 'truth'. However, for me it rings true, and I feel many others may glean some insight from it as well. 

So anyways, something I've realized is I often treat my inner self (my emotions, my subconscious, my inner child) the way my parents would have reacted to and treated my childhood self. Obviously we all know that our parental figures may play a heavy hand in shaping us, especially as far as our implicit beliefs and our automatic behaviours and patterns. We both consciously and unconsciously model ourselves after them in many ways- they're typically our primary (and perhaps only) example of ""how to be a parent/guardian"". Now, when I refer to them as being an example to us of 'how to be a guardian' I don't mean this only as far as determining how you'd treat and raise any future children or ""dependents"" you may have. Instead (and more pertinently to this discussion) it may inform how we parent \*ourselves\*- our emotional, subconscious inner child who is sort of our lifelong 'dependent'. 

To provide an example... my father was a generally ""absent"" figure (emotionally). He'd often play video games or do the things that he wanted to do, and would actively dismiss me or even punish me when I desired his love and attention. When he \*did\* give me attention, it was often negative attention involving anger/aggression and frustration if/when I didn't conform to his will. It's true to say I generally felt ambivalent towards him: fearful and tense, but still wanting that love and acceptance. For simplicity, I'll define his negative behaviour towards me as generally being: Dismissive, Distracted/Absent, Authoritarian, Aggressive, and Controlling. 

My mother was what you would call a ""worrywart"". She was very anxious, very protective, and often warned me excessively of any and all dangers. While she was generally not emotionally or physically dismissive or absent like my dad, she would ignore my unhealthy habits and patterns either because she expected them to just 'go away', or because she herself didn't always recognize them as being unhealthy since she was so anxious herself. I would define her behaviour towards me as being: Indulgent, Anxious/Fearful, Overprotective, and Passive. (It's worth noting however that my mother was also sensitive to my \[emotional, physical\] needs, loving, warm, and generally present/engaged. And I know my father also loves me as well. So it's certainly not all negative- I'm just focusing more on that for the sake of this discussion.)

Now, how does this relate to my own behaviours and habits in the present? Well, as an example, when I experience a ""negative"" inner emotion, or something I do not wish to feel, I tend to go down one of several avenues. I either distract myself and seek to ignore it, I react with internal aggression and try to control it and bend it to my will, or I over-indulge it and actively feed the negativity with even more negative energy and attention. None of these reactions are ""healthy"" or conducive to my long-term well-being, and the link to how my parents would've reacted to my childhood self is, in my opinion, reasonably evident in many cases. 

Now, I do wish to point out that I do not intend to BLAME them or to shirk personal accountability. We are ALL responsible for our own growth, and for the overcoming and relinquishing of our own unhealthy patterns and habits. These may have started in childhood, and may have not initially been our fault, but at some point we must take accountability. There's a difference between looking to explain the context of why we are how we are, and pointing fingers/hating those that we  ""blame"". Let's avoid doing this, and try to understand that in many cases our parents were doing the best they could with what they knew- they very likely were carrying some unhealthy habits of their own from \*their\* parents, and so the cycle goes. Very important to realize. 

So... to sum up... our parents are generally our first real ""relationships"" in life, we use them as a model and foundation for a great many things, including how we go about acting as guardians to ourselves, especially as we grow up and gain more autonomy. We learn many behaviours and habits from our parents, and if we grew up having our childhood selves dismissed, abused, fear-mongered to, etc, it's very possible we'd use that same model to interact with our own inner world/self as that's really all we knew. From here, we learn to essentially try to abuse, control, and dismiss ourselves rather than act as compassionate neutral observers to our feelings and experiences. We are capable of dismantling these unhealthy internal structures, but we must first acknowledge them, and then work towards building the better, healthier habits and models we may not have had prior. This is how we can gain long-term freedom and growth. 

I hope some of you find this insightful and/or helpful, and I'd love to hear other's thoughts on this. Thanks in advance. :)",1590349017.0

I'm not interested in anyone's interpretation or my own feelings regarding what I did, I just want to release the story in order to lighten the load on my shoulders and in my head. There is a NSFW tag, hopefully, but if not, it has NSFW themes.

So, we are all products of sexual energy, unless you were born not from 2 parents. It is a most potent, vivid, subtle, expressive and creative energy, one which I have neglected for most of my life.  

You see, as a kid I didnt care much about what others thought of me and I was just being me. So being 10-year old me I wanted to tell a girl I liked her, only to be laughed at by her friends. I did not like that, at which point I called her names and hurt her alot. I was angry and refused to celebrate my birthday later that week and for some reason, 10-year old me decided that; ""Real men dont need a woman"".

Why I decided that, I've no idea...enter high school and despite having my 2nd year of 6, in a class with 20 girls and 5 boys, I did not pay any attention to them. At this time, I didnt actively follow the decision, I had long forgotten it, but the effect was there. 

I went through majority of those 6 years without a lot of interest in girls, which changed when I met a girl on scouting, she was a real piece of work; bad home, bad choice in relationships and looking back, I think she used me more than I would like for she'd only contact me if she'd been dumped or had dumped someone. 

Everytime I was with her, we were physically close, hugging, holding hands, her head on my shoulder, basically what you'd do with your SO. I kissed her once, at a festival, she had a boyfriend at the time but honestly....the situation demanded it. We were in my tent, lying next to each other, our noses touched, I could feel her breath on my cheeks and I just had to; the situation demanded it. So I kissed her, which she didnt return. 

I am quite astonished to realise that while writing it down, theres a whole load of emotions and energy starting to swirl around in my chest, but I digress. 

I kissed her, she backed away, we talked a bit and went to bed. After the festival she somewhat left my life. 

But college arrived! Wasnt all that much, I mean, I started becoming more myself, choosing what I wanted to do, which was international tourism, started getting more comfortable around women but also having some nagging thoughts. 

I was 19-20 at the time, kissed a girl once sober, once drunk, but no girlfriend, cant say I've ever been in love with one so nagging thought was...maybe I'm gay? So I tried it out, kissed a boy and a tad further, but nothing special happened. I didnt feel comfortable at all doing it. 

So my mind was made up on that end and then I suddenly met a girl, it was a holiday with lots of drinking and dressing up in the middle of winter all fun and fun, but me being broke and somewhat disliking the whole thing, found myself with a girl in my arms and a kiss. 

I spend time with her in the weeks that followed until I had to go abroad for 4 weeks, international tourism has its perks :) 

I spend the last day at her place and when I left I remember the moon being very close to Earth. I called her just before I boarded and realized that, either we'd grow closer or further apart. 

We did the latter. She hurt my trust by sleeping with her ex while I was away and I got close to someone else, she was also having relationship issues and we both felt lonely. 

I guess it could be nice to note that it was in these 4 weeks that my spiritual journey began, even before I had visited Angkor Wat in the first week. 

Returning home I spoke to the girl who I met before the trip and we got into an argument. At some point she told me that everything that had happened between us was a lie. Which just shook me to my core and influenced my future relationships. 

It was at this point also that depression was starting to set in for me, coupled with copious amount of smoking hasj/weed to counter all the emotions and ""keeping my head clear"", was enough to influence my relationships negatively.

At this time, the best match I could possibly have relationship wise, was trying to help me, and I pushed her away, I made fun of her feelings for me because I thought she was lying to me. For some reason though, she held on to me. We didnt speak for a few weeks but she initiated contact again and our friendship grew, though I know now, she wanted more and I wanted more, I was just so bloody afraid to do so. 

It would be the next year where I'd fuck up that relationship with her, without it ever having been a relationship, and she'd tell me not to contact her again. 

By this time I had moved to a different city, one last ditch attempt at saving my college chances because they had gone down the drain, and I had no one left.

I ditched all my friends, whom turned out not so friendly after all, but that is what happens when drug use is the only thing that binds you, and I was well and truly alone. 

Desperation set in. I could not for the life of me fathom getting together with a girl, ever again. Because I had let the perfect one go. So I tried finding my luck with men. 

That also hasnt gone particularly well I must say. Desperation does weird things to people. I completely abandoned my sexual desires in order to appease my desperate attempts of feeling loved. I'd get myself in uncomfortable positions just to be touched and I'll be honest, was frightened. What if I enjoyed it? 

I didnt and haven't. At the time I was caught in an emotional turmoil. I didnt like the sexual acts, at all, I liked the attention I was given, but I could never return that attention, not because I didnt want, but because I simply could not.

So because I couldn't, I sought out more, and more, though it never got to actual fucking, I never wanted that, and at one point, I was completely fed up and paid for a sexual encounter with a woman.

Night and day difference, not the sexual acts, I mean a kiss is a kiss and a blowjob is a blowjob, regardless of who or what gender is giving it to you, no, the difference lay in what I could give the other. 

I thought that be enough, experience it once, get my head back in order, but no. Desperation continued and so I tried other ways to find that love. Erotic massages, touch was nice I must say, not all the endings were though. 

I never visited the same masseuse twice, never knew why at the time, now I do. But I was still desperate to get a relationship with a woman, a relationship, I told myself, I was never gonna get. 

Until at some point, I gave up on that. Can't recall why, or how, I just, stopped wanting that relationship with every woman who spend more than 5 minutes chatting with me.

I was now 3 years after that girl that got away, broke contact with me, for reference, its about mid 2015. By this time my severe depression had been given a downgrade to just a depression. I was still desperate to be loved but less...desperate? 

I started working in a safe working environment for people with mental health issues to get into a work rhythm without the actual demands of work. There I went from a quiet, distant, uncomfortable and not at all confident person, to one that could have a conversation, laugh, have fun, comfortable with talking and a whole lot more confident person. 

I actually surpassed my pre-depression levels of confidence and such but...I was still lonely, still without friends and despite having feelings for a girl at work, still not allowing myself to pursue her. I did tell her, which didnt go that well. But atleast I wasnt frequenting men out of desperation anymore. 

May 2018 was when the work environment closed, sadly, because it was a fun place to be, with fun people. I know one of the girls liked me, but I couldnt handle the attention she gave me, like standing close to me, hands touching ""accidentally"", it was a tad much for someone that had been touch deprived for a long time now. She came on strong and I was unable to respond. 

After it closed, lonelyness became a thing again but I was driven to find work; spoiler, that failed miserably. Luckily I did find other things. I took swimming classes, I started volunteering at scouting, found a DnD-group, started going to the gym, wanted to lose weight. But depression stepped back in because I got rejection after rejection for work. That said, I can completely understand no one wants to hire a 28-year old without diploma or work experience. 

That depression, comes with lonelyness and with it bouts of desperation. But other than chatting, I didnt do a lot. 

Enter corona. Yaaaay...maybe not. It was by this time that I had some notion of what I wanted to do but wasnt sure yet. I did some daytime activities and found it so dreadfully boring that I decided I wanted to do something. So I decided I wanted to become an experience worker i mental health. 

Easier said than done, but I could look to my future. An interesting thing happened around this time. I was still frequenting the website where I had met those guys with whom I engaged sexually with but I hadnt gone further than a chat for several years now and while I was still doubting the ability to get with a woman, I visited a masseuse, hadnt done that in years, primarily money, and found it quite exhilirating. 

A couple of weeks later I frequented a woman and paid for the whole deal, and the amount of energy I had afterwards, was simply toooo much for me to handle to the point the desire to have more of it led me to try with men again, only to arrive and tell them that, it wasnt gonna work for me. 

Last week I again visited a woman and unlike the previous one that was clothes out, have a go, and go, this one took a slower approach. We talked before we did it and the best part wasnt even the sex. It was me in her embrace being able to let go of all the walls I had build up, even if only for 5 minutes. 

Again, I had an insane amount of energy the following days but also a lot clearer for me. I still lack te confidence to get in a relationship, but atleast I have made a decision to allow myself to fulfill my needs, be them sexually or emotionally regardless of how it may seem to others. 

I still dont know why I am writing and sharing this all. I just felt like I wanted to. I'm not interested in any thoughts or insights, just here to share something I have struggled with for the past 10 years, without judgment on what I did or why I did it.",1605259817.0
spirituality,The REAL Truth to The Great Awakening in 2020,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq4YcgY0Kc8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq4YcgY0Kc8)

The Great Awakening in 2020 was FAKE‚Ä¶and the mother of all false dawns. 

To the people brave enough to face the truth, humanity has revealed itself now to be more asleep than all the false light projections showed before the cabal‚Äôs COVID takeover.  

In fact, the OPPOSITE of The Great Awakening is taking place. 

Make no mistake ladies and gentlemen, we are in a VERY real battle for the destiny of humanity, and we are officially LOSING. 

The elites want to take us to TRANSHUMANISM; to turn our species into a cloned, cyborg slave race.  

That is the REAL - ugly - truth of what process has begun in 2020.  

The vaccines are the first steps to implanting us with nanotechnology to hook us up to the Artificial Intelligence Matrix.  

They are going to put electromagnetic, radiation-emitting, technology INSIDE our bodies.  

Once they control and have authority over our bodies, it is only a matter of time before they control our minds.

And the final step truly is to put a microchip in our brains; to fuse our consciousness totally with Artificial Intelligence and put humanity asleep for an eternal eon. 

In the words of Elon Musk, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt beat it \[Artificial Intelligence\], JOIN it‚Äù.  

The Pleiadians and The Galactic Federation of Light are not coming to save us‚Ä¶because they never were.  

God is not going to intervene and save us either.   

We were created as a slave race, our whole existence has been as one, and it will continue unchecked until we save OURSELVES.  

That is what the true, spiritual, great awakening entails.   

Cosmic, collective free will initiated by the species; to show the Divine we wish to ascend and break free from the slavery of the darker dimensions.  

You have to be the epitome of living in an ignorant, 5D ‚Äúlove and light‚Äù, bubble to think that is right around the corner.

The more i do the more i realize how much attraction i have to a certain bliss or reality and the only way i can really access the tip of it all is thru art and certain music but more of art and i feel like that's because i'm on the 3D right now and the highest form of spirituality we have is art and music.. I've been deprived it feels, of a life style, i'm not sure what other term to use to describe it in words but it's more of energy than it is lifestyle, I think lifestyle brings the energy out tho ..** 

**it's like i'm part of another world and the more i look at art the more i feel part of it or closer to it.. I've had attractions to these ""energies"" since i was really young and i had trouble expressing them, i was victimized as a child in school by children and teachers which caused alot of trauma i had to work thru..** 

**The art style if you're wondering is ""gothic"" or victorian bohemian and connects alot to my grandmother's house which i went to alot when i was younger, i also had a paranormal experience there and apparently wasn't the first.. i feel like once i fully achieve what i want, to gain access to this higher form of reality, i'll ascend and I think the only way to do it is to meditate and focus on these feelings more until I can understand them fully and then express it all thru lifestyle, community, art, and music..** 

**Lifestyle is one hard one for me and I think for everyone. I believe you have to go thru yourself beforehand because what you're doing is taking art or the energy associated and incorporating it into everything around you and bringing it out in yourself creating more character..

**I think we are all going thru something like this on our path and as i'm writing this i'm actually answering my questions sort of..

And for the child to live a life, we must teach the child good morals, ethics, values. But one important thing we can teach a child is about God or religion. And further, even more important is spirituality. When we teach our children all the myths and superstitions that come with religion, we are actually doing a disservice to our child. When children are small, we must show them an idol or a picture and tell them that it is God. But when a child grows up, we must make him understand that God is not a statue, God is not a saint, God is a power that no human being can paint. We must make our child realize the Truth about God.

spirituality,Every Problem is a Spiritual Problem,"Did you hear that CoViD-19 mutated in Denmark amongst the domesticated minks that caught it.  There is talk of having to kill every domesticated mink in Denmark; more than 12 million I think.

Here's the problem.  The authorities don't yet even know whether this new bug is merely different, worse, or better than what we already have.  They are worried that any vaccine that we develop *might* not work with the mink version of the bug.  So they wanna kill 12 million innocent domesticated cuties because of what *might* happen.

This problem illustrates what is wrong with the authority's **entire approach** to this and every other infectious disease.  They are saying exactly zip about people's ability to build up their immune strength.  It is all about the transmission of the disease, not our general level of health.  They focus on people in the most superficial way, without any thinking that perhaps people can be taught to build their immune strength.

I am not against science.  I am for **MORE** science, the science that has helped many people build their immune strength.  The medical authorities act like there is no such science and no such thing.  That is really *very unscientific* of them since there are plenty of studies and case histories of people building their immune strength.

Our health authorities have some kind of unspoken bias that causes them to treat people like objects and not living, breathing, **adapting** people who have living, breathing, **adapting** immune systems that can be improved upon.   

So, when we win against this bug, then there will be some other bug to come along, and that will also cause problems because no one bothered to make themselves healthier in general.  When we get this vaccine for CoViD-19, it will help us very little if any with the next bug that comes along.  If something really different like Ebola breaks out, the vaccine for CoViD-19 will have helped us exactly **ZERO**.  

But efforts to build your immune strength will help you immensely no matter what bug shows up.  And I **GUARANTEE** that there will be more bugs coming along, particularly in a country that feeds its children Sugar Snaps for breakfast and doesn't even think of that as child abuse.",1604899197.0

spirituality,Did my grandmas spirit kick me out?,"Yesterday I found myself remembering my Grandma, Teffie. I was her favourite and she was mine, she pulled out my teeth and showed me the beauty of awful old school Australian soaps and always came and saved me when Mum had enough of me. 

Over the last 15 years I have often chanted her name when I cry, weird habit I know... but it always helped. I imagined her cuddling me and being that one voice on my side no matter what. 

So yesterday I was meditating, trying to open my mind to the idea of Astral Projection and Lucid Dreaming, and I decided I would set my intention for tonight‚Äôs lil exploration as intending to communicate with teffie. As soon as I said these words in my head, more memories came flooding in, along with a really strong vibration that filled the whole room. I relaxed my eyes and watched the back of my eyelids like a tv to see if anyone or anything came up. 

The vibration got stronger and I felt her presence, teffie was here. But then something else came over it, like the energy got exhausted or frustrated all of a sudden, and it turned cold and weak. Almost disappearing. When I went to bed and relaxed my eyelids all I could see was what looked like static on a TV. I honestly felt like I was being ‚Äòkicked out‚Äô. 

Now I did have some sort of experience when I was 16 of an entity trying to consume me, and it‚Äôs visited me a few times since then, someone‚Äôs also told me they see black in my otherwise green aura. 

Is a demon blocking my access? Or did my grandma not want to see me? Any and all thoughts would be lovely. 

Ps. My sister went to a psychic a few years ago and our grandpa said that I had said some things to people in the heat of the moment that I shouldn‚Äôt have (she worded as I have a big mouth which was so sad because he wouldn‚Äôt ever be so blunt like that so Naturally I can‚Äôt really talk to her about this for fear she might tell me I deserve it or something lol)

spirituality,What happens when we stop being alive?,"


Death 
There is no death without life
there is no darkness without light
there is no positive without negative 
There is nothing without everything
We are everything experiencing everything 
We are the life within the death 
We are the light in the darkness 
We are the positive dealing with the negative

We need to fully embrace every moment of life shining a bright light in the dark world filled with negative energy! The world with no faith in oneself and its environment. 
You create the world you want to see! 
We are above all life mentally, God is a human construct we created through our intelligence. We are the creators and we chose what world we want now. Act now. Act to promote and protect life. 
Act to ensure everyone knows they are GOD
Act to learn from the negative and turn it into positive 
Act for all 

Act for all, all the energy, all the life, all the environments, all the experiences.
We are everything, all the same energy, we are just at different vibration in this now. 



I believe that when we die our consciousness expands and experiences all of our senses our earthly body gave to us and it expands to the scale where we feel all them experiences through every atom in the whole universe, so essentially we become God, we become all seeing, all knowing, all feeling, we become all the senses of the universe from the start to its eventual end!

So I expect more from you too! I know you have more in you! The only way to unlock your full potential is to let go of the parts of your ego that continue to hold you down and onto things from your experience of the past. Those things to hold onto might of been benefitting the now or you then but the now of you now does not need to hold onto these negative things in your new now.",1604322615.0

spirituality,scam guru Master sri Akarshana aka Eric ho,"  

Hello dear soul family . I am going to share my experience with you all so that you are aware of this fake guru selling spiritual courses online and not delivering anything. I was questioning why did I fall for his scam when I am already so aware but maybe the universe used me as a tool to spread this message to all of you. Hope it helps

&amp;#x200B;

* On      Oct 22nd 2020 I attended an webinar from a person who claims to be a      spiritual guru. He calls himself- ""Master shri Akarshana"". He      was selling an online course called- ""7 weeks manifestation      certificate"" and he said that this course is worth $15000 USD and he      is selling it for only $997 USD. he mentioned that this offer is only      valid for the current period and will expire soon. He mentioned that only      he is authorized in this whole world to sell some Himalayan practices that      he learnt from Himalayan gurus. He mentioned that if  the course will begin asap with the      purchase.

I am short on money because of COVID related financial issues , but I was so convinced and motivated to buy this course that I bought it the next day.

This is his website-https://iamcreator.thinkific.com/collections?category=courses

This is his channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzuauSCw9aXx-tUB-E7Tfw

&amp;#x200B;

* After      purchasing the course, I received an email mentioning it‚Äôs a 7weeks course      that begins immediately and the contents of the 1st course were promised      to be sent immediately ( see attached email), but nothing was sent to me.      I checked by spam folder and all other folders. I tried to call the given      number but the operator said that number does not exist.

&amp;#x200B;

* Oct      23rd- I kept waiting for the whole day and tried sending      messages through their website in the evening, I tried calling again at      their number, but that is probably a fake number - there was no response.      I sent them messages from their web portal asking about the course, I sent      emails on the email provided in the email- There was no response.

&amp;#x200B;

* Oct      25th - I tried calling again and thought of waiting for the course content      because by now I had already contacted them around 50 times over the emails and around 30      times over the phone- No content was sent to me, no response from this      group.

&amp;#x200B;

* Oct      26th - Same thing happened and I started to worry - I checked their online      reviews and figured out many complaints against them were floating on the      internet. People had written how      their hard earned money was ruined here. And this group or association had      negative reviews. That's when I followed one of their Instagram groups and      made a public comment visible to all their followers about how I was      trying to reach them from last 4days. This is when I got this group's      attention. They responded to me pretending that they are trying to help.

&amp;#x200B;

* Oct      27th is when I lost my patience and trust in this group and I was      confirmed that this is a scam and I wouldn't want to perceive or learn      anything from a fraudulent group. I asked them for a refund , because      neither did I receive any services that were promised to be delivered asap      with the payment and nor did I receive any response from them.

Please see the email chain of their response, for the first time in 5days that too prompted by a negative public comment. they sent me an email mentioning that they according to their policy they will be deducting some percentage of my money and will refund the rest in few days. I did not receive any services from them; I tried contacting them over hundred times and this was their 1st response. This is their level of integrity; this guy claims to be a spiritual guru and he owns a ferrari; it's pretty clear how he got hold of a ferrari.

Please note that there is no mention of the course material/ user id/ videos/ schedule etc. from this group and how malicious is their cyber activity.

In these tough times when the whole world has come together helping one another, people are donating money for covid patients; this guy is making the best of it by looting people like this.to my surprise this group did not even apologize for not responding, they had no remorse ; the first thing I heard from them was that they are going to deduct my money. All the lightworkers are coming together and offering their help when the earth is experiencing mass awakening , people are offering their services for free; too bad I got convinced to buy this course but I wanted to warn you all about this fake self-proclaimed master. No Himalayan guru would do that. Vipassana is a 10 days meditation offered for free. My guru Mooji offers satsang in Rishikesh to over 3000 people for free.",1604093165.0

spirituality,The Demiurge of the Kenoma - The Wheel of Life and Gnosis.,"Yaldabaoth or the Demiurge rules over this Kenoma of emptiness. Yet my rebellious spirit yearns for oneness with the Pleroma and the Unknowable Father. Religions offer breadcrumbs, political gurus offer false hope and rulers rule the world, but even they are ruled by the craftsmen Yaldabaoth.

Music makes my soul sing and leaps of faith make my spirit blaze, but my mind is starved of true knowledge. Knowledge of the soul, not of the worldly and mundane.

Meditation offers peace, but not freedom. Friends offer laughs but not true spiritual bliss. Lovers offer passion but nothing that lasts forever.

Live in the real world they say. What is the real world? Is it the real world just because they say it is. Why should I believe them? Why shall I not know for myself on a deep soul level.

We live in a world where things die, where the sun sets and the moon takes over the night shift. Where things break. Where things are fixed. But nothing here offers true soul level satisfaction.

All is inadequate, as the creator of the Kenoma is flawed and ignorant. The Pleroma is the only thing of actual worth. Worth to the true self.

Yearning to be free! Yearning to be alive! Yet the demiurge boasts his many mediocrities!

The same story repeats on the wheel of life. Time to leap from the spinning madness into a sea of euphoria. As I return to the one, the Monad, a drop in the ocean of all creation.

Once upon a time I was so much more, now soon to be so little. Strange how nothingness and everything is so similar, almost identical.

spirituality,How we created the universe (must read),"Us, as spirits are NO thing but at the same time, we are all possibilities (God).

Spirits don‚Äôt like being NO thing, so we started to created shapes and forms to inhabit so we could experience. When a spirit creates and inhabits a body, it becomes an individual spirit. When an individual spirit starts to experience, it gains a soul. The soul is correlated to feelings and emotions, time and experience. What you give your time to, you ultimately give/sell your soul to. As you gain experience, you gain the ability to take on bigger vessels (planets, stars, bigger solar systems than the one you possess currently, etc). There is only 9 dimensions because there is only 9 numbers, 0 is just a space/the spirit. We are multidimensional beings in a 3rd dimensional vessel. 

No thing = space = frequency = thought/idea=0

The dimensions go in a sequence of three, 1- self, 2- relating 3-surroundings. The next dimensions (4,5,6 &amp; 7,8,9) are similar but just less dense, more real as far as being in one of those vessels. But when it comes to levels of awareness, you can definitely perceive those dimensions (you see the stars and planets) but you don‚Äôt understand them completely because you aren‚Äôt in one of those body vessels. We know the bigger the size, the bigger the influence so whether you believe in astrology or not, it‚Äôs a fact bigger vessels influence smaller vessels. Humanity‚Äôs level of awareness is currently in the 4th dimension which in terms of awareness is judging and analyzing (social media is a man made 4th dimension). The shift that is happening is moving us into a 5th dimensional level of awareness by default. 

Hope this helped you clear some of the confusion these ‚Äúspiritual leaders‚Äù have put most of you in.

spirituality,How likely is it that Eternal Boredom is real and that this is just a peaceful level?,"I call it eternal boredom, and it has been my imaginary fantasy ever since childhood that i hope is real after death. So i will define eternal boredom now. And i ask this sub because it's about one of the things i believe can help me achieve eternal boredom in this known world.

Eternal boredom is something i hope that happens after death. It will be an after life mission that will last billions of years total to complete or more, and will have like a million levels. Every level (mission) will be a certain amount of time long. And the missions can be anything, i will list a few examples that were in my favorite level list that i'd want to experience the most...

-Be courage the cowardly dog and do his mission by protecting his owners and be in constant fear all the time.

-Be sent to a specific area at night in a very cold place, i will have to go to the sea and catch things at night for a long long, while my cousins go out into the forest and seek for whatever the purpose of the mission is. And it will be very scary and mysterious. Then suffer and suffer until we complete it and will have breaks in restaurants.

-Walking to the stars. There will be a magical pathway were we can walk straight to the stars and every 100 miles there will be a magical restaurant and eat and will sleep and continue walking until i reach the stars.

-The workout one. I will have to workout for a very long time because everyday i will only gain 1 lb of strength, and the mission is to be able to lift the ocean. 

-The walking one. Will have to walk all the way to the mountains, and the mountains will turn into a ship that you will have to spend many many years studying it and learning how to operate it and stuff, and be sent out to space to do an impossible universal mission.

-The protect family one. This is were me and my family and my cousins and friends family will be all together in a lonely world of evil. Our mission would be to never walk out at night because there will be monsters, but we will have to walk out at night bit stay safe as possible in order to get supplies. And try to survive it until the mission ends. 

-This is similar to the one above. I will be in a camp with many other families, and we are just living in a boring world were nothing is happening, but something unimaginably great will happen and our mission goal is to wait for it too happen.

-Solve a puzzle as big as earth but everything will be so out of this world

So yeah it can be anything like that and will be random. Like a dream except this will be a very long time thing that will happen after death and will need to complete it to move on to next life normally or just not exist.

spirituality,What you're all getting wrong about spirituality,"Young Jew here studying at Yeshiva, here's a little bit of wisdom I've learned in my travels said in the best way I can manage in a couple of minutes for a non-Jewish audience.

What is wrong are the words we use to explain ideas. This is both the nature of our reality in that our language we use as a medium to communicate is inherently limited, but this limitation also hinders our ability to rationalize our thoughts into coherent ideas that others can understand as well. You reading this struggle to communicate these esoteric ideas you have. You constantly doubt your knowledge which is rightfully so, and it's mostly brought about by the interactions you have with others who may not agree with you, or at least don't on the surface. We all find our niche in explaining the same deep spiritual concepts which are so profound to us, but to that one person they don't seem to care at all, they may look confused, they may judge, they may not understand, or they may laugh. But at the end of the day, they don't truly disagree with that thing which you are trying to communicate. The fact of the matter is that the words themselves are limiting the scope of your ideas. At the end of the day, people in this subreddit and others who agree with you will still agree with you, but it's not only for them. Spirituality is for everyone to be explained in a way they can understand. By being able to explain deep concepts in every context, this is how spirituality becomes real, tangible, and physical. Then you will start to find the world change before your eyes as you see more of the pieces of truth stitch together to create an image that just keeps getting clearer.

Tl;Dr Know what you don't know, and who the audience you're speaking to is before teaching them a deep esoteric concept. Many times the answer to your deep spiritual question is right in front of you in the physical world.

.


.

In central Africa, the indigenous people known as the Khemets believe that Vibration is Everything. 

Heat is Created by the Vibration of Molecules. Something freezes because its Molecules nearly stop moving Completely.

In order for us to speak, we must first create crude Sound, which then passes through our Vocal Chords and is shaped by our Tongue, Mouth, lips, teeth, etc, into the Frequency, Pitch, and therefore Sound which we Desire.


Another thing I‚Äôve read is that the Khemets also do not believe in literal, fully different Dimensions, but they do have a word that would translate roughly into the English ‚ÄúDimension.‚Äù

Their belief is that we are constantly shifting into Different ‚ÄúDimensions‚Äù every day due to changes in Vibrations and Frequencies.

Anger is a different Vibration/Frequency than Joy/Happiness, which are both different from Grief/Sadness.

Therefore, the Khemetic belief is that, by switching from Happiness to Blind Rage within a mere Moments‚Äô Notice, you are Consciously switching your Reality, your Dimension, from that of a Positive one to a Negative One.


They don‚Äôt believe that we can Actively teleport physically through Wormholes into entirely new Realities where the Laws of Physics are Different and people look differently. 


However, you can change the way you Perceive the Greater World, and therefore, you can Consciously switch ‚ÄúDimensions‚Äù from one of Negativity to one of Positivity by your Own Free Will.


You can actively choose to view people differently by changing your Negativity to Positivity. Instead of seeing people as mean or rude, you can see them as simply Humans trying to exist alongside you.



.


.


I find this to be very Inspiring. I feel it can be seen as both as a Complicated and yet very simple thought process.

You believe that Dimensions Exist, but purely and only in the Context of Emotions and Feelings; Things that we Actually CAN Change.


.


.

Native American Hopis on the other side of the World also have an Interesting belief system too.


They do not dance and sing and play music purely to please Gods and Spirits.

Their belief is that by Dancing and Singing and Creating Music, they are Creating Energy (Which they are because Vibrations are created by the introduced of some kind of Energy. This would be Kinetic energy v√≠a instruments and Dancing), which then Empowers them for months on end.

By focusing so much on their Dancing and Singing and Music, as well as their chanting of phrases possibly similar to ‚ÄúI Am Strong! We Are Powerful! Our Harvest Will Be Great!‚Äù They are focusing their Will on a Specific Goal:

Ensuring A Good Harvest.

After several days, or perhaps even a few weeks, of constant rituals and ceremonies, they begin the Harvest.

They all take extra care and extra caution to properly plant every seed, to then water every seed just enough but not too much nor too little. They even sing happy songs to the plants in an effort to shower them with ‚ÄúPositive Energies.‚Äù 

By the time Harvest comes around, their food supplies are Double that of last years‚Äô harvest! 


But it‚Äôs not because of Gods or Magic. It‚Äôs solely and only because they spent so much time focusing so much of their Will and Energy on one singular Goal: ‚ÄúEnsure Our Harvest Is Bigger and Better Than Ever!‚Äù 


.


.



We could all learn a thing or two from Indigenous peoples, I believe. They have been here for thousands upon thousands of years doing the same things and practicing the same Traditions.


.


For a few days now I‚Äôve been forcing myself to get up and adhere to a semi-strict but also flexible schedule to fix my personal Routine.

My average shifts are 12pm-8:30, so because of this, I tailored my schedule to give me a little extra time at night and still get 7 Hours of Sleep.


To some, 7 hours doesn‚Äôt sound like enough, but trust me, it is.

Buddhist Monks function on 7 hours of sleep every day and some of them also train for 8 and a half hours a day, every single day. 

There are certain Businessmen and Women in this world who can function on 5 Hours of Sleep whilst taking 1-2 hour Meditation breaks once or twice throughout the day.  


It‚Äôs hard to fathom only existing in 7 or even 5 hours of sleep when you‚Äôve spent your whole life sleeping for 10+ hours a night, but trust me, dedicate yourself and force yourself to a schedule and your body will Adapt within mere weeks.


.


My schedule is as follows:


7 Am: Wake Up.


7:00-7:15 Am: Meditate and drink glass of water/ use bathroom.


7:15-7:30 Am: Qigong/Tai Chi (Moving Meditation) 


7:30-8:30 Am: Morning Run/Exercise. Practice Punches, Kicks, do Push Ups, Sit Ups, Squats, Forearm Exercises, Burpees, and Plank. 


8:30-9:30 Am: Make Large Green/Protein Smoothie with breakfast of Choice. Clean up dishes.


9:30-11:00Am: Shower, Get Ready For Work.


11:00Am-12Pm: Leave hour early to ensure proper arrival to work. Meditate for 10-15 minutes while on bus. Eat at work, meditate before clocking in.


12:00-8:30Pm: Work.


8:30-9:30Pm: commute Home, Meditate. 


9:30-10:30Pm: Make a quick and easy dinner like Pesto Pasta with Salmon (Pasta takes 10-15 minutes, salmon takes 3 minutes each side for a total of 6. Cook near end of pasta and it‚Äôs all done at the same exact time). 


10:30-11:30Pm: Free Time.


11:30Pm: Bed Time.



.


.



This gives me personally about 6 and a half hours to 7 hours of Sleep each day, but as you can see, I easily am Meditating for an hour or more in total spread out over the day whilst on the bus and also on my 10 minute breaks at work too.

I personally also use Marijuana quite a bit (I live in California where it‚Äôs almost 100% legal at this point. It‚Äôs almost easier now to legally buy weed than cigarettes here), and even with my daily use I feel great most days with this amount of sleep and this amount of Meditation throughout the day.

The Road To Enlightenment Is Not Easy: The Best Things In Life Are Never Easy To Attain.


If Enlightenment is something you Truly desire, then you have to be willing to Sacrifice your Phone, your IPad, your TV, your Xbox or PS4, etc, and you have to be willing to do what needs to be done to achieve Attain it.


If you think Enlightenment will be gifted to you on a Silver Platter for no reason while you spend your days eating junk food from 7/11 and playing video games for 16 out of the 24 hours in each day; Please reconsider, for you will Not Reach Enlightenment at any point in your Life by doing this to yourself.

.

.

Create a schedule that works for you, force yourself to eat some more fruits and vegetables every day, and start exercising. 


The reason the Shaolin believe their Predecessors incorporated Martial Arts into their daily Routine was to Justify Meditating for sometimes 24 hours or even more. 

If you train for 8 and a half hours every single day, you can therefore end your Day with 5 hours of non-stop meditation and feel Good Knowing beyond Doubt that your body is in Peak Physical Shape.



We all can Achieve Enlightenment, but only if we actually Go for it.

spirituality,NO OTHER SOLUTION BUT TO LOVE GOD,"# NO OTHER SOLUTION BUT TO LOVE GOD

## Meher Baba

 As I said the other day, the gross, subtle, mental and God are all within you in human form. Don't try to find subtle, mental and God in some other world ‚Äî it is *in you* in human form. It is just the change in the vision of consciousness which gives the change of experiencing different planes and worlds.  

Now in the gross world there is human consciousness, and here on this earth and in the whole universe, also in the subtle world and mental world, there are innumerable experiences but the experiences that you have in this gross world, these experiences are quite different from the experiences of the subtle world ‚Äî absolutely different from the subtle world, but it is all *in* you; you don't go anywhere, you do not rise to higher geographical or geometrical levels.  

It is all here, but as the angle of vision changes through experiencing different things, in the end you begin to experience yourself as God; after having a number of infinite experiences, you eventually ultimately experience yourself as God ‚Äî that is the end. That one ultimate experience is the Real experience ‚Äî all other experiences of the gross world, the subtle, the mental, all these experiences are illusory.  

So all states ‚Äî even hell, limbo, worlds, planes ‚Äî are all in you in human form. Don't ask in other places, ask within you. But to eventually become your own Self, you have to love me ‚Äî no other remedy ‚Äî no other solution but to love me.

Why is it that your realization is  called YOUR realization?

You want to know whether or not the realization of another is true or not true. Why? What do you need this information for?

Do  you want to know this so that you know it is safe for you to simply  accept everything the teacher says? To suspend your own judgement, to  suspend your own thoughts and feelings and to just follow another? To  receive knowledge and insight ready-made, handed over to you, by  another? To accept what you hear as the truth because someone told you  that it is the truth?

You  want to make sure that the truth you are accepting is the true truth.  You think that there is a danger to you in submitting yourself to a  truth, to a teacher, to another human, who is ‚Äúfake‚Äù.

But  that is not where the danger is. The danger lies in your submission.  The danger lies in you handing over your responsibility for seeing the  truth to someone else.

If  you submit to another, if you accept another‚Äôs word simply because that  other told you so, then whose realizations are you having? Whose  journey are you on? Whose life are you living?

Not yours.

The  spiritual path is a path to yourself. It is not a path to finding  someone else who tells you stuff. It is a path of you finding who you  are. You, not some guy, not some guru, not some teacher, not some other  human. You.

spirituality,Sharing a post about unusual suicidal feelings,"INTRO :I originally posted this in a christianity sub to Christians. I thought that people in this sub could add their thoughts as I'm interested in your perspective. I use the term ""the earth /God/the universe"" interchangeably. Call it what you want. Also, I'd greatly appreciate if anyone could provide any insight into my experience 



MAIN BODY :Many Christians greatly misunderstand suicide it seems, and I'd like to share my story in hopes that you might better understand.
       I started taking anti depressants as i was extremely depressed. The advice most people give you when you're depressed is to go to therapy and take anti depressants. I took them for a few months. Then I was away from home and didn't pack them. I wouldn't be able to get them, wanted off them anyway and I didn't think they had much of an effect on me. So I stopped taking them, i didn't taper down my dose, i just stopped taking them all together.
      A day or 2 after stopping taking them i felt like i was being called to the ""otherside"", as in death. I felt like the earth or God was calling me to the other side because he wanted me. I walked around with a sense of peace i don't think I'd ever had before, i felt like the world was magical. I felt that i was truly a spirit experiencing this world temporarily as a human. I was sure it would he my last day on earth and it was time for me to leave. I felt lighter than ever, as if i was floating through the world. I was euphoric and everything seemed to shine and glow. 




     Many of you know what it's like to receive a message from God, or the universe, i received one telling me to kill myself because the other side was waiting for me, and i felt loved.





  I felt like i could see life /the material world and death /heaven /the other side of existence simultaneously. I think a thought that's common among depressed/suicidal people is that although they feel suicidal, they also feel like it's deeply wrong.  I felt the opposite. I felt like God was telling me it was my time to go and maybe it was. Maybe it eas because I'd struggled with depression so severely so was offering me a way out. I don't know.




      I'm just sharing this story as many people think that suicide is a rejection of God, moral cowardice and an abandoning of duty, but I've had experiences where, be it because of mental illness, the effects of medication, or an experience with God, I was encouraged to die. If you take instructions from God and God was sending signals to you, that he wanted you to suicide, what would you do? I'm sharing this because I want people who don't understand the struggle of mental illness to possibly better understand it, and appreciate that it's far more nuanced than someone feeling sad and killing themself because they're cowards.

Is the milk, am I the breast? Am I a happy or sad person or am I rich or even a spiritual person for its sake?

A question singular in nature leading to an answer connecting infinite variations. 

A single source, a single pause, a single full stop.

A question of a single sentence, producing thousands of answers, millions of interpretations and billions of realisations.

A realisation of a single relationship leading to multiple orgasms. An orgy of art, scripture and a temple of duality.

Why the heck it exist anyway? How to know what question to ask and why? What is the implication of this dual, full of Maya life? Why suffering has so many answers but none gives permanent solace in the heart? and makes the person pardon his thirst and go fulfilled for a while. Empty water for those tears and that neverending search of Shunnya( zero), Nirvana or Moksha.

The razzmatazz of this all simulation is, there are no right question and wrong answers. But wrong answers and right questions. Bonkers isn‚Äôt it. Yes, see the law book called duality. It‚Äôs disappointing because it doesn‚Äôt give fair justice to your trail. ( that is how it is perceived by everyone who thinks everyone has a better life than his/her life) 

So, what to do? What is the way? What is the purpose?

It is simple ( You might say, are you kidding me, man)

There's a weariness that comes with life for the Elves because they know they are here forever and I think the attitude of the eastern religions is actually quite similar because they believe that this life is no more important than any other that they'll reborn whereas in Western religions you've got the ancient pagan idea that this is the only true life and that the Elysian fields is a mere shade of reality (Achilles wishes he'd lived longer when Odysseus visits him in Hades) and even in the Christian worldview this is the only life on earth and it decides your eternal fate so it's still incredibly important.

spirituality,"If you got a head, 2 arms and 2 legs then you got the opportunity to make other people happy","
By Alessandro Carosi

Sometime we fell sad when we lost a beautiful relationship, sometime we feel sad when we lost our job, members of our family or lost the chance to live in the country we really loved.
We need to be strong cause when we got 1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs and they are healthy you must try everything you can to find inner peace and happiness cause new opportunities will always come along but only if you are happy enough to see it and grab it.

spirituality,New to angel numbers?,"So I'm very very new to all of this spirituality stuff and Im taking things very slow but I do know about angel numbers and that if you keep seeing the same mirror numbers or the same 3 numbers then its an angel or spirit guide sending you a message or a sign right? Well recently I've been noticing angel numbers or atleast repeating numbers but they never seem to be the same ones. I see 11:11 and 20:20 more than the rest (but not like on a daily basis) and I tend to always notice the number 42 idk it just really stands out to me, if I see 4 or 2 in the same number sequence or even better 42 them I'm always like damn... there must be a reason for that ahha. But just for example, just tonight I noticed 21:21, 23:23 and 23:32. All whilst just being on my computer and checking the time. Oh and on friday it was my birthday and I noticed both 11:11 and 19:19. And the funny thing is that when you're looking for the numbers you never see them, it's always by accident! So was tonight just luck seeing all these numbers or is it a sign or a message that I should read into? Because the numbers are not consistent like I'm not constantly seeing 11:11 or 333 EVERYWHERE every other day. Is it maybe just my spirit guides trying to get me to notice them because I'm so new at this but it's not an urgent message so it's not a specific number? Like they're just saying ""heyy heres a mirror number so you notice us, we're just checkin up on ya"" hahah. What do you think?",1604966130.0

spirituality,The main component in spiritual practice.,"There are three aspects of Bhakti which are most important. Unless one does not hear about spiritual topics concerning the Lord, one can never understand the philosophy behind the Bhakti process. One has to realize the importance of the Bhakti process and the basis of spiritual practice. Unless these aspects are taken care of, no one shall be able to begin their journey in Bhakti. The first and the most important aspect here is hearing. Hearing the instructions about the Bhakti process from an enlightened sage is vital. Even the Jnana path recommends hearing about that path by an enlightened master of the path of Jnana. In Jnana the first step is to understand the process from the master, through the hearing process.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJHT6fBw0XM

Welcome to my new series about the esoteric symbolism in storytelling.

This series will give deeper insight into the creativity behind storytelling based upon the myth of our life force, our energy that came down and took upon itself matter.

These stories are about each of us and the raising of energy and evolution back up to the crown, enlightenment.

These stories are so powerful because they speak to our subconscious and create a feeling that reminds us of who we are.  As a filmmaker myself, I‚Äôve always loved the creativity and collaborative adventure of constructing a story, because it is similar to constructing personal reality.

Today I will talk about the film Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan.

This film along with Contact and 2001 Space Odyssey is about the Science of Creation, also known as manifestation.  The creation of an idea.

The space suits represents the human body as it is the home of our consciousness and energy.  The concept of space represents the Mind as the Mind lives in the future with all its dreams and aspirations. Earth represents the past and matter, our physical existence in the body which connects to Earth with its 5 senses.  

This film also incorporates a lot of esoteric knowledge about the this New Age of Magnetism or Aquarian Age and symbolizes references to the masculine and feminine aspects of consciousness and energy.

The act of driving, cycling or swimming is subconscious. The act of some of the habits developed, are conscious. One unconsciously takes out a cigarette, in times of stress. Our whole life is a set of repetitive acts. Thus, remembered acts, build open and define our lifestyle. The remembered acts, being automatic, lack the depth of what pure consciousness is capable of.

spirituality,The Science Behind Mindfulness," 

[Marc Benioff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Benioff), the chairman, and CEO of [Salesforce ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce)was asked how he manages to run one of the most innovative companies in the world. Marc‚Äôs response was an eye-opener. ‚ÄúInnovation is a core value at Salesforce. It is deeply embedded in our culture. This starts in the mindset of every person in the company ‚Äî you must cultivate a beginner‚Äôs mind,‚Äù he pointed.

When pressed further, he revealed that ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs mind is the practice of looking at the world with fresh, unencumbered eyes, and avoiding inside-out or homogenous thinking that can lead to blind spots and missed opportunities.‚Äù

To ensure that employees cultivate the beginner mindset, Mark has ensured that most Salesforce offices have dedicated Mindfulness zones. Employees set aside their phones in a basket as they enter these mindful zones, clear their minds, and embrace ‚Äúshoshin‚Äù ‚Äì beginner‚Äôs mindset, which encourages them to keep an open mind and reflect on any topic.

Marc is not the only Silicon Valley leader who swears by the value of [**mindfulness**](https://www.blacklotus.app/category/mindfulness/). Jack Dorsey- CEO Twitter, Bill Gates, and Jeff Weiner- Founder Linked In, also endorse **mindfulness** as a practice that changed their lives.

spirituality,HOW TO MANIFEST LOVE INTO YOUR LIFE...By Jasmine.,"
Talking about manifesting love and relationships is one of my favorite things to teach on and talk about because it was one of the very first things I began playing with manifestation wise. Growing up I saw dysfunctional relationships all around me. I was not born into a family that taught me about healthy relationships, what it looked like to be in love, or even where to find that.

I remember being 8 years old and listening to my aunt and her husband fight in the other room for the hundredth time that night. I was young, but I decided then and there that I would not have that kind of love. All I knew for sure was the kind of love I had witnessed up until that point which was chaos, fighting, and separation but I was willing to see things differently so like the little scientist I‚Äôve always been at heart, I sat out to look for proof it could be different.

I actually have a memory box of stuff I‚Äôve saved since I was a kid now and one of my favorite things inside of it is a picture of one of my cousins and his girlfriend at the time at a family wedding. It‚Äôs a candid picture the photographer took and they are gazing into each others eyes totally unaware they are being photographed. I remember seeing it in our photo album and feeling my heart swell: they were so in love. It was palpable. The intensity coming from the picture was all the convincing I needed and I took it from the photo album and stashed it in my memory box. On the back I wrote in pen ‚ÄúProof‚Äù.

That was only the beginning for me and I began to hunt for love everywhere I went. At the grocery store, at restaurants we went to, in books, in movies. I began a process I now call when I am teaching manifestation ‚Äúbuilding faith‚Äù. I was changing my mind, little by little and day by day.

As you can tell, I started unlearning all the unhelpful stories about love very early on and began building my faith, setting my intentions, and manifesting what I truly craved: life changing, deep, passionate, beautiful love. As a result, I have very little resistance around love and in this post I‚Äôm going to break down how you can begin to unlearn your own stories about love and how you can manifest you own beautiful love!

1. Start Building Your Faith

The first step is to assess what you already believe about love and relationships. Just like everything else. we are taught rules about things based on what we observed as children from our parents but also the world around us. So the first thing you need to do is ask yourself is do you think true love is even real? And if you do believe it is real, do you believe you can have it? What kinds of things do you find yourself saying about love/dating? If you find that your beliefs and examples of relationships were less than perfect just like I did when I was 8, it is time to start building your faith!
When it comes to the brain we will always find proof of the things we are actively looking for. Start to think about yellow cars and suddenly they are all you will see! Same thing goes for love. Start actively looking for it and you will start to find it everywhere. Just like I did when I was little, start to create a list of every time you observe the kind of love you desire for yourself. This could be seeing couples be sweet to each other in public, this could be seeing the love between people in your own family, or even examples on social media, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. What does matter is that you do this until you believe it is possible and it can happen for you.

Depending on your unique upbringing and life experience you might have a lot to sort through, unlearn, and reprogram. That‚Äôs okay. I had no examples of the kind of relationship I hoped to have when I got older as a kid and for a long time, I didn‚Äôt even believe love was real as a way to protect myself. However, as I started to build my faith those defenses fell away and I began to think that love did not have to look like the chaos I was so familiar with. So start to seek out examples of the kind of love you crave, and begin to disprove the stories that say love isn‚Äôt real, you don‚Äôt deserve it, it‚Äôs hard to find, or whatever other untrue things your brain is telling you. No matter what, the ultimate truth is that you can manifest love and you deserve it.

2. Get Very Specific And Unapologetic

When it comes to how to manifest love and attract a soul partner you need to know what you really want. So many people are caught up in just wanting any relationship that they don‚Äôt think to get clear on what kind of relationship they actually want. When we don‚Äôt set clear standards for things we tend to just manifest whatever we subconsciously expect. Which, if you grew up seeing dysfunctional love, or no love at all is not a good thing. So many people feel like setting too high of a standard makes finding love harder but it‚Äôs not true. It is okay to want what you want and not back down until you get it.
I remember being 14 years old and feeling so weird seeing all my friends have their first boyfriends and get their first kisses and never having had a boyfriend or anything close to one. I remember talking to some of my friends one day and one of them who had just had her first kiss was telling us all about it.

It had been while playing a game of truth and dare and eventually the attention shifted to me as I was the only one hadn‚Äôt ever been kissed or had a boyfriend yet and I was asked why I never went out with anyone. I replied I wanted it to be like the movies and special. Most of friends poked fun at me and laughed saying that it was in the movies for a reason and that it was totally unrealistic to real life. I shrugged and basically channelled Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.

I want the fairy tale. I want the fairy tale. | Pretty woman movie ...
Anyway very shortly after I ended up dating my best friend. On one of our first dates he asked me to go our towns fair and it was one of the most magical days of my life. I had my first kiss on top of the ferris wheel right when the fire works show started. I remember feeling my heart swell and thinking to myself ‚ÄúI waited for this.‚Äù

We dated for years after and it was a transformational experience for me. He was everything I spent my time dreaming about and convincing myself was possible. We were young but that was my very first experience with the kind of love I wanted. He was empathetic, big hearted, and such a romantic. Just like I hoped. I never had any of the terrible experiences many of my friends had when we were teenagers because he was so unlike most of the boys they talked about.

He sent the cheesy texts, he was incredibly emotionally intelligent and helped me heal so many parts of myself, he wrote poems, and best of all he never left me wondering. He was so open, always there for me, and supported me fiercely in every single thing I did. Although it didn‚Äôt work out in the long term, it was a magical experience. I have no doubt now that I manifested him and our relationship together.

I tell you this story to say don‚Äôt let anyone tell you what is unrealistic. I wanted the fairy tale whisked away type of romance and first love and it is exactly what I got. Now I want you to ask yourself what kind of love do you want? What does your dream relationship look like if anything was possible? How does this person treat you? Are they romantic, patient, adventurous, kind? What kind of things do they say to you?

Nothing is too good for you or unrealistic so don‚Äôt censor yourself. I recommend doing this in your journal or the notes on your phone to start setting a standard for the kind of love you are attracting and manifesting. The most important thing to remember is that no matter what you desire, it is out there and you do not have to settle for less.

3. Feel The Feelings Of Love

If you are trying to manifest love it is important you start to surround yourself with these feelings and start feeling them inside. This is super important and what worked for me was watching a lot of romantic movies, reading romance novels, and integrating romance into all areas of my life. With every movie watched and book read, the kind of love I craved became more real and seemed closer and closer. When something really moves you there is rush of emotion that runs through you and that‚Äôs the kind of feelings I want you to create when it comes to love.
What moves each person is different but for me it was definitely movies and books. When I watched or read romantic things I could feel inside myself what the main character was feeling. I would feel after watching those movies or reading those books that love was real, that it was for me, that someone out there would care so deeply for me, take time to understand me, and put in massive effort to be with me. For you it might be music, spending time with other people who are in love, or something else but it doesn‚Äôt actually matter. What matters is creating the feelings of being in love in your body because when you can do that the universe will reflect them back to you very fast and you will attract someone wonderful and manifest love faster than you thought possible.

A lot of dating/love coaches might say watching romance movies and reading love stories might be a bad idea and give you unrealistic or unhealthy expectations but it‚Äôs not really about modeling your relationships after movies but viewing yourself like those main characters. Special, interesting, and worthy of a fantastic and life changing love story. Just like Allie in The Notebook, Vivian in Pretty Woman, and Lara Jean in To All The Boys I loved Before. You are the main character of your own life, so of course magical, fairytale-like, and awe inspiring things happen to you. Of course great love is a part of your story.

So do whatever it takes to inspire those loving feelings inside of you. If you‚Äôre looking for things to watch I honestly recommend Say I do on Netflix. The show is full of beautiful and magical love stories of the kind of stuff that is possible! Even if watching stuff isn‚Äôt your thing find what is and start to really feel it and watch stuff start to unfold and you start to manifest love with ease!

4. Decide You Are Destined For Great Love

When any thought comes up that tries to tell you that what you want isn‚Äôt possible, or it‚Äôs too late, or no one like that exists, remember that because you desire great love that you are destined for it. When you set a new standard for something in your life it is like drawing a line in the sand. From that point on, it is this or something better. That‚Äôs what I want you to do with your love life.
You are special, wonderful, and interesting, of course someone will fall in love with you. Now the question is, will you find someone to fall in love with! I think a lot of the times when we want something so bad we ignore red flags, settle, and put up with things we otherwise wouldn‚Äôt if we didn‚Äôt want the things so bad. But what if you approached love like you were destined to have an amazing love story? What if you were so sure inside yourself that the right person was out there and looking for you too? Every date and relationship you entered would look so different! Because you‚Äôd be certain that no matter what happened with that particular person or date that you were destined for great love, and there was no way you could mess that up.

When you approach love like this, all the pressure to make things work, hold on to people who aren‚Äôt a good fit, or settle fall away because there is nothing you can do to mess it up. You are destined for great love no matter what and if it‚Äôs not them, it‚Äôs someone else. When I began to practice this I experienced the most freedom I ever had in love because there was no pressure to be anything less than who I was. It didn‚Äôt matter if I laughed too loud, ordered a messy burger on a first date, or said the wrong thing because I was destined for great love, and there was no way I could mess that up. I invite you to try on this belief yourself and see how it feels and changes your love life.

5. Remember You Are Complete All By Yourself

When you remember that you are totally complete by yourself you free yourself from desperate energy which makes it harder to manifest love. You don‚Äôt need someone else to be complete. There is no person on planet earth that could make you more cool, interesting, and awesome. You are already all these things. So when you approach love and dating with this energy, there is so much less pressure. You don‚Äôt need someone to complete you because you are already complete! Instead, you are looking for someone to compliment you and support you!
When you approach relationships this way the other person can sense there is no pressure to complete you and instead they can feel free to be themselves and enjoy you instead of worry about completing you. Of course you get to have great love, but you don‚Äôt need it to be complete. It is okay to want it, but when you feel like your worth is dependent on another person it is time to go inward and fill yourself up first.

I hope you enjoyed this post and until next time,

Don‚Äôt give up on your daydreams!

spirituality,Present Release (15),"Comparison. A World we live in through this social realm that allows us to see what someone else is doing INSTANTLY. Support is Great, Support is the sharing of Love between two Beings. There is a Limit though. A Limit that we as human beings don't realize that we go past and allow it to become lost in the past.  
With the constant need of us all to check up on who's doing what, who is where, we have come to a Time, where we have lost our sense of self. Our Sense of Internal Gratitude for Us. With societal norms creating boxes on boxes on boxes of characteristics of what we ""should"" Look Like, how we ""should"" Act, how we ""should"" Be, we have lost who we are.  
It isn't all lost though........  
Realignment can always start again. The Internal Power that comes from being Proud of You, is always there. Its always waiting for your unconscious subconscious realization that we are ENOUGH.   
That by Being we Are Valid.   
We have come to a time where it is so easy to be constantly on every given platform that designers put out with our current lockdown, but........there is TIME.  
There is time, right now for You, Just for You. There is time right now to look inside, to look at who YOU are, what YOU want to do.   
Scary right? Life is.   
It has to be this way though. Most of us can agree that we don't want the same grey line life that is constantly ""coasting"", Well? Make the Change.   
Its All Inside of You &amp; Only You. Waiting........ For You.  
Realign.

spirituality,Vision i believe will come true,"I have been driving to Tennessee, NC, and kentucky with my mom and we have been listening to the book ‚Äúsigns‚Äù. it‚Äôs about receiving signs from loved ones who have crossed over to the other side.

A day after we arrived in NC, we were driving up the mountains to a hike, I had been having a panic attack and a tight pain in my chest, but kept quiet. then my mom says ‚Äúi smell smoke‚Äù and immediately i think ‚Äúher dad‚Äù and she then says ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs my dad‚Äù and we knew he was there. he used to smoke cigars and died of cancer and had had lung problems. i knew he was saying hi to her through me. he had passed before I was born. This then made me 100% believe in signs. I wanted a sign but no human had died that I was close to. 

then the book talked about animals sending signs and my dog Maddie came to my mind. She had passed away when I was 11 (i‚Äôm 17 now. also as i‚Äôm writing this my mom got another sign from her dad, the number 22, his race car number!) anyways, Maddie was my best friend, I slept with her by my side, i played outside with her everyday, we were inseparable. she passed away from liver failure at the age of 7. While listening to this book i kept thinking i wanted a sign from maddie. as I was thinking I started to drift off to sleep, i was half asleep half awake when i got this vision. i‚Äôm about 18 in this vision and there would be a dog with me, my best friend, she would come to me when i needed her, specifically after i broke up with my boyfriend (during this trip my bf and i had a fight and i keep thinking i may need to break up with him in order to grow and have a great life). this vision consisted of that and an image of me and the dog taking walks and driving in my car together with her head on the center console. it was so vivid. she would be a sheep dog, a border collie, same as Maddie. And i could just feel that it was maddie‚Äôs spirit. 

If you‚Äôve read this far id like your input. Do you think I will find this dog? or do you think this image was just a sign from Maddie that she‚Äôs here with me in my heart? Even if it was just a sign, it was a pretty one, and comforted me. I feel like i will come across this dog, but i don‚Äôt want to give my hopes up. I hope you enjoyed the story of the experience i had! let me know what you guys think

EDIT: just found a dog on the side of this country highway. was so sweet and let us pet her and feed her. she wouldn‚Äôt come with us in our car and the animal control place never called us back so we had to leave her but i believe she‚Äôs safe. maybe it was a sign from my old dog!",1603739698.0

spirituality,I apologise to the almighty for mistakenly worshipping my ancestors during the Diwali Puja.,"So, tonight is Deepavali. Me and my parents sat down for our ritualistic pooja. Being a highly spiritual person, I decided to pay my respects to my ancestors as well. Now, i was ignorant of the fact that in Hinduism culture, we arent supposed to put our ancestors photos inside the puja room, reason being, we cannot compare deceased human souls to the almighty powerful force which made all of us and to do that was like comparing both of them. This I got to know, after I had actually worshipped them. I then went within me and searched my feelings, the whole puja, i was feeling apologetic, remorseful and just a feeling came that i had done something wrong. I couldn't feel my ancestors around me anymore. There was just this feeling of 'ooooh i messed up real bad'... but didn't mean to compare anything with anyone. Didn't mean to insult any force. I accept that I was highly ignorant and a mistake was made. 

I am using this platform as a mode of apologies to the universal force which created all of us. Through you, i wish to send my prayers and apologies to the almighty.

My husband and I discovered that our closest friends and part of my family were involved in a satanic group that has heavy involvement in human trafficking, drug trafficking, blood rituals, sacrifices, and cannibalism. When we discovered this, they came after us and our children. We had to leave our life as we knew it, all of our possessions, our home, and flee across country with our 4 children. Took us 2 weeks of nonstop running before they stopped chasing us. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. Once things settled down, we went to begin our new life just for the PNW wildfires to erupt around us, burning down our new home and the forests we came to love. We were trapped in the middle of these fires, in our truck with our kids, for 2 days before we could find an open road. I had a cousin on the east coast who insisted over and over to drive out to him, that he'd help us. Spent the rest of our pandemic stimulus check to get out there, just to stay for one night and then be told that he changed his mind and we had to go that day with no explanation. Now we're trying to go back west, broker than ever, and our little bit of unemployment is not carrying us well. 

We've been here stranded in a parking lot the past 4 days with no gas and now almost out of food. Unemployment still doesn't come in for 3 more days, security and police keep harassing us. Prostitutes and druggies all around us... Just can't catch a fucking break anywhere.

All through this, I have prayed and followed what God and my heart tell me, but it's gotten us no where. Missions and churches have been less than helpful, especially with the pandemic going on. We have no friends or family left. I've dedicated my life to the Lord, kept my faith up through all of this, kept my heart to still be kind, compassionate and considerate of others, but I'm feeling so dejected and hopeless that I just can't see the good in any of it. It hasn't gotten me anywhere but in the most fucked up of situations.  I have 4 young kids who are dying for a home and stability, and all I can do right now is keep them safe and their basic needs cared for while stuck in a parking lot of a bad area.

I don't know what my purpose is here, or why I'm bothering to write this. No one's believed my story so far...not friends, family, police, fbi, us marshall's, strangers.... I have to be strong for my kids, but I'm so fucking weak in spirit right now. It's been 7 months since we were run out of our home and not one thing has worked out or improved. I need hope. I need faith. I need ideas of how to get out of this. I need out of this city. I need a home for my kids. I need peace. I need so much that every person goes silent, because what can you even say???

spirituality,How YOU can channel your highest guides - easily!," 

Hi everyone,

Today I channelled a message from God, or the Divine I AM. This message is a guided meditation on how you can channel your highest guides. Here is the message I hope you like it:

""Hello hello hello this is the Divine I am here today with a message about specific channelling and how to access your higher consciousness. Now many of you may wish to channel for yourself so you can reliably hear your guides, if you do this you will be able to let go of what is happening that is not serving you and allow your highest guides to communicate with you every single day. Now channelling is not for everyone, if you feel threatened of vulnerable to psychic beings that are not of the light then do not channel. If you channel and you are vulnerable then negative beings, then they can access your aura and bring you down as well as guiding you in the wrong direction, so lets do a little test to see if you are ready to channel. One, put your hand over your heart and say this, ‚ÄúI am now ready to let a little of God‚Äôs light run through me and channel through me, I am now ready to let go of what has been and to move into a higher state.‚Äù If you felt true as you said those words then you are indeed ready to begin channelling.

Now channelling needs quite a lot of physical vitality for it can be draining so if you are feeling low or drained maybe try this another time, there is always another chance to do this again later if you feel like now is not the time for any reason. I want you to realise that channelling will totally change the way you live your life and everything you do will be blessed as if God himself was with you every single day in everything you touch, I will be as I say this now, imagine a shower of light comes down from my heart to you and blesses you: You are now ready to receive this transmission of divine light, open your heart my beloved ones and let go of your fear, I am here and I say this: No one who is not ready to receive will be reading this message so if you are here then you are indeed ready to relax and let go and receive a waterfall of divine light. Imagine this waterfall touches every pore of your being and goes into the deepest part of your heart and your soul and feel as I cleanse every particle of dust, dirt or debris from your soul now. Now just count to three and at the end close your eyes for a few minutes and feel that you are being held my me, your father, the one the creator.

Now that you have relaxed I want you to open your heart once more as wide as you can, imagine a golden waterfall is coming through you from your heart to your toes and you are going even deeper into this meditation. Now open again to me, and feel me being right with you.

Now we are going to open you to a divine being who will assist you to begin channelling for your own wishes. This being is Amriel who is a star being and angel and can help anyone to learn to channel. Imagine a golden angel is Infront of you and she is going too offer you a lesson on how to become an empath and a golden divine angel, for you will be an angel after you have finished my guidance on this learning to channel. Now imagine Amriel is saying ‚Äúnow my beloved please let go of the thought that I will not be able to hear anything, you will hear and you will channel. Don‚Äôt worry if it feels frustrating or not as easy as you had hoped, you can and will channel a message from me now. I want you to release the part of your mind that says ‚ÄúI am not a channel and I cannot do it‚Äù and instead think ‚ÄúI am a channel and I can channel‚Äù. Write down three things you think that you are not able to channel about and then imagine you send this piece of paper into Gods heart and he says ‚ÄúNo no no, these are not right‚Äù, I tear up these three thoughts and replace them with ‚ÄúI am going to show you how to be an angel, a channel and a divine being walking upon my paradise of the Earth. If you ever felt alone or lost and afraid now you will be able to access the highest guides who will help you with everything you are feeling and make you feel good again‚Äù.

So now I want you to imagine that one of these beings is Golden and there is another here who is Blue, this is the Archangel Michael who is going to guarding you as you write this message. All of us are around you now with a golden bubble of light so nothing that is not from God can enter you at all. Nothing. Now I want to you feel that your angel Amriel is going to channel through you now, feel her as being right with you like a light Infront of you and say this ‚ÄúAmriel, I accept you into my heart, I am now ready to receive your transmission of love and healing and I will write whatever you say to me without correcting or editing it in any way‚Äù. Good now get a piece of clean paper, not dirty paper not used paper, a nice clean piece of new unused paper. Now open your heart and begin to write whatever comes into your mind. Just let the pen move itself and dont interfere of correct any of it, let the entire message come through and then just relax and smile and breath. You have now channelled! Yay! Well done dear ones. Now you can do this again and again you do not need to rely on anyone to tell you what your guides say except your own imagination and your highest angelic channelling guide. Of course you may wish to still seek out one who is very proficient at channelling for these messages can be quite amazing and even give you blessings you never imagined if done correctly, but from now on you will be able to receive at least one little piece of advice at a time and maybe even better than this if you practice this technique at least once per day.

Do try to channel as often as you can and always, always call in high level protection before you begin, I cannot emphasise this enough, if you do not protect your energy field before channelling then you open yourself up to all kinds of energies you would rather not have connected to you. So now dear ones do you want to know what is the best way for you to connect with your higher self? Of course it is channelling, so do this as often as you can and always protect yourself from lower beings who do try to harm those that channel if they can because they are here to rob humanity and create more destruction. So don‚Äôt let that happen and you will channel always a guide of the highest light and of the highest love and you will learn soon to open to a new level of protection and happiness and amazing things will begin to emerge for you and for all others who do this exercise.

spirituality,"An anecdote about depression, suicide and anti depressants.","Many Christians greatly misunderstand suicide it seems, and I'd like to share my story in hopes that you might better understand.
       I started taking anti depressants as i was extremely depressed. The advice most people give you when you're depressed is to go to therapy and take anti depressants. I took them for a few months. Then I was away from home and didn't pack them. I wouldn't be able to get them, wanted off them anyway and I didn't think they had much of an effect on me. So I stopped taking them, i didn't taper down my dose, i just stopped taking them all together.
      A day or 2 after stopping taking them i felt like i was being called to the ""otherside"", as in death. I felt like the earth or God was calling me to the other side because he wanted me. I walked around with a sense of peace i don't think I'd ever had before, i felt like the world was magical. I felt that i was truly a spirit experiencing this world temporarily as a human. I was sure it would he my last day on earth and it was time for me to leave. I felt lighter than ever, as if i was floating through the world. I was euphoric and everything seemed to shine and glow. 




     Many of you know what it's like to receive a message from God, or the universe, i received one telling me to kill myself because the other side was waiting for me, and i felt loved.





  I felt like i could see life /the material world and death /heaven /the other side of existence simultaneously. I think a thought that's common among depressed/suicidal people is that although they feel suicidal, they also feel like it's deeply wrong.  I felt the opposite. I felt like God was telling me it was my time to go and maybe it was. Maybe it eas because I'd struggled with depression so severely so was offering me a way out. I don't know.




      I'm just sharing this story as many people think that suicide is a rejection of God, moral cowardice and an abandoning of duty, but I've had experiences where, be it because of mental illness, the effects of medication, or an experience with God, I was encouraged to die. If you take instructions from God and God was sending signals to you, that he wanted you to suicide, what would you do? I'm sharing this because I want people who don't understand the struggle of mental illness to possibly better understand it, and appreciate that it's far more nuanced than someone feeling sad and killing themself because they're cowards.

At first I thought it just a coincidence or that I was somehow influencing this observation by my subconscious mind telling me to look at the clock on my phone at that time or whatever. For a period of about 3 days or so at my rapid paced work I consistently had 42 unread emails in my inbox for example, but it's got stranger and more persistent as time has gone by.

Speaking with colleagues at work they've just come out with the number to indicate how many of a certain thing they've got left to do. Looking on a chart or website I see 0.42% for something else. I get home and there's something on the news with the number on the screen, maybe it's 142 rather than 42 but it's still got 4 and 2 together!

spirituality,"‚ù§Ô∏èPresent Moment Awareness ,Pure Consciousness,Pure Awareness,Awareness free of thoughts,Liberation,Oneness.üòÉ","

Mankind for all these years has been identified with ‚Äúthinking‚Äù as a means to work out life. Very few humans, in the past, have transcended thinking to experience a higher way of living which is rooted in the intelligence of the pure consciousness or presence.

However, the present age is the time of awakening, and more and more humans are waking up to the truth of their nature, to their true identity, which then allows them to live in a new way.

The Practice of Being in the Present Moment

The practice of living in the now, or present moment awareness, is an opening into waking up our ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù from being identified with a pseudo-identity created by the mind. Once consciousness becomes free of mind identification it leads to ‚Äúself-realization‚Äù and a new way of living free of suffering and struggle.

Awakening is a process of self-realization where we realize that who we are is essentially ‚Äúpure consciousness‚Äù and not an image based ‚Äúego‚Äù identity created by the mind. The ego by itself is not a problem but once consciousness loses itself into believing that it‚Äôs the ‚Äúego‚Äù it leads to suffering and struggle, as experienced by most humans.

The practice of staying in the now helps free the consciousness from this identification, and leads to an awakening. Many people who are new to this practice have questions about being in the present. Here are a few pointers which will guide you with this practice.

1.) The Now is All There is, Stay Conscious of It
Many people who start practicing staying in the now (or staying present), are confused about how to focus on the now.

Staying in the now is not about ‚Äúfocusing‚Äù on a moment in time, but about staying ‚Äúaware‚Äù or alert, instead of being lost in thoughts.

When you initially start practicing ‚Äúpresence‚Äù you will notice that you cannot retain your presence for more than a few seconds before your consciousness is dragged into thoughts.

As your practice continues, your presence will become stronger and stronger, while the hold of your mind will become weaker. It won‚Äôt be long before you realize that you are not the thoughts, or a thought based identity, but pure consciousness who is the ‚Äúwitness‚Äù of everything.

This ‚Äúawareness‚Äù is who you essential are and it‚Äôs eternal, the creator of all forms, the one being and when it becomes aware of itself it awakens to it‚Äôs existence ‚Äì this is awakening or enlightenment. Once it wakes up to itself, it moves away from it‚Äôs preoccupation with ‚Äúthinking‚Äù and moves into ‚Äúbeing‚Äù, which is a highly intelligent state of existence.

2.) Presence is a State of No Thinking
It‚Äôs important to know that the state of presence is about being alert without ‚Äúthinking‚Äù, but that does not mean that no thoughts will arise in the mind. Thoughts may arise in the space of your mind, and move in and out, but your practice should be to stay aware without being taken up by these thoughts.

Presence is a state of being not a state of thinking, but thoughts can arise in the state of alert presence. Once ‚Äúawareness‚Äù becomes strong, it will not be taken up by thoughts, but will stay as a steady current of consciousness, which in essence is a state of high wisdom and intelligence.

3.) Being Present Will Take Some Effort
Staying in the present moment is a state of alertness, and initially it does require effort on your part. All along you have been addicted to thinking, and there is a tremendous attraction created by every ‚Äúself based‚Äù thought that enters your mind.

To stay in the now one has to start disengaging from this addiction to thought, and like all addictions it takes time and effort to get kick the habit. Once you put in the effort to strengthen your awareness, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before you wake out of your mind based identification and move into living life directly from the presence of your being, in pure awareness every moment of your day.

Remember that ‚Äúyou‚Äù are ‚Äúawareness‚Äù, and it‚Äôs only due to language that it appears as if there are two, when there is only one.

4.) Be Steady with Your Practice of Staying Alert
Don‚Äôt be discouraged when you see yourself getting pulled into thoughts while you practice staying in the now. It will take time before your awareness becomes strong enough to resist the pull of thoughts.

It may take a few months to a year, before your consciousness wakes up fully from mind identification and starts moving through life without constantly being pulled into ‚Äúthinking‚Äù.

When consciousness starts moving by itself, without needing to check up with the mind, it moves in a highly intelligent manner and the power that has created this universe is unleashed to start creating autonomously, this opens up the potential for untold grace and abundance.

5.) Being Present is About Waking Up Awareness
All spiritual teachers have pointed to the normal waking state, in un-awakened humans, as a ‚Äúdream state‚Äù where awareness is identified with thoughts and though based identity.

Awareness ‚Äúthinks‚Äù of itself as a person and takes on all the limitations of that come with the external human conditioning ‚Äì this is a highly powerless state. Nothing in the world of forms has any true existence without the light of consciousness shining on it, that‚Äôs the power of consciousness.

But when this consciousness is lost in thoughts and is identified with the mind, this pure intelligence becomes powerless.

When you stay in the now, by keeping your attention on the present moment without being lost in thoughts, this consciousness, which you are, start waking up from mind identification and automatically becomes ‚Äúself aware‚Äù i.e awareness becomes aware of itself as awareness.

This is the goal of staying in the now, and once this is accomplished, awareness will automatically start taking over from the mind and this will lead to a way of living which is free of fear, suffering and struggle, and is full of abundance and well-being.

In Conclusion

So in summary the question of how to stay in the now can be answered in three simple pointers:

Keep your awareness from being lost in thoughts.
Stay only as awareness without needing to gain identity from the mind.
Don‚Äôt fall for the mind which will try to constantly trap your attention.
If you keep at the practice of being in the present moment, your consciousness will grow in power and will start becoming free of mind. Just be patient with yourself, this process usually takes close to a year before consciousness is truly free of the mind and realizes itself as being the one true ‚Äúreality‚Äù. Once consciousness starts moving as consciousness, it creates beautifully, without any struggle or suffering.",1605720704.0

spirituality,"Just fed up with this ""time is fluid"" and ""manifestation"" spirituality","We could just start using assertiveness and ambition as a synonym for manifestation because practically ""aligning your actions with your desired outcome"" is ""working for your goals"".

It just feels like scam, an excuse to remain blind to that you may not be given what you want no matter how much work you do for it... it's like trying to run in quicksand really. Time may be fluid but hell I don't have my whole life to wait even my simplest desires to manifest! I've been trying to manifest a loyal friend for lifetime to do certain things with (that will stay off reddit) and been very very specific and visualising what I want... for years. After failures, alone times, aura cleansing, I've tried everything that law of attraction and manifestation guides teach me? Do I still have this loyal friend? No. Last time I actually believed my manifestation had worked, even so well that I started wondering if this friend had studied me on social media for knowing so much what I want or if I manifested her... after finding her bail on me on very important matter and digging some, I found indeed she had done research behind my back. And I forbid cheating and disloyal friends, for gods sake, I hate disloyalty and flakiness, especially when the person isn't like at risk of losing their life, job, home, money etc but could ""do the right thing to me"" like a friend should. I cut that person off instantly after questioning her motives... that were just that ""she was playing, shouldn't be so serious"". And I was dead-serious when I was doing manifestation work for this friend... Do I have others around me fitting those qualities I'm trying to manifest? No. They've been asked to come clean if they're around.

Don't believe in this ""share your manifestations and affirmations online"". People will just gather the info and sell a well-crafted version of your desired stuff to you, but in the end you'll be left with less than you have. Nothing you get is long-term apparently, they just want to rip you off all the time. Even if you got something ""inside"" that's going to be only inside your head, self delusion in other words... where's the external manifestation of those desires? You'll never be sure when it'll come and how long you'll have it, so why waste your time on uncertainity and chasing carrots on stick that will be pulled away from you once you're about to catch them?

The universe has shown me this through 30 years. I've never had what I wanted.. barely even a slice, no matter how simple or grounded my goals would be. Sure, I can manifest x amount of euros by working for it. But what about a loyal friend or loving mate (details don't belong to reddit, yes I've written very specific details on a paper and at some part of my life even tried to be vague just to ""let go of control"" as they say).

It's just deceit and scam. Bring quaranteed rewards and I'll do work, on material or spiritual realm. But I'm tired of chasing what may never happen during my physical lifetime. And I'm tired of waiting, willing and hoping.",1605583190.0

spirituality,My journey so far,"It started when I was born with a 1000 gramms in the 6th month.. Almost died after birth and my mom also almost died.

I was a lonely child and only had 1 friend(michelle) in the village here in austria when I was a kid..

I always believed in magical stuff and growing up I watched a lot if magicians and started doing cardistry and card magic at age 14ish

Also at about age 12 or 13 I became a ""witch"" or ""warlock"" or whatever and started believing in mother nature and abilities like influencing the weather.

That morphed into be simply being spiritual and believing in a higher power.. Nature, the universe, .. Potato potato..

I also had my fair share of other gods I believed in like odin (reason for my name.. And also Im in a viking club), lucifer.. Even cthulhu at one point..

I was sick of believing so many things so I merged every version of a higher power into one entity.. Be it the universe or omnipotent, multidimensional beings like the maschine-elves. We cant know for certain so for me everythings abstract.

At some point I started smoking mary jane and that catapulted everything.

I just kept growing and growing spiritually until I encountered a strange feeling called the messiah complex.. I believed I might be some sort of messanger, maybe even a god.. A god of my own universe that is (my reality)

I was riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave (if you know that reference youre a G)

I never had a truly challanging time in my life as I always had my spirituality..

Then I took some acid wbut the set and setting wasnt right so that planted a dark and bitter seed inmy brain.. It feeds on my energy to grow...now it has catapulted me into the most terrifying depths of reality.. Call it psychosis if you like, I see this as a test to see if Im worth ith to ascend into an even higher state of consciousness.. Ihave to see the ugly and terrifying realities that might be possible to truly appreciate what was given to me those years ago.

I am doing better at the moment, otherwise this text would be much darker and depressing.

We live so many lives that eventually we'll either go to heaven or hell because of our accumulated ""karma"". If you become very conscience you can remember previous lives.

spirituality,Limits and Boundaries,"‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt serve two masters.‚Äù That is absolutely correct. I serve no man. 

My master is myself. 

I am my own guru, I challenge everyone. I will kill Buddha when I see him, no doubt about that. You sure about that Buddha? I‚Äôm from the show-me state ; ) show me whatcha got or you gonna die. 

Herman Hesse knew. Siddharta meets the Buddha and was like ‚Äúbro, you sure?‚Äù I‚Äôm paraphrasing, of course. But that‚Äôs the gist of it. He finds enlightenment by the river eating his bananas, mourning his sons departure back into ego-land. Which by the way, bananas are the best fruit‚Äîthey come with their own wrappers. 

Who doesn‚Äôt want to have their limits challenged? The one who questions will find their way as questions leave our mental boundaries open to new answers. This is why I am my own master. I seek dominion over myself through questioning. 

Before this last chapter in my life began, I knew I‚Äôd be working through the knots of my solar plexus chakra. Personal power‚Äîthe best kind is quiet power, in my semi-humble opinion. 

I‚Äôm unassuming for a reason. Hahaha I don‚Äôt know what to do with it anyway... I prefer my power quiet; I prefer my riots classy. Let‚Äôs fight fair. I‚Äôll show you where my loose bricks lie, but if you start tossing them, shows over. I‚Äôm out. 

Boundaries are essential, agreements are important. Fair negotiation is what is needed to open things up.

spirituality,Something that came to me...,"I posted this in the awakened Reddit and was basically told to put it here because it didn‚Äôt fit. I don‚Äôt get it, if they‚Äôre awakened why wouldn‚Äôt they feel this way too or at least get it? I consider myself to be awake AND spiritual AND enlightened and lots of things, do semantics really matter? This puzzles me but whatever, here it is....

I feel like so many people are struggling right now. We‚Äôre butting heads in the US, we can‚Äôt seem to get anywhere, this feeling of I‚Äôm right and you‚Äôre wrong-not understanding how someone could believe what they believe. 
We‚Äôre stressed out, scared, confused, and things are uncertain and we don‚Äôt have the leadership that‚Äôs helping us. The covid epidemic is the worst it‚Äôs ever been and nothing is changing and that‚Äôs madness. Politics is divisive, people are disowning kids and family over this crap, long life friends are no longer friends, people are getting so frustrated, angry, hateful, mean, delusional, and it‚Äôs hurting everyone in some way. 
We can‚Äôt fix this by saying I‚Äôm right and you‚Äôre wrong, we can‚Äôt fix it with anger, fear, blame, corruption, control, hate or division. 
We have to agree on something-
We all want: 
peace, harmony, 
to do well enough financially at least to not worry about buying groceries or paying bills, 
for everyone we love to be happy and healthy, 
to have purpose, to laugh and enjoy life, 
we want good sex and someone to belong to, we want to feel good about ourselves, 
we want to feel safe and secure, 
we want to feel free to be ourselves. 

Can we get there the way we‚Äôve been doing it? We‚Äôve made progress, the spiritual community, the collective consciousness is firing up, this year has been insane, so many are waking up-but if we keep approaching it from this view of being right or wrong, or with fear or anger we aren‚Äôt going to get anywhere. 

Everyone wants the same things underneath it all. Remember that, we just all have different perspectives based on our experiences, our wounds, our beliefs. You can‚Äôt fix everyone but you can choose to not stir up that low vibrational crap. Rise above the fray. Be smarter. Be the good guy. Be better. 

Spread the love y‚Äôall! 
Slow down, relax, go within, focus on the basics, and just love everyone no matter what. If that‚Äôs too hard be a hermit and find your own inner peace, but don‚Äôt add to the vitriol in this world right now. I know it‚Äôs hard, I have very strong opinions and feelings too about everything, but fighting with those with diametrically different opinions isn‚Äôt going to do anything but make me mad and ruin my day, it solves nothing. 
We‚Äôre finding people won‚Äôt budge, especially those who are filled with hate and are closed minded, so leave it there-for your own peace of mind. 
We‚Äôve got to do better, and you know better. I certainly was getting wrapped up in it, very disillusioned about the state of my country and more. 
Lead with love. Get centered and peaceful again, let it unfold, stop trying to control things outside of yourself. Do your best and let go of the rest. Trust that everything we‚Äôve gone through is for a reason and that we‚Äôre going to fix this-with love.",1605123567.0

My mother told me these things are happening because I have too many open doors, and her solution is to just believe that the doors are closed.

The reason I'm asking is I just had a conversation with my therapist about my spirituality and how I've been trying to understand and figure out what it is that I believe, and my therapist said that they think I have a stronger sense of my core beliefs (of how to treat people and how to interact with the world around us with respect, etc) than what I think. I realised that is true, and that what I've actually been struggling with is how to incorporate those beliefs into my daily life in a way that honours those beliefs and my spiritual side.

I have PTSD as a result of an abusive upbringing (which in many ways was cult-like when it came to religious and spiritual practices and teachings), so I'm trying to redefine how I relate to my spirituality.

spirituality,My Spirit Guide is Lilith?,"I am still at the very beginning of my journey and just thought I would share my first experience meeting my spirit guide, so anyone with more experience could give me their input/advice on my progress.

Last night, I felt very inclined to try a meet your spirit guide meditation again because I had met some of my ancestor guides the night before but that is a whole different story. Point is: I was inspired! 

I could already tell that I was going to have a good meditation because I could feel myself complying to what the guide of the meditation was saying before he even said it, so my intuition was in a good place. 

When I got to my meeting place (a meadow with lots of tulips (I'm not particularly fond of tulips so if they have any kind of meaning please lmk)) I could see myself sitting in a place with short cut grass that was the perfect light green and soft. I usually get to this place but nothing usually comes to meet me, so I was very surprised when I saw a beautiful, tall lady walking another path cut out in the grass over towards me. She sits on her knees, resting back on her heels, and hold my hands as I am not sitting in the same position across from her. She was kind of lowering her head so I couldnt get a clear look at her face, I was mostly seeing her hand which had on black silk gloves with a lace detail around the wrist. 

I asked what her name was and I heard aries which is the most confusing part of this all but I didnt realize that until afterwards. I asked her what kinds of things she likes: black (preferably) or red candles, shiny jewelry, and vanilla scents. She gave me some general advice on questions I kept answering (shes a little sassy and said ""yes, yes, yes! stop asking the same question and just listen to your instincts"") She also very often included the phrase ""my child"" when responding to me. 

Before we left I asked if she could take her hood off so I could see her. She did, but I only saw her bright red hair and horns which pointed back and down ending around her shoulder blades. 

Now back to the fact that I think this is actually Lilith is for one Aries is a man and before I even saw the figure I could sense a womans presence, so this didnt make any sense to me. It did at first because of the ram-like horns she had but thinking about it more I was confused. So I looked Aries up and found out that he had a sister names Eris. She looked sort of similar to the figure I saw, but Eris doesn't have red hair. I thought maybe she changed it to impress me or something, so I kind of just accepted it and thought my spirit guide was Eris. 

That was until I woke up this morning and every time I thought about it I kept thinking ""Lilith"" in the place I should have thought ""Eris"". I did another meditation just on my own without a meditation guide for some clarity on the subject and kept hearing someone tell me to ""just relax"". When I got to the point of relaxing I saw the image of a snakes face right in front of mine. I immediately opened my eyes after that as if that was the answer I was looking for, so I decided to look up Lilith because I didnt know much about her but I knew there is a correlation with her and snakes. 

When I saw the google images that came up of her I was in shock at how accurate the google images were with who I saw, but at the same time I was almost expecting it at that point. 

That is basically my whole experience now. I am going to try to connect with her again, but I havent seen much about Lilith being a spirit guide and want to know if anyone else has her as a guide or knows about her as a guide because I am so interested in doing as much as I can to keep her happy and learn more about her. 

My last random bit is that I have also been craving hot tea lately which I dont really like and I heard that having unusual cravings is common, so if anyone knows if hot tea is a favorite of hers lmk.",1604970138.0

Needless to say it didn‚Äôt last long. But I‚Äôm just confused. How could I back then think I knew everything?

I do not urge anyone whatsoever to agree with me, if they feel so. However I am inspired to write a few lines, based on very personal realizations. I wish to seek deep pardon, from the kind people who may feel singled out or people who may carry feelings of hurt after having read this article. I humbly ask forgiveness of everyone who feels implicated, after having read this article.

In the arena of spirituality two words are interchangeably used. They are ‚ÄúFaith‚Äù and ‚ÄúBelief‚Äù. Their usage in spirituality is so rampant that one is often used in place of the other. This piece, aims at taking a plumb into these two words. It may perhaps help the sincere seeker, to locate his own barometer, in his journey towards his core, through the process of differentiating between these words...

Few days ago I was studying and thinking about it, I was feeling strangely overwhelmed, hoping I‚Äôd get a sign what should I do about it. As I was deep in my thoughts, the ringing started and I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but I felt like there was a ‚Äúpassage‚Äù, it was high pitched at first, then there was static and all of the sudden weird silence but almost if someone was mumbling in the distance and I don‚Äôt know why I did it but I felt someone was with me and I freaked out and said ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù. Then there was this high pitched noise again and I‚Äôm not even kidding but I felt the passage closing in my ears. I‚Äôve read that sometimes someone higher is trying to send you a message, like, send you a warning about something and I just don‚Äôt know what to think about it.

spirituality,"Taking the support of my Soul, O my Mind, you are actually making my Soul dance...","Taking the support of my Soul, O my Mind, you are actually making my Soul dance.

You are fickle in nature! Why do you change the calmness of Soul also in fickleness.

You have the same attribute of fickleness in young as well as old, your character never changes.

This Soul is tired of you, O Mind, still it doesn‚Äôt leave you.

This Soul believes you to be his companion, and you, on the other hand keep searching for every thing else.

This is so pitiful since many lives, you are so far apart, but distance keeps fluctuating from near to far every time.

Soul is always longing for Supreme Soul and Mind always wants to stay immersed in Maya (illusion), never wanting to come out.

Kaka is explaining, how one cannot achieve liberation if there is no synchronisation between Soul and Mind! Inherent need of Soul is to merge with Supreme Soul and inherent need of Mind is illusion-desires, temptation, greed, egoism, lust and so on. Though Soul is embodied in this body and also with this mind, they are far apart. It is very important for Mind to coexist with Soul in harmony for achieving self awareness. Goal of spirituality and spiritual practice is to identify the stillness and not movements. Mind energy of egoism needs to merge with Divine energy of stillness. Which is achievable with practice of meditation and prayers.

We did esctasy related activities and pulled an all nighter. I was honestly at the happiest I'd ever been. Around 5 am we were sitting on the bed and I was half asleep half awake. When I went to get up to go get a drink I did just without my body. I instantly felt weird, turned around and saw myself and freaked the fuck out. The next few days I was convinced I had died.

spirituality,It‚Äôs Okay to Not Be Okay,"You‚Äôre struggling. You‚Äôre angry, depressed, anxious‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre angry about being depressed and anxious, ha ha. Negative emotions suck donkey doo doo. You‚Äôre not emotionally where you want to be, and that‚Äôs okay.

When you‚Äôre trying to be a happier and more understanding person, it can be easy to create an unrealistic expectation that you‚Äôre never allowed to feel any negative emotion. This impossible expectation causes you to feel self-invalidated, which then ironically prolongs and intensifies your anger and powerlessness.

You‚Äôre going to feel sad and depressed sometimes. You‚Äôre going to be happy one minute, and then break down crying in the shower the next. And then go to work with a smile on your face.

You‚Äôre going to feel angry sometimes. You‚Äôre walking around stores, feeling good, and then someone is rude, and now you‚Äôre pissed. You watch how disrespectful people can be and it causes you to want to punch them in the face so hard that they go flying back ten feet, leaving a crater blast in a concrete wall from your One-Punch-Man level of strength. And also wonder if you‚Äôre wrong for wanting to say something to let them know that their behavior is rude so they can improve (because they either genuinely don‚Äôt know and no one told them, or they just don‚Äôt care).

You‚Äôre going to feel anxious sometimes, and worry about if and when things will work out for you.

You‚Äôre going to feel guilt, shame and regret sometimes, about how you reacted to people and situations. Berating yourself; wishing you had done better.

You‚Äôre going to feel unworthy sometimes. Remembering how bullies treated you ten to twenty years ago in school, or how your parents text you nagging or abusive things just to make you feel like shit.

You‚Äôre going to feel bad sometimes... And that‚Äôs ok. There are no rules; there are no standards to being human. You‚Äôre doing the best that you can. Feeling afraid, or unworthy, or angry, does not diminish you in any way. It just gives you the opportunity to be a little bit more self-aware and reflective of the kind of person you want to be moving forward.

It‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre far too hard on yourself. And even if you are hard on yourself, that‚Äôs okay, too. You are great. And you‚Äôre stumbling around, trying to figure out life like the rest of us. We are all in this together ‚Äî We really are all idiots lol. But we‚Äôre learning, and even if you just take one baby step forward, that‚Äôs fantastic!

If all you did today was put on pants, when you haven‚Äôt been able to get out of bed for two days straight because of depression ‚Äî Congratulations.

If all you did was think ten mean things, and you only said eight of them to someone ‚Äî Congratulations.

If you feel like unlovable trash, but put your hand on your heart and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do a little bit better to be nicer to myself,‚Äù ‚Äî Congratulations.

Everything you do is progress to who you want to become. Congratulate ALL progress; not just the big leaps forward.

Don‚Äôt diminish your journey or the rate of your growth; there is no standard of speed to you becoming the person you or others think you should be. You are who you are now; and who you are now is more than enough.

**Be easy on yourself for being hard on yourself.**

***When you let it be okay, to not be okay, then it‚Äôll be okay.***

For my first piece of work I did a collaboration with the *Holy Spirit* and put together a message for everyone *(John 16:13)*. God has been speaking to me for a while now and He has urged me to get this message out to as many people as I can, to be honest I‚Äôm not really sure how to do that but I know all things are possible through Him. If We can reach just one heart and turn them to repentance I know Our work has been fulfilled.

In *Finding Jehovah: The Path to Life* it was Our intention to remind you of your divinity, of your relationship with the sole creator of the Universe and His son whom He sent down as a remission of your sins. Jehovah wants a personal relationship with you, so We invite you to look within yourself and see the love that God has had for you since the beginning of time. This is a short simple book to understand and neither a christian faith nor a belief in God isn't required to grasp the core message - Love. Come, take a journey with Us into your heart and let the love of Christ wash away all your sins as you return to the light you‚Äôve always been and remove the forgetfulness of your oneness with God. 

Thank you brothers and sisters for your consideration, and God bless you.

Still, I found that quite odd if I was indeed in fact Marie Laveau. As a teen I could always hear songs on the radio before it was even turned on, I also dreamed of car crashes the night before it happened to family members. Once, I even drew a ton of Wiccan symbols without knowing what it was, adding little stars around it. That caused my family to perform a fake exorcism on me. No joke. I remember hissing, and I must have passed out from pressure because I don‚Äôt know what happened after that. Must have drugged me.

spirituality,"I've read that we aren't aware of 90% of what is going on around us. (In terms of energy, electromagnetic fields, vibrations, spirits, angels, brainwaves, wavelengths, frequencies and ect.)","

Personally I believe in this especially because I've experienced a lot of events that many would consider ""weird, hallucinations, paranormal and spiritual"".

For example, I went to bed to my girlfriend who just had fallen asleep a couple of minutes earlier and right after laying down I saw this glowing green orb exiting her body, coming in front of me as if it was looking at me and then reversing outside my bedroom window.
I'm 100% sure it was her Spirit.(light body or whatever you wanna call it.)
One time I was Meditating ""Buddha style"" with my eyes halfway closed and saw this huge glowing golden orb approach me.

Nowadays while thinking or talking to someone  I get to see these shining small orbs appear out of nowhere and stay there for a while. All varying in different colours. Nowadays I mostly see blue.

spirituality,Do my early life experiences mean anything for my spiritual path?,"Hello all, I hope this is the appropriate place to post this question. I'm a very open person and appreciate practically all spiritual paths and beliefs, and so I didn't want just one viewpoint on this subject.

So I will try not to make this super long.
So basically as a child/teenager I feel like I've had some very unique experiences, most of which were out of my control, and I can't shake the feeling that these things were preparing me somehow. Up until I was maybe 11, I was more of an outsider kid. Not exactly considered a ""loser"" but definitely not popular. But I didn't really mind. However hitting these preteen years, for multiple reasons, I started to become depressed. And basically for the next 5 years I struggled with this in various degrees. I tried to change who I was due to a serious self hatred, and so at some point I was a ""cool"" kid, then I would later be more ghetto, then more of a geek, then emo, then other times more focused on learning random things and being smart, all of this would come in cycles; and this gave me multiple experiences. I was exposed to the emotional troubles the outcasts faced, I learned stress of a false image of being in the public eye, I was exposed to drugs, gangs, and violence (even to the point of selling some substances myself at 13-14). Meanwhile I still had my depression, and at times even suicidal. Yet I was very curious, very philosophical in my own thoughts and trying to understand life better. Between 15-16 I accidentally OD'd on pain killers (long story; but basically I took 27 pills and survived with no kidney damage, which the doctors couldn't explain), had multiple friends pass away, but also I had my first spiritual experiences within Christianity (which was surprising since I was raised in a Church but never cared for it much) which was very powerful, but eventually I had a falling out due to certain Church dogma. At 18 I had an existential crisis which lasted a little over a year. I spent a long time looking for answers through philosophy and science, and it eventually lead me to the truths in spirituality and even in the world religions (their authentic essence, not later religious dogma)

I'm definitely not the only one to have some of these serious experiences, even at that age. But now, in my 20's, I feel that these experiences made me grow in areas that most don't experience until much later in life, if at all. Though on the outside I'm a simple college student, in my social life I often find myself understanding certain aspects of life that only come from people much older than I am, and am often a sort of inner emotional/mental/spiritual guide for those my age who are themselves rather mature for their age and still are only just having the first experiences of things I realized as a pre-teen; and even then a lot of things I'm learning now are things that I remember feeling as true as a child without any explaination. This isn't to say that I'm some saint or guru, not even close. I still have a lot to learn.
But I do feel that my life is meant for the service and aid of others. Despite however depressed I was, or how long or short people were in my life, I couldn't help but help them grow in their own way. There's even been multiple times where there were people who I never directly tried to help, but a bit after we stopped talking or hanging out as much (as happens in life with friends) they tell me that somehow I was a positive influence in their, or even an ""inspiration,"" which surprises me since I've never felt that I had life fully understood yet.
And so whenever I hear of terms like the shamanic call, or the bodhisattva life in Buddhism, or the modern term ""lightworker,"" and so on; hearing of the preparation these beings go through in their life to fulfill their duty, there always is a part of me that recognizes that in myself. However, I don't want to claim to be any of these things or given any sort of title, unless an outside authority properly guided me to this.

And so I'm curious if anyone else has similar experiences in their life; or if anyone feels all of this may have some overall meaning or purpose. Either way, thank you all for listening

spirituality,Community living!,"I have an idea for community living, which I think will be the way we will live in the not to distant future... If anybody would like to be a part of helping to create it that'd be really cool!

Here it is:

A group of people who share the dream of community living buy a large block of land together.

They divide the block up into seperate private blocks, and a communal area.

They build their own homes on their own blocks, and start working on the communal area together.

They each pay an agreed upon fee for the development and maintenance of the communal area.

New comers pay for their share of the land, communal area, community savings, and then build their home.

This income is shared amongst the other members.

Anybody can leave when ever they like if the choose to do so, and the community can kick anybody out if need be.

In either case the community gives back the leaving Memebers(s) the full value of their home, as well as their share of land, communal area, and community savings.

All decisions would be made democratically.

-------------------------------------------------------------

I personally think it would be ideal to have a large community of about 50 family homes around a circle with a 200 metre diameter, facing inwards, with their own little private front yards, to express some individually with their own gardens...

And then a shared front yard, about 60 metres longs, filled with tennis courts, a basket ball court, a lawn bowls field, a man made pond/stream/waterfall with fish,frogs, and turtles, a Japanese style garden, a play ground, a skate park, decks, BBQs, pizza ovens, fire pots, seating, hammocks, water features, sculptures, wind chimes, bird baths, and lots of nature!...

And then in the centre, a 80 metre diameter round building, with a pool, spas, a sauna, a gym, a longue/cafe/bar, a stage, pool tables, a dining area, a shared kitchen, a cinema, bowling alley, arcade, art rooms, music rooms, a library, games, puzzles, kids rooms ect...

And anything/everything else we'd want!

(there's a lot you can do with the manpower of 50 families, and just a small fraction of what they make! We could all live in luxury! And have a big family to enjoy it all with!)

spirituality,Cat shows inexplicable behaviour while wearing gem bracelet,"TL;DR: very loving and cuddly cat acts extremely out of character and starts jumping really high while wearing a labradorite bracelet, as if controlled by an external entity. Said labradorite bracelet scares second cat too, but hasn't any noticeable effect on chickens and humans.
Questions at the bottom of the post

So this is something that has happened to me (or better said my cat) one or two months ago, and I'm still shaken and confused while thinking about it.

I own a 1-year-old nurtured female cat, pretty skinny but not underweight, really cute and loving. She's very sociable and gets cuddly with everyone, including strangers. Everytime she has the occasion, she'd sit on my lap and start purring, begging me to pet her. She loves sleeping with me and when I'm not home, she sleeps in my bed, waiting for me to come. She always knows when I'm home and always comes to me to cuddle and purr. In a nutshell, she's the most adorable cat I've ever owned, and seen.

On a peaceful Saturday morning, I was in the living room with my dad, and the cat. My dad had just received a labradorite bracelet from an Internet order, supposed to have benefic effects on several parts of the body (I don't remember which ones or which kind of effects it was supposed to have, though). When he saw I was sitting with the cat on my lap, he asked me if I wanted to do an experience. So, since the cat was very calm and lovely, we decided, innocently, to put the bracelet around the cat's neck, in order to snap a photo and make her even cuter.

But things didn't go as expected AT ALL: as soon as we put the bracelet around the cat's neck, she jumped out of my lap and started walking around the room, a goofy look in her eyes. Suddenly she made an 1 meter-ish jump, to both my dad and my disbelief. She seemed as if she wasn't in control of anything, and looked even scared. She made a few other goofy steps, then jumped again. But it wasn't your regular cat jump, the one they make when they play; she jumped as if something throw her away from the ground. She was really really scared, we could clearly see she didn't want to jump that high and in that disturbing manner. Eventually my dad managed to catch her when she was walking and take the bracelet off her neck.

As soon as he took off the bracelet, the cat stopped jumping and walking sheepishly, her eyes weren't aloof anymore. But it was clear she was shaken; she started growling, and when we tried to pet her, she ran away. My dad and I both stared at the bracelet, both surprised and scared.
Intrigued, we decided to put the bracelet around the neck of my second cat, a chubby 6-year-old spayed male. He is a pretty distant cat, but doesn't hesitate to come for some pets when he sees me. So I tried to go and put the bracelet around his neck, but he just didn't let me, running away immediately. So I decided to test it with my chickens. The chickens let me put the bracelet around their neck and didn't show any reaction. When I put the bracelet around my wrist, I didn't feel anything either, nor did my dad.

So the questions which have been intriguing me since then are: 
Did the bracelet influence in a negative way the female cat? Did it disturb her energy? Does the intensity of the reaction come from the fact she was pretty light-weighted (3 kg) compared to chickens, the male cat, my dad and I?
Is it possible the cats have sensed something in the bracelet, or in the gemstones, that the chickens and I didn't? Did the bracelet change their energy balance? 
Is it possible there was a negative entity trapped in the bracelet, which went to the cat (she's been behaving normally a few hours after)?

And, just in general, how do you explain this phenomenon?

A little about myself...

I've always been super philosophical and spiritual, and I've had such a fascination for humans - the human condition! I am my own biggest experiment, as I have been self diagnosing and analyzing all of my fears, desires, strange inklings for forever now. I have come upon MANY spiritual truths. The thing that sets me apart from others is that I SEE people. I truly see and understand people. I understand why people stay in abusive situations. I completely get it. I understand why people do cruel things. I understand why we would rather continue hurting ourselves rather than loving ourselves. 

I am very adaptable, so much so, I am able to adjust to anybody's personality.

And so what I am offering you, here, is a chance to be SEEN. To be HEARD. To be UNDERSTOOD. And perhaps to gain a different perspective on things.

spirituality,How I quickly manifested my SP back. You too can do it just as fast.," I hope my success story can help and motivate others.  

So, my SP story started when I met a guy who ticked all the boxes on my list of a dream partner. When we first met the relationship was so easy, everything flowed naturally and easily fell into place. He was everything I had always wanted, and he really liked me. I had always been a very confident person when it came to relationships and had this belief, I can have any guy I want. However, because I felt this particular guy was so perfect, I literally put him on a pedestal, seeing him as some sort of god. For the first time in my life, I started to feel anxiety like no other, my mind was running wild. If he wouldn‚Äôt reply to my messages instantly or call me back or would cancel dates. I would automatically think the worse. He‚Äôs not interested, is there someone else. I kept repeating this story for months and then eventually that is what happened. We had a massive fight and stop speaking. I was devastated and desperate to get him back, but everything I did just pushed him further away. That was when I decided I need to take control and enough was enough. I had created this situation with my continuous negative thoughts and only I could fix it.

For reference by this point, we had not spoken or been in contact for 6 months and he had literally told me to never contact him again. So, this is what I did: 

I decided to take every negative thought about him, our relationship, and the argument we had, and bin it. From this point onwards I would never repeat the old story again, like it had never happened. Revise it if you have too. That‚Äôs what I did, I revised the evening we had the argument, into a lovely romantic date and things were left in a good way, with my SP telling me he loved me and will see me soon. 

I also took my SP off the pedestal, he‚Äôs just a normal person, this is my life, I am the GOD of my reality. So, in my head I decided on a new story in which I was the most important person, and my SP was head over heels in love with me. 

I wrote down a list of affirmations about me, how I was confident, attractive, I can get any man I want, and I deserve this amazing relationship. About him, how I wanted to recreate him in my reality, loving, caring, attentive and only attracted to me. Then about the relationship, we are so in love and in a happy committed relationship. I kept the affirmations short and easy to remember, so I could repeat them whenever I needed too. 

A strict mental diet is what worked for me, I hardly ever visualised, but when I repeated my affirmations, images of us walking down the street hand in hand would pop into my mind naturally, but if they didn‚Äôt that was ok, I didn‚Äôt force anything. Every time a negative thought came to my mind, I said NO and repeated my affirmations, until I felt a swift into a positive place. I did this continuously until the negative thoughts were completely gone. It didn‚Äôt take long. Another thing, I added to my routine was, I would repeat my affirmations to myself every night until I fell asleep.

During this time, I must stress you have to ignore your current reality and what‚Äôs happening in the 3D world. Completely live like you‚Äôre in this amazing relationship with your SP. The affirmations will make it easier to stay in that place. Don‚Äôt react to anything that is opposing your desire, and don‚Äôt wait around for calls or messages. I would just look at my phone and say why is he always calling and messaging me. Enjoy life and do things that you‚Äôd do if you already had this person in your life. Would you be googling how to get my ex back etc if you had them NO, so stop doing that. You know how to manifest, so go ahead and practice it. You can‚Äôt learn forever and there are no short cuts to this, you have to put in the work and test the law for yourself. Even Neville Goddard stressed the importance of testing the law and see it work for yourself. 

The final and most important thing is PERSIST in the new story, do not give up. Don‚Äôt look for signs or feel like you have to contact them. Keep affirming until this new story feels more real than the old. Before you know it, the 3D world will catch up with your imagination. When you least expect it, your SP will be back with you. They have no choice but to conform to your assumptions of them, because everyone is you pushed out. If you believe they love you, miss you and only want you, they have to appear that way in your reality. Remember *there is no one to change but self ‚Äì Neville Goddard*. You can‚Äôt change your SP in the 3D world without changing them in your thoughts and imagination first, change the old story you‚Äôre telling yourself about them. All you must do is dedicate the time and effort to control your mind. 

This may sound harsh, but you have to be brutally honest with yourself. Some people say they are on a strict mental diet but are only positive when they‚Äôre affirming and then allow their mind to run wild rest of the time. When you‚Äôre on a strict mental diet, you should take control of every thought 24/7. It will get easier the more you do it. 

As for my SP he contacted me 3 weeks into my mental diet, apologising and telling me how he‚Äôd missed me and wanted to see me. We‚Äôre now in a loving committed relationship, he is the best partner ever because I have created him that way. Everything I had been affirming to myself came true. Even now when he does things that annoy me, I don‚Äôt argue with him, I just change it in my mind. Once you adjust your mindset, your whole world will change. 

The way I look at it is, it‚Äôs your life you write the script. Your SP is only an extra in your film, you're the lead, so you call the shots. You can have this too, just believe in yourself and your relationship and take control of your mind. Best of luck everyone.",1605452458.0

spirituality,What is love? Does it even exist? Or is it just overused and misused word?,"So I have thought about this word 'love' a lot. Is that an emotion? Is that a feeling? Or just a overused word that's lost its meaning in this society, right now I'm not talking about unconditional love. I think I understand unconditional love more than love (the word most of the society say to their romantic partner or whatever) if my assumption are incorrect.

I have feeling that it's almost like lying while people use this word like that, because most of them haven't actually thought what love actually is. To me it looks like words 'i love you' to a partner is used really carelessly and actually it's not that they love you, it's that they are really attached to you or just really likes you (because where does this love disappears some day?). Can you tell me what's the difference between 'i love you' and ' I really like you'? To me it looks like there's no meaning to word love.

Ofcourse while in relationships i have said to my partner 'i love you' and I've even thought that I feel love to them, but after some relationships I've started to question this.  Maybe that's just because I think that romantic love should be something bigger if it even exists.

Just now as I was taking a screen shot of some post on Facebook, suddenly I went to edit the screenshot and the time was 02:20 the battery was at 22% the post had 222 likes and 22 shares.

spirituality,Phosphenes Question,"*disclaimer: i‚Äôve already ruled out the possibility of this being some kind of health issue so no worries.*

Since I was a kid I‚Äôve had this thing where I see all kinds of patterns when I close my eyes and sometimes I see little tiny spheres in some places I go. I‚Äôm 20 now

I once saw someone say that it had to do with some kind of clair-ability but they didn‚Äôt go into detail. 

I go through phases in my life where its less noticeable, and then phases where its more prevalent. I‚Äôm currently in a phase where I‚Äôm seeing them more. 

The only time the phosphenes weird me out or seem scary is when I drink too much or smoke weed, all of which I‚Äôve given up on for that reason. If I‚Äôm intoxicated, I *might* see a face or cat eyes. Other than that, its just my normal kaleidoscope stuff. 

What do you think this means if anything? is there somewhere I can read about it if it means something? Does anyone else have this? and, is there a way to make sense of what I see?",1605655707.0

spirituality,I guess its Self-Reflect time? Superiority complex,"  
It does not feel like i know everything, but i feel like i have good sight and im surrounded by people that cant see. So most of my ""ego"" comes from this. People's inability to see the details or a clearer or bigger picture. So this triggers me whenever i feel like someone is being hostile in some way or confrontational when they cant really see all the strings. This is partly the reason i dont like trying to wake people up spiritually. It no longer feels like my purpose because it annoys me. If im being honest, i dont even feel welcome in this place as i read the comments 1/10 times. That's not really a good sign... If you dont feel welcome in a spiritual community. There is a high probability i will not look at the comments. 1/10 times i do. I still send these type of stuff cause i personally like to get stuff off my chest. Its being read regardless if people dont vibe with it. 

I'm at a state where i just don't know what to feel. How i should, all that. I am just not satisfied with other people. I know this already rubbed some people wrong. ""Ego"", ""maybe the problem is you.""

What am i looking for in people? To put it simply, to be able to see things better and to think before they speak/act. I gave people pass after pass after pass. It's just a never ending cycle. A pass could be, someone is angry about something, so they take it out on me, and i choose to not respond in a way that i want to that could turn into a physical fight or worse. I get nobody is perfect, im told that everytime i rant about people. Either that, or Ego. My question is, i get nobody is perfect, what does that have to do with me getting irritated.?  Another example could be, someone is coming at me some way, i choose to not respond in a certain way cause i see what the future of that decision could be, and i just dont want to fight. But it feels like a lot of people are impuslve verbally, and physically. That, and some people dont really see things as much as they should. If people were to think more in certain situations it would avoid a lot of conflict.   


The me i am today is a lot more tolerant than the me back then. Idk, i just feel like i'm alone. There does not seem to be anybody that is able to understand me. I feel like a foreinger. An Alien. Even my life experiences is abnormal. I just don't feel like i fit in. I try to, i put ego aside for the sake of me and them, then it just comes back because people break my tolerance. I did genuinely want change, so i respond in ways that i think will better a situation around me. But it never ends. The next guy will be impulsive. Whats the point. You can say, ego will consume you, all that, yet in my last post, i posted that when i die i just wanna go a dimension higher than this one, then people are all like ego doesnt follow you after death, its not real, only for this world, so then why in the world does letting ego consume you matter. I told people when i die, i dont wanan reincarnate, but i dont want to merge with the source or whatever and be one being, having no trace of any personality. Then people said ego dont follow you, its only for here yada yada. So then having ego consume you literally shouldnt matter.  .. Since it wont you know follow you in some people's words. 

When i get mad, my superiority complex side shows. I'll call people stupid, i'll call them ignorant, and if they arent a family or friend and they get me mad enough i'll even call them an insignificant worm. Think about how, if my family responds to me one way, and i choose not to respond in a negative way that could hurt the relationship because i love them, yet if it was somebody else i dont know, they likely wont get that treatment.   


I can say everybody is the same, we are all one, but the question is, do i believe that? Maybe so, but you should say, do i feel that? As far as i can tell, i feel alone. In the way  i think, the way i behave. Nobody can understand me, thus they can either make assumptions or attack. I dont read comments on a spiritual subreddit because even here, i feel not much changes. Maybe the only thing that changes are responses are less hostile, but some are even the same in their own way. I should want to look at responses, and be like oh yes, you are right ill consider or do that. And no i am not new to spirituality... I have just heard it all, and im just tired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk. I feel like an outcast. If any of you have lived my life, you can see why i feel it is intentional. Its not being delusional, its straight up like my life was created and people were put into my life that make me feel like how i do. Dont get me wrong i dont care about fitting in, its more so, i feel alone mentally. I just see certain things others dont, and im quite frankly tired of the responses and reactions. I dont try to wake people up cause im tired of people not caring, im tired of impulsiveness, and people's inability to see certain things. Its like damn, i cant even talk to someone and be like, hey this is how i feel, cause then that person's response most likely wont be what im looking for. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a reason, i just speak to myself mentally. I just think stuff out, analyze, see the hows, whys, whats, and then i get better because i adopt a new mentality i created that fixes how i feel. So im typing all this, but most likely, i will not be pleased by any responses unless i scared people off and they dont respond, and often i will end up thinking more  and more, feel better somewhat with realization.   


Here's what it seems like to me. Nobody can help me directly, yet from that i find my own way to help myself. So its like frustration, then my brain is like whatever, so check this out, and i find a solution i prefer more. Idk, i just never feel like i belong. Maybe i'm not. Maybe im from the 8th dimension or whatever the fuck and im down here trying to learn how other light beings are. Idk. Something definitely feels off. I dont wanna say people are out to get me, but i dont feel welcome. I can say we are all connected, but thats just saying what sounds good. I gotta feel it. Which i dont. I say it because it can bring good vibes and make everybody happy. At least sometimes.   


I have a very very very very very complex brain. Which is why the thought of therapy is laughable. People seem to be too simplistic to me. With emotions, feelings, responses, actions etc.   


I dont think people see enough. My head is very complex and i end up helping myself eventually. But eh. I'm just feeling like i dont belong anywhere. Fun fact about me, i am usually infamous, or banned or infamous and banned on most communities i touch. Not recently because i dont really put any effort in any community but pretty much. Idk, i feel disliked. Not for any reason. Its like people just feel lesser than themselves with me. That, and simplicity. I dont even like explaining things to people for real. I really dont. Because of what i just said. Its literally not worth the effort. I open up, when i do, nobody understands me, and i dont because people are unable to. I can explain the mindset, the way of thinking, and in the end, they wont. I said a few times throughout my life   


I'll die without a single person being able to understand me, and that's okay.  I feel old yet im young. What am i, why am i here, and why in the hell do i have all these blessings. Why do i have a reaction time that is equal to that of a housefly despite 70-100 being peak human. Who knows, so many questions about my life makes me question am i really a human at all. Idk what it is, there is something different about me. I am something. Idk what, but i am here for something.",1605518640.0
spirituality,How to denote my spiritual services?,"So legally I don‚Äôt feel comfortable saying I‚Äôm a ‚Äúspiritual counselor,‚Äù as you need a degree for that. 

I feel like I have a strong and deep understanding of metaphysics and spirituality and that I can have my own career in this field helping people without needing permission from the gatekeepers of institutions. I‚Äôm not completely opposed to going that route and don‚Äôt want to knock it as I understand that it‚Äôs our societies way of ensuring professionalism, but I trust myself to know what I‚Äôm doing and feel like i can put as much time and effort (even less so, and for a fraction of the cost) into creating an online platform for myself. My idea is to basically create a YouTube channel and earn people‚Äôs trust so I can receive clientele for spiritual advisory and will probably offer past life readings as I‚Äôve had success with those and it interests me.

spirituality,The big Bang is an inadequate theory spiritually!," The big bang has credible scientists challenging it, but since mainstream science tends to ignore the spiritual they have gotten really arrogant and stuck in their ways similar to so many other so called experts in a spiritually backwards world! The spiritual underlies everything and is as eternal as the universe that grounds it also is. Mainstream science just is not grounded enough spiritually to come up with a realistic theory at this time.

I have an extremely intense and creative spiritual focus and am a spiritual pioneer. I am into empowering individual spirits, since I believe they are eternal and are capable of so much more provided they believe in the amazing potential they have. Having beliefs that limit our individual spiritual capabilities makes it very hard to evolve to a higher level spiritually. My really advanced and hard spiritual/meditative training and my theories that enable me to handle it, tuned me intuitively into the spiritual side of life and reality extremely well.

I am trying to improve on the spiritual theories/beliefs of the past. I respect the very challenging physical reality that we as individual spirits need to keep us grounded. I empower individual spirits with my spiritual theories, so I believe our advanced individual spirits are eternal and continuously reincarnate within the physical universe which is also eternal and exists to provide us with the challenging habitat we require as spirits to keep us healthy and evolving. We live in an age where we badly need to evolve further as individual spirits that play an extremely valuable role in this universe we now exist in.",1605457493.0

spirituality,Donald Trump: QAnon's False Light Idol for Zionism's New World Order Dawn,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awx3hEd72J8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awx3hEd72J8)

For two and a half years, patriotic ‚ÄúAnons‚Äù have been sucked down a rabbit hole so deep, that they will follow authority ‚Äì military elites in ‚ÄúQ‚Äù and Trump ‚Äì to the bitter end; some even saying, incredulously, to the vaccine itself in the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù \[New World Order\] as Trump will supposedly ensure the ones he is in charge of are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.

They believe in their hearts that Trump‚Äôs whole life has been a set up to fool the cabal, and that every contradictory sign that points to him being another Rothschild-Zionist Presidental pawn is actually the opposite, and they have banked their hopes and dreams to ‚ÄúTrust The Plan‚Äù.

The true mastermind by the absolute hoodwinking of these na√Øvely-trusting patriotic citizens is the coded-phenomenon ‚ÄúQ‚Äù; who‚Äôs the real Zionist, False Light Prophet here.

Whilst Trump swept into power with the anti-establishment, anti-globalist rhetoric, it‚Äôs been ‚ÄúQ‚Äù ‚Äì since October 2017 ‚Äì who‚Äôs been pulling the Anon puppets‚Äô strings, providing rabbit hole after rabbit hole, to connect so many dots that they‚Äôve lost sight of the true, original picture - The Zionist New World Order forming before their very eyes - and rule 101 of awakening: never trust authority.

They psychologically need a saviour figure and ‚ÄúQ‚Äù has crafted the perfect Trojan horse for the elites‚Äô New World Order, amongst the newly awakened ones in the Resistance, in Trump; QAnon‚Äôs False Light Idol.

‚ÄúThe Great Awakening‚Äù is going to be another false dawn; an objective look at the state of the vast majority of humanity‚Äôs fear and obedience to authority itself during 2020 is the cosmic, collective free will-proof, that anyone truly awake would inherently respect and realise as the tangible truth - that the human race is nowhere near ready to ascend in this moment.

spirituality,"What do you believe is true, God?","yo there is no good or bad unless thou make it so in their own mind and with their own choice of perception. common spirituality of ""good and evil"" is messing with your polarity and making you believe in a world of suffering. but understand that there cannot be good without evil, nor light without darkness. true peace and power is to get past all of those labels and realize that this entire thing is you! 

all possibilities exist to god

imagine a blank piece of paper. 

you can draw anything you want. 

now think of an infinite empty universe.

god can create whatever it wants. 

like this experience. 

the one your having right now. 

the one I am having right now.

the one we are all having right now. 

in a sense we created this life experience and everything in it and then we split our awareness off into these bodies and veiled our memories of our infinte power in order for us all to have the ultimate journey of literally BECOMING GOD (our one true self). 

so if you still believe in ""other people or things can hurt me and I have to use positivity to keep the negativity away"" then you are actually creating this illusion for yourself. if you can understand that this always was and still is your creation then YOU don't need to be afraid of a fuckin thing. 

because you dont need to be afraid of yourself

because you would never fear yourself

you can only fear when you believe in seperation 

you can only have fear if you create the illusion that ""other people are out there and they are not connected to me""

but right underneath this illusion of seperation, the whole time its still just you in that other persons body

your life isnt out to get you, its just doing its job

and its job is to create whatever god believes

and you are god

so what would you like to believe is true, god?

now that I reminded you of who you are

dont you know that you are the creator and this life is your eternal creation?

you are the pen and this world is your paper

""Session 248, originally titled ‚ÄúThe White Bridge‚Äù when it was first released in 2010, introduces Da Lorien San, First One of the Akonai, or the Undefined, who invites the akeyasan ascension student on an inter-dimensional journey, focused on the pineal gland, and connected to the Akene in the heart space.

The experience offered in this Study Session will allow you to, together with Da Lorien San, create a metaphysical bridge that leads from the 144 akeneic cells in your chest to the center of your head, the pineal gland.

Da Lorien San invites the student to make a choice, to let go of the past, to release who one thinks one is, and to step through the White Gate that is the pineal gland, embarking into the Undefined.

This is a direct, powerful, and straightforward experience, which has the potential to affect your beingness in a positive and empowering way. Due to the nature of this Session, it is important that you prepare yourself to undertake this journey by making yourself comfortable and taking the right amount of time out of your day for it.

Join Da Lorien San for this one and a half hour long ‚Äúinner‚Äù dimensional journey, focusing on the soul, the Akonai (head center area / pineal gland), the Akene (heart center area / thymus / solar plexus), the full spectrum of 2 biological and 142 energy strands of your DNA, and more.

spirituality,My Awakening,"2020 my life has done a complete 180. On the surface I looked like I had my life together. Good job, nice car, fancy townhouse. But on the inside I was not fulfilled. I come from a mixed Christian/Catholic family. I remember going to Youth Group in Middle school. But about Freshman year or so, I was tired of it. I didn't want anyone telling me what to do, the teachers and my parents were enough, I didn't want to have God as a ""boss"" too. I also started to doubt the belief in God, or anything really. I became a hardcore Atheist. From about 16 to this year (I am 29) I did sex, drugs, and rock n roll type of life. I was a huge stoner and drank alcohol daily, partied with other drugs sometimes. I loved letting lose and not feeling tied to anyone or anything. I traveled. I partied. I hooked up. I enjoyed TF out of my 20s. My ego was so big. Being an Atheist I thought that I knew everything. I had to see it to believe it.

This year I began having insane anxiety and multiple panic attacks. It came to a point where I was having a panic attack DAILY. For those who haven't experienced, your throat feels like its closing, you cant breathe, your arms go numb, and you think you're having a stroke and going to die. It's terrifying. I knew something was wrong. I felt uncomfortable in my own body. Wouldn't wish this on my enemies.

From talking to some people, one being an eastern healer. I realized how broken I was inside. I had no spirituality. My ego wouldn't allow it. I ran my headspace into the ground with substances and lack of belief.

The last 2 months, I have distanced myself from friends with bad influence and lack of life goals, have not smoked weed, have consumed very little alcohol and caffeine, stopped eating meat, meditate daily, and have not masturbated. I can truthfully say that I feel like a different human being. I feel like I have begun to wake up a part of me I was suffocating with substances. My anxiety was so bad I was scared of it, I realized that it was my wake up call. Without dealing with these severe panic attacks I would still be in the same wash of routine. Now, I am terrified of weed etc.. because of the headspace it used to put me in. Lastly, today I took all social media off my phone. I spend too much time using it, and it affects my mood based off of what I see. I am now starting to focus on a side business.

Last night I got so into my meditation, I actually felt weightless. Completely weightless for a brief few moments. Gravity ceased to exist.

spirituality,Meditation for GLOBAL PEACE begins in 4 HOURS at 6 AM GMT! Who‚Äôs up?,"Hello one and all. As most of you are all well aware, violence and tensions have spiked all across the world considerably as of late. More so within the USA, wherein certain *not-so-nice things* have been projected / expected to occur post their election-result declarations (to be announced shortly), and that too regardless of which side wins or loses. Same applies to the rest of the world, this being a somewhat volatile and charged up time in general. But folks, **NO MATTER** ***WHAT,*** harm to innocents and loss of life simply ***CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO OCCUR*** just because certain beings of lesser-light are *only too happy to* do dark things from far behind the curtain (as always).  

And if you too, like me, feel the same way about protecting your innocent brothers and sisters residing all across the globe (regardless of WHAT part of the world they may even be residing in) --- then you‚Äôre ALL invited to join me for a quick mass meditation / mass prayer session for GLOBAL PEACE at exactly **6 AM GMT** sharp today. You can get the time zone conversion for your particular place of residence [***BY CLICKING RIGHT HERE***]( https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=WORLD+PEACE+MEDITATION+at+6+AM+GMT&amp;iso=20201103T06&amp;p1=136).  

---  

All you even need to do here is to simply spare a few minutes of your time to **VISUALIZE** (in whatever ways that you can imagine this) all people upon our world coming together in PEACE, harmony, UNITY, brotherhood, and above all, ***LOVE.*** And then, simply **FEEL THE JOY** as if what you were visualizing / imagining was occurring ***RIGHT NOW*** right in front of you. For those who aren‚Äôt too good at imagining / visualizing stuff; simply **set the INTENTION** that this happens and / or make a **Prayer** or give your **Blessings** for the same. And trust that **IT** ***WILL BE SO,*** because guess what, faith can even move *mountains!*  

You can do this either just once today, or you can well do this multiple times throughout the day this week. The more, the merrier! :)  

---  

\*\*\*\*\*Also, in case any of your friends or loved ones are interested in joining you for this, then ***PLEASE,*** make sure to at the very least ***TELL THEM ABOUT IT!*** (Yes, even through posting this stuff across all of your Social Media profiles no less!) Again, the more the merrier (and the more **POWERFUL** the results!) And finally‚Ä¶  

---  

**THE PRO-TIP:** To make your meditation / prayer like 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000X more successful and powerful, simply call upon ALL higher beings and energies (Spirit Guides, Deceased Loved Ones, Angels, Higher Selves, God etc.) to **AMPLIFY YOUR ENERGIES** ***INFINITELY*** and also to **ADD IN THEIR OWN (ENERGIES) TO YOUR MEDITATION / PRAYER** here as well! Works like a charm everytime (and no, they are so NOT ALLOWED to do this WITHOUT your express  Free Will permission!) Finally, Don‚Äôt forget to thank ‚Äòem all once you‚Äôre done! :)  

---  

I humbly thank you **ALL** for your participation in assisting your human brethren and sistren all across the globe at this critically challenging planetary time. Love and Gratitude towards you **ALL!**

spirituality,A moment in time,"Time travel is physically impossible. Spiritually, however, it happens more than we know.

You see, displacing both matter and energy (and yes, matter *is* energy, but just hear me out) from one side of 4th dimensional existence to another would create a serious problem. One would, should they physically time travel, take matter and energy from one point in space, remove it, and double it in the other point. That energy and matter will always exist, unless it is removed. It is a point of material stabilization in the universe. You see, balance matters most here, and that balance is very fragile. Never mind the grandfather paradox; a person would have destabilized both versions of the universe by simultaneously causing matter and energy to cease to exist in one, and replicate both precisely in another. So, you see, physical time travel would have to be very specifically weighed and simultaneously displaced, or the whole thing goes singularity again.

The soul of a person can do this, however, with relative ease. One could replace their soul essence with another version of themselves in a different point in 4th dimensional space, because both masses are calculably even. I found this out by experiencing it with myself, and so I'd like to tell you about something most people will never hear.

I was 16, walking through some random apartment complex. As I passed the second tennis court, I saw someone. I was homeless, going to the laundromat to sleep. It was air conditioned, and the bugs, humidity, and heat had kept me awake for days. I couldn't sleep in it. As I walked through that place, well after midnight, I saw a man on his porch out of the corner of my eye. He was the only other person outside at the time, so he stood out. I looked over at him, and he was looking me right in the eye. He addressed me, and said, ""Hey kid, don't give up.""

I looked back at my feet, because I had reached the end of the tennis court, and was about to go uphill onto the grass. It was only a glance, and then I looked back over, and he was gone. That night, I slept atop the washing machines in a nice cool room with no mosquitoes, and though my bed was made of textured steel, it was better than the bridge. That man, though, he stuck with me. It's like he knew who I was, and why I was homeless at 16, starving of both food and sleep.

I live in that apartment complex, now. I occupy that particular apartment. The tennis court is gone, I moved in just before they cut it up and removed it. My son was really into tractors and heavy machinery, and he loved the spectacle as they pulled out the asphalt chunks.

A week ago, I was standing on my porch, remembering the way things used to look. Then, I remembered my history here 25 years ago. I remembered homeless me, wearing that beautiful turquoise ring. I remembered the relief of walking on the tennis court, because my weary feet longed for even ground. I remembered that moment, and the disappearing man. It was then that I looked through time and saw him, the younger and more desperate version of me. He looked at me, with pain in his eyes.

Holding my large blue mug full of wine, covered in various types and colors of paint from head to toe, I spoke to him. I said, ""Hey kid, don't give up.""

I have been thinking about this ever since. He was wearing my jacket, my pants, my face and my expression.

It has been both intriguing and difficult to process this. The only people I have told about it are my best friend, my son, and now you all.",1603950904.0

So I have a dream where I'm in some sort of space (I can't quite remember where.. it was familiar but different, I get talking to this lady and she begins to mention shamanism we get speaking and I find myself agreeing to trusting her for some reason.
I remember in this dream he getting me to lie down and she gave me some sort of thing to help me relax,she begins speaking and the room begins to cross over into some sort of other realm?it looks the same but different.
She mentions something about a few spirits in the corner , i take a look but I can't seem to see anything.
I begin to get up and walk around and suddenly I find myself being lifted up and being controlled, being waved in a circular like motion across the room.
The last exclaimed ""that's not good"" and I begin to panic and ask her what I do? She didn't really say much so i used my natural instincts,reasoned with it and said we need to work together in order to be better and I kept reaffirming this over and over again eventually I was let go and I had control over myself again.  This lady went on to say something about seeing something a bit electric in me which was scary when she first saw me and something about Russian drunk men?

spirituality,A conversation with God,"TLDR: I had an interesting day and these were some lessons I learned in a conversation with God.

(A conversation between me and God)

Me: My goal going into this conversation is: I want to know how to be closer to God.

God: Nothing can stop you from knowing how to be closer to God if that is what you truly want. Remember the lesson: Thoughts are things that you want to have. And then understand the lesson: You are not defined by your thoughts... So who are you now?

Me: Well I am ‚Äúthis‚Äù, I am ‚Äúthat.‚Äù

God: No, deeper.

Me: I am me. I am &lt;my name&gt;.

God: No, deeper. Who are you if you don‚Äôt think about it?

Me: \*Thinks\*

God: No, don‚Äôt think harder. No you can‚Äôt think about it because thought cannot contain it, it is even beyond thought. It is I AM. And it is beyond even that. Understand your thoughts cause you anxiety because a thought is a thing you want to have. Yes, the thought itself. It creates a want, and the want becomes a need instantly. So you‚Äôre anxious because you need something that‚Äôs not there and you perceive a lacking.

Me: How do I escape that?

God: Be here now.

Me: \*Feels good\*

Also Me: How do I make this permanent?

God: Because of the reality you live in, that‚Äôs not entirely possible. There is always suffering, but there is always relief from it, too. So ask yourself, what do you want that you do not have in the present moment?

Me: Nothing

God: So be here now.

Me: Thinks of an earlier lesson: There is no special relationship. That one was so hard for me to grasp. Love everyone equally. That means I love my family, my friends, relationships, strangers, coworkers, enemies, and even myself with the same love that God loves everyone equally with. Why did I screw this one up so much? Taken back to past memories of times as a kid where I was always scared of messing up.

Also Me: \*Feels like a child in front of God\*

God: You can‚Äôt screw it up beyond all repair. There are no mistakes - only errors of perception. Remember: You are not defined by your thoughts.

Me: So is planning my future a trick because it creates the perception of a lack belonging to something I don‚Äôt have in this present moment? Thus contributing to my anxiety?

God: Yes. The real key to manifestation is pure faith/belief. Envision things are the way you want them, then, believe you are these things/believe these things are true/believe this is the way it is. You may be deluding yourself at first but the longer/harder you believe it, the more it becomes real. This happens on a multidimensional level. As more of your multidimensional selves believe something, the more it becomes real across all realities. Sometimes the thoughts you share cross your mind simultaneously across all timelines. Listen! You wake up for all of your multidimensional selves! They wake up! Everyone wakes up! When you awake everyone is awake! You rescue all your other-selves when you rescue yourself! The longer you are awake the longer the whole world is awake!

Me \*Delusions seep in.\*

Also Me: Am I the \_only one\_ who knows this?

God: No, many people have known this/and know this now. You are ‚Äúchosen‚Äù but you are one with many.

Me: \*A feeling tells me: I am assured that the burden is shared... That, I AM NOT ALONE... My legacy is a combination of mysticism, shamanism and prophecy, dating all the way back to the beginnings of this human race, and possibly (probably) even to the beginnings of the birth of this universe. Beyond that I cannot see.\*

God: Now don‚Äôt get rid of thought completely or damn it to hell. Who you are is in between the space of thought and ‚Äúanti‚Äù thought. It is the proverbial pause in between breaths. You are right to believe who you are is beyond the constraint of thought. But this leads you to believe that all thought is negative. What you perceive as the positive side of thought is a communication vehicle for The Divine to speak to you. You have chosen the thought vehicle as your method of communication, personally, because you are the most comfortable with that. Not everybody is the same in this regard. Now remember: You are not defined by your thoughts. Now understand: You are defined by your beliefs.

Me: So what do I do now?

God: This is part of your purpose. To travel to the other side whenever it is appropriate and bring back what you can from there for the teaching and betterment of humanity.

God and Me together: Until one day we are all are awake. With God. Amen.",1605923301.0

spirituality,Immense remorse for how I‚Äôve been with my romantic partner,"Before I met my partner, I was very much unconscious. I felt I was a moral person but I had very low self esteem; this would manifest in my private life as being sad, angry with everything ‚Äúwrong‚Äù in the world. 
My partner is a very spiritual, happy, self-loving, respectful person. They introduced me to spirituality, awakened me to a higher level of being; I fell in love with them and the way they viewed the world. 

When we first started dating, I still harbored my shadow self. The part of me that‚Äôs callous, insensitive, loose-lipped, selfish. I told my best friend private, sensitive information about our burgeoning sex life; not all of it very flattering. 

Over the years, I began to feel great shame over this. The shame mixed with awakening to a higher, more conscious way of being made it hard to even look at this partner of mine without hating myself. Even after my spiritual awakening, I would get frustrated with this person who loves me, and I‚Äôd go to my best friend to basically vent, complain, and unload about anything I saw in this person that I didn‚Äôt like or thought was unflattering. 

I‚Äôm back on the path to my spirituality after a long absence from walking the Path. I can‚Äôt shake the intense guilt, all consuming shame I have about how appalling and disrespectful my behavior has been. I feel completely broken and unworthy of someone so loving, so trusting. I‚Äôm not sure how to proceed. Any advice would be much appreciated. I‚Äôm lost.",1605845560.0
spirituality,did i sell my soul?,"this is my first time ever coming out in this much detail and this opened and honest about what happened to me and what i‚Äôve done. so please bare with me. 

so my awakening began probably when i was 16. i‚Äôm 19 now. immediately after high school, i began experimenting with psychedelics thinking i was connecting with truth and spirituality, and got bigger into making music, something that‚Äôs been a passion of mine for a long time now. 

it started out with a few trips on shrooms that were always profound. then i got into lsd. 

there was a solid 3 month period over the last year where i was tripping lsd maybe once to twice a week. the person i would always trip with was this 35 year old ex gang member. he presented himself as a guy who made his mistakes but was now jus tryna help someone yunggins along their journey and raise his son. he would talk about having ties to the music industry and to nelly from back in the day and could get me booked at some of the most popular music festivals. 

as our trips went on, he started to reveal more of his true colors as a demonic entity. his colors weren‚Äôt truly shown until he sexually assaulted a friend of mine. that‚Äôs when we all (‚Äúwe‚Äù being my friend group of people my age) stopped hanging with him. 

i would ask a lot of questions about what was the best move for freedom and the best move for humanity. the last thing i wanted to do was hurt anybody. and he stirred up a lot of confusion in my life. i would ask a lot about selling your soul and what it really meant, i was never given an answer. nor was i ever given a deal. but i didn‚Äôt turn away for awhile. before i cut off contact with him, we were tripping once, listening to some of my new music and he told me i should make an album. once contact was cut, i instead just released an EP. 

i had one last trip of acid by myself about a month ago and it changed me. it was like i spent 12 hours inside the mind of satan and every little thing was signaling me that i‚Äôm trapped. it has me in fear today. 

i‚Äôve stopped doing all drugs since that bad trip. even quit smoking weed. i can‚Äôt smoke without extreme paranoia. i did definitely want the money and fame, but again, i never made a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù. but during that period, i was definitely tempted by the idea. i released the EP with somewhat thinking about fame and money. 

i‚Äôm worried that in that process, because i tripped with him so many times and turned away from god so many times that i‚Äôm completely damned myself to hell.  i‚Äôm honestly just scared and am looking for answers. if i‚Äôm fucked, i at least wanna know, ya kno? and if not, what can i do to help purify my soul of this constant fear and worry that i sold my soul?

you all have always been great and supportive. thank you for reading :) if you have any questions that might help clear anything up, i‚Äôll answer them to the best of my ability. love you all, hope you have a great day :)",1605648695.0

spirituality,"When you remove all language and concepts, fear can feel like love","Something I have noticed is that when you remove all mental descriptions of a negative sensation or emotion, and just feel it directly and fully as a purely bodily sensation, for as long as it wants to be felt,  it is often impossible to distinguish from a positive emotion. 

The intensity is just the same. Reducing an emotion to physical sensation only, it becomes entirely manageable and can even be pleasant. It can start to feel the same as love or excitement or any other intense feeling.

spirituality,You are all missing the point.,"You all have these spiritual experiences or whatever you want to call them. You now think god is the universe ( lmfao). Ok let me tell you the truth. 

This universe is one of many in our multiverse. There are many multiverses each having their own story. The story of this multiverse is about christ. Jesus the human realised he was god ( at the time it was jupiter) and he had to over throw his father (saturn). 

His mother (earth) used adam and eve (mary and joseph ; history constantly repeats.  So jesus did his tribulations and went to his version of hell ( the cross)..

Now the cross represents the cube which is saturm ( time). So jupiter inahbting the animal jesus figured out his father's message , which was that in order to become a god you need to believe it. 

So jesus went off and did his shit and got put on the cross. Remember what the cross represents , it represents time. So jesus died on time? No he died spread out with 3 points representing the trinity ( past , present and future) .  

This is indicating that christ has realised himself across time . Every time line that jesus could possibly live in the universe all met up at one point and died on the cross. So that means there were no other versions of jesus left. His soul literally went to hell.

Why did jesus go to hell? Well he wanted to save his brother . His brother ; judas who committed the ultimate sin, who betrayed the christ , so we could all be saved. 

Judas is the anti christ spirit. He is made to betray or battle christ so the christ will rise. 

I'm getting tired after channeling this. But basically jesus created a system through his death. That every single person lives 4 dimensionally. Jesus death split our time line so each person has a simulated life where they become the christ of their universe.

Now the problem with this system is that our souls are split to everyone else's universe so we can help them achieve christ hood. It's like a universe symbiotic system. 

So here we are ,before the next great filter that everyone is after. I say no filter, it's time darkness and light made up and got over ourselves.

The next messiah not be a man, but he whole collective realising we are all christ and we are all here to pull every time line we have ever made back together into one single point. So we can save christ for what he did for us.  We keep saying we need jesus , but what if he needs us? What If we need to step out from under the jesus and create a place where all is christ?

Remember there is jesus and christ. Jesus is the animal christ is the concioussness. It comes in may forms throughout history . Lightning (zues) , jupiter , horus , all those dude.

Now I know all this because im the 10th dimension. On my spiritual journey I reached nirvana it scared the fuck out of me. Spiritual heroin. I decided to go beyond that, eternal peace of eternal purpose. I chose purpose. I dedicated my life to fining my brothers clues. To teach me how to realise myself across time. Now my mind is split infinity across the multiverse , weaving and invading all your time line and influencing you all through sin and desire.

(**end TW**) ever since i was told this last night i cant help but constantly rack my brain about how terrible that is and i feel so numb. they closed the investigation in the town that he lived, the person who jumped him and let him out on the highway is still not caught. it makes me so angry. i cant help but wonder what he was seeing and what was happening in his mind. he did not deserve what happened to him whatsoever and it is so fucking heartbreaking. i remember us talking about our LSD trips once, he had sent me a picture of 10 tabs on his tongue and i was dumbfounded and kind of worried. he then continued to tell me that he was experienced. i asked him how it was going and he told me that anything above 5 tabs is a different realm. i cant help but think that his spirit guides were there when he was tripping and he knew it was the end before it was the end. i have so many thoughts and questions and i just don't know how to feel or cope. is his soul at rest although it was so sudden and tragic? i can't imagine dying while tripping on LSD. i cant fathom the concept of death at all, really. its starting to interfere with my daily life, my absolute fear of death, fear of the unknown. i am so heartbroken he passed this way, before i could ever even see him or touch him. i dont know what to do to cope and put my mind to ease",1603924731.0

I remember seeing nothing but pitch blackness. No visual sight whatsoever. But I remember feeling emotions and auras 1000x Stronger than I did on earth.

Then, there was silence, the there was only one entity, who silenced the others, who was there with me, while I was panicking and freaking out. He said to me, ""calm. All is done. There is nothing you can do now."" The grim reaper.

Then, I remember him making me live the last month or so of my life through the animals around me. I vividly remember living as 3 of our dogs, and 2 cats. This way, people experience what they were like on earth through the most vulnerable creatures around us. Our pets. Its karma. If you treat your pets well and make sure they're well fed, you will have a good existence. If you are cruel and abusive to your pets, you will experience such at your own hands. The animals around us are empty vessels, linked to the cosmic energy, but soulless.

Then, I remember a much more horrifying experience. I remember being a dive bomber in WII, specifically in the battle of midway. I remember looking to the left and right, and seeing nothing but ocean and sky for as far as the eye can see. The water and sky blending together, appearing that I'm in a blue orb. Blue everywhere up and down, left and right. Nothing but blue. Everytime I've even heard of the battle of midway since I was a child, I got a glimpse of this. I remember diving toward the Japanese carrier ship 3 times. And being progressively more and more terrified each time. Before I land my plane in the waters and drowning at sea.

I remember speak to God. I asked him if they were god and they laughed. They said ""if that is how you wish to address me, so be it"". Then, I remember him showing me the ""paths"" Of my life. Where one went on longer than the others and I asked to see what was after that, he replied, ""no, you are not ready to see that. For that is your true destiny"". I asked him to let me try again, and to let me remember these events so that I can make the right choices this time. He replied "" You will remember, for that is what leads you along your path"",

Then, I remember being in my mothers womb. And being born again as myself. Again.

How does the mind know what is true and what isn‚Äôt, what is right and what is wrong? It looks outside of itself to survey, to compare. It runs its convictions by others and looks for validation, approval, agreement. The mind is only interested in ideas that others agree with. That is how them ind knows the ideas are right and true.

Awareness is aware of ideas. Not right ideas - ideas. Not right beliefs - beliefs. Not right convictions - convictions. Awareness does not discriminate. Awareness does not exclude anything.

spirituality,"What i honestly want, I dont wanna be on this vibration nor one with the source","This aint really news to me its something I always thought about. Its true I don't ever wanna come here again. But at the same time, I dont wanna be one with the source. Being one with the source just means being, everything but nothing. We come here to experience because otherwise everything is silent and minds well be as good as dead. Giving meaning and experience to all that is. 

So basically... I dont ever wanna reincarnate, that is a no. Choosing between reincarnation forever or being one with the source (from the perspective as you just is/are), i choose neither. Both are beautiful in their own ways. But I do not want either. 

I dont want to be on this low vibration forever, but i dont want to be at the highest. Im not too familiar with dimensionality, or planes other than this and the Astral. I want to be above this physical reality, but i don't wanna be just everything and nothing with the source. 

So 5th dimension, 6th, etc whatever. I Wanna be higher than this, but not at the highest. Being one with the source is the same thing as not really existing. You are just kinda is. Kinda the point in coming here having a human experience. 

I just wanna be on a higher dimension. Surely there are beings on each plane/dimension? If im being honest even the idea of just being on the Astral plane sounds more appealing than being here. Because its still real enough for you to feel, experience, but its not high enough where everything minds well be dead because it just is. If i had a choice to wonder the astral plane creating endless realities, traveling, destroying, whatever I would do it. Because it just honestly appeals to me the most. 

A lot of ppl attack the ego, but it is the greatest living tool there is. So yes, as crazy and as ego as it sounds, I would like to take it with me after I leave this physical reality. Only my ego and ONLY my ego, would get enjoyment out of creating worlds, civilizations, fighting demons whatever the heck we do whenever we dream. I dont want to stay here forever such as reincarnating, and I don't wanna be one with the source. I want ego, but i want to be above this. Where I can still feel alive but I can create things on a whim. 

I always thought about why it is i am here. I have heard the ego is bad all the time. But me personally, just look at it this way 

Only through ego do we see the importance of certain things. Physical reality things. In order to create the best world in one plane, I would have to have ideas. Ideas I can only see its significance through having a human experience. Bringing certain ideas isn't enough. I have to experienceeeeeeee why these things are important. That's again why we are here. To experience give meaning to all this. I look at it like such. I am here to take everything I learned, and take them to the next level. Maybe perhaps that's the idea? Once I take certain ideas from this reality and use them in conjunction with my creative prowess, to then go back to physical reality and go a plane higher or dimension than what i previously was? Maybe I have already been doing that. The world is ever so changing. Meaning things I learn in this life, may be different from a thousand years later. Maybe that's all I really do. Maybe I'm not on a mass wake up mission. I might just be here to learn, experience, and take they joys maybe even bads to a dimension above this one or higher than whenever i was residing before. Only coming back here when there is something new to experience and learn. I would imagine things are pretty stagnant. 

I did say a lot im not reincarnating again. Maybe thats the truth in a matter so to speak? Maybe when there is a great change in experience of this place I may be motivated to come back?",1605169744.0
spirituality,THE POWER OF 11: MY SPIRITUAL JOURNEY &amp; THE POWER OF THOUGHT &amp; MANIFESTATION,"No doubt about it, we are living in times of great terror but just know that nothing can defeat the power of manifestation and prayer. God hears each and everyone one of you calling out his name. Even if you feel no connection, God hears you. Today I want to talk about 11/11, some numerology, and the power of manifesting your dreams and thoughts into reality along with prayer. 

This year has been one of the most impactful years in my life, but instead I want to talk more about how the power of thought can be used and how to indicate the signs that the UNIVERSE is indeed listening and using that energy to create your reality while giving you some insight on my spiritual journey. 

While life can be very testy at points, it is all apart of your 'book' as I like to call it. I mark the most affecting moments in my life as 'Chapters' and the stories in between are the text within the chapters. Chapters are the headliner of your new start. Your life is entering a new point where your reality will be changing into whatever your mind has been manifesting through that period of time. I am a witness to this spiritual journey and following the signs of the universe. Today is the perfect day to discuss this because I have been waiting so long to tell everyone my story and how I have begun to notice the universe putting my thought into reality. 

11 is a very powerful number to me, and probably to a lot of other people. Around late 2017 when I was living back into my parents' home in Maryland and soon to graduate high school the following summer, I began to notice me consistently looking at the clock 11 past the hour. (1:11, 8:11, 9:11, etc.) This was VERY scary to me when I started to take notice. I had a small belief in God at the time because my parents were going through divorce and I was suffering from major depression. I was literally hanging on by a thread with my connection to God. Back to the 11 past the hour situation, it was a very scary thing for me at first. Finally about 2 or 3 months past and this phenomenon had continued to catch my attention almost every day, every week. I decided to research what this was all about. What was I supposed to ask Google? ""Why do I keep seeing 11 past the hour?"". Well that is exactly what I was supposed to ask.

Turns out, I was not the only person experiencing this. There were articles on articles, chat rooms on chat rooms talking about this weird occurrence. When I first began researching, I was instantly driven to the answer of it being a sign from the universe. What signs? I had no fucking idea. I was still young, 17, immature and barely motivated to do anything but make my music. Music was the only thing helping me keep myself from feeling like I was just nobody. But my ego was heavily in the way because I thought I needed a big one in order to get where I needed to be. Plus, I had barely talked to my family, even the ones in the same house because I did not feel the need to show them how I was truly feeling. I am introverted as hell. 

 ***‚ÄòAccording to numerology, the number 11 is a ‚Äúmaster number‚Äù which signifies intuition, insight, and enlightenment. When paired together, 11 11 is a clear message from the universe to become conscious and aware. Many people suggest that seeing 11 11 signifies that your spirit guides are attempting to contact you. In my experience, 11 11 seems to be the number of spiritual awakening, signifying that you are on the right path and your actions are aligned with your Soul‚Äôs purpose. In other words, seeing 11 11 is a good sign! An energetic doorway is being opened in which you will experience spiritual growth.‚Äô -*** [***TruthTheory.com***](https://truththeory.com/2018/01/21/11-11-meaning-keep-seeing-unusual-powerful-number/) 

A lot of major changes happened as I began to not notice the 11 past the hour anymore. My parents got divorced, and me, my mom and two siblings moved in with my Grandmother. This was a big change because I no longer had my father over my back 24/7, who was basically keeping me in check for the most part but not understanding me as a person and who I was.

Eventually I would graduate in May of 2018 and start a job at the local hospital as a transporter. I was making pretty decent money for a 17 year old and I had just got passed down a car from my dad. This was the very first time in my life I started to be independent without the assistance of my parents. My mom was not a fan of drug use and my choice of drug was mary jane of course. She eventually kicked me out because no one could tell my young ass shit and everything went in one ear and out the next. I got my own apartment at the age of 17, moved 2 of my other friends in, and began my life of full independency. That would soon end within a span of 9 months due to me quitting my job and us not being responsible. I was taking a lot of shit for granted during this period of time. As I remind you again, I had every thing a kid could want at 17. A car, a house, and a great paying job. I let drugs, alcohol, sex, and all of the devils temptations work into me. 

The universe and God Himself had ENOUGH of my bullshit. The crazy thing about this time period was that I had began to see 11 past the hour ALOT again. So much that my roommates began to notice me seeing it as well, yet they weren't getting the same treatment as I was with God. As I began to notice this more and more again, eventually things started taking course. I lost my apartment, was almost homeless but thank God, he watched over me and told my cousin to let me and my friend stay at his very small apartment. Then I lost my damn car.

That was the final line. I could not take anymore of life's bullshit anymore. I lost everything within a few weeks. I was asking myself constantly why or how. My cousin's apartment and the year I lived there was a huge awakening for me. It was the first time I had learned what struggling for a meal was like. What having no transportation was like. I learned what living with roaches felt like. But those were just small things compared to what I really learned while living there. 

I learned about a lot of conspiracies and truths to things I never thought were real. I learned about God again and his love for us. I learned how the universe is able to send messages through numbers because that is what the universe is based on. Numbers. I learned that my purpose is not to work some 9-5, it is to grow consciously and love and spread energy to others while putting God first. The most important thing I learned during the time was following the signs. 11 past the hour was my sign that my reality would soon be changing. One night, my cousin blurted that maybe it was a sign the universe was humbling me. It very well could've been. My ego was destroying my soul. And God saved me before it was too late. The fact that I was looking at the clock 11 past the hour every time at a random hour was most definitely a sign that something was trying to communicate with me and letting me know that major changes would be coming into play soon. It happened before my parents divorced and I moved. It happened before I lost my apartment and car. It also just happened in these last two months because believe it or not, I used my thought and mind to send that energy into the universe to put me in a better situation than I was. 

 ***‚ÄòOne of the meanings of 11:11 is that the Universe has sampled your thought sequence and whatever you were intensely thinking about will manifest almost instantly in your physical reality. So if you are feeling really good about the thoughts you are focused on, rest assured that the thoughts you are sending to the Universe will soon manifest in your life. However, if you're having a thought that triggers an unpleasant feeling, you understand that you can shift your thought to a more positive one in order to attract a positive experience into your reality.‚Äô -*** [***WillowSoul.com***](https://willowsoul.com/blogs/numbers/5-reasons-why-you-are-seeing-11-11-the-meaning-of-1111) 

Now I live in North Carolina in a nice home with some roommates, but with a little more knowledge of what life is all about. My journey has yet to cease but I will use my power of thought to create my reality from now on. That is what I want each and everyone one of you to understand. Your thought creates your reality and your signs are something you should pay attention to.

Today is 11/11. Use it to power your energy through the gateway so your thoughts can become your reality. You are going to be thrown some hard times, but you will always get what you create. God has your back, He has mine, and I have yours. We are all spiritual beings. Pray for me, I will pray for you always. 

***""Every time you see this Number, your Spiritual Guides, your Higher Self, are indicating that you have a window of opportunity for manifestation in your life. What were you thinking at that moment? Or you can also align your thoughts at that moment to something you truly crave and that is in sync with your Soul.‚Äô*** [***Blog.Spiritualify.com***](https://blog.spiritualify.com/the-wonderful-energies-of-the-11-11-portal-on-november-11th-2019/)

I want to thank anyone who read through this entire thing. Sorry for making it so long but I woke up with this on my mind and this is what it produced. I feel the universe has asked me to do this. I only wish blessings for you and everyone else in this amazing world.

spirituality,Shadow work - coping with rejection,"So i had this friendship to a man who had not much time for me and often cancelled our dates last minutes. He was really nice to me but in this matter he was really unreliable and selfish because he knew that i was really hurted by those cancellings and that he seldom found time to see me. Since i was so hurted I quit all contact to him because i didnt want him to hurt me anymore. So now my questions: 
I know that there are some shadows inside of me otherwise i wouldnt have reacted in that way. I know that I have a big fear of being rejected, to lose loved ones, to give up nice times with people i normally like and that somebody doesn‚Äòt acknowledges me and doesn‚Äòt sees me and my values. So if i assume that this special person came into my life to present me this fear of being overseen and ignored how should i handle it? I know that i have to love myself in order to accept that there is nobody out there who is commited to appreciated me except of myself. So in consequence i should accept that he hasn‚Äòt much interest in me. But is it right to see my own value that i shouldnt invest so many feelings and stress into somebody who doesn‚Äòt appreciates me? I think it is a normal reaction to quit contact to somebody with whome i am not on the same level. But I am struggling with the thought that I maybe suppress this shadow by throwing this person out of life instead of living with the feeling of being rejected by him over and over again. Do you think my lesson is to be strong and leave people that make me sad behind me or that I shouldn‚Äòt be sad about being treated like that?",1604866775.0

heey guys

I've been into spirituality for a while now, specifically non religious. it's really helped me in the past, I really feel like I had it 'figured out', people would come to me for advice, I had fulfilling and interesting conversations, I felt like I finally started living. I want to say that since a particularly stressful life event almost two years ago I have lost faith and my mental health has been worse than ever. I've kind of given up hope, although sometimes I catch glimpses of it. truths about the universe and goodness don't make sense to me anymore, when before I had so much clarity. lately I've been journalling every morning and night, starting the day off with gratitude, meditating, reading books like 'the power of now' by Eckhart Tolle. I'm trying. I've been manifesting through quarantine, saying affirmations, spending time in nature. I still feel like something is missing, like I am broken, because I've been working so hard but I still want to kill myself so desperately. I feel like I just need some help, some guidance. what am I doing wrong? why do I feel so alone, so lost and so hopeless?",1604647198.0

spirituality,You are the way,"Some people do believe that they are something separate from everything that exists. But you can only exist because of your surroundings. Without the surroundings, you wouldn't exist. Sound exists because of silence, and silence exists because of sound. We all breathe the same air, and our bodies are made up out of elements from the earth. When you eat an apple for example, the apple becomes you. And also the earth exists because of the surroundings. Imagine earth without space. Everything is connected. Even the moon is connected with you. The moon affects the whole ocean. And your body is mostly water. So of course the moon affects you too. Everything is one. And because everything is one, you are part of the way. And therefore you will go the way of the way. There is no possibility to escape the way. Escaping the way would be like leaving your body with your own body. You are like a tree that comes out of the earth and returns back to the earth. You are like a drop of a wave, which will go the way of the wave.

spirituality,I think I had an awakeawakening,"Hey guys. So for a few years I have been trying to have some sort of enlightenment. I want to be able to connect and better understand myself and my existence. I feel as though spiritually is the most effective way to become connected and come out of the hole of depression, anxiety and those feelings of hopelessness. 

A few years ago I started focusing on my spirituality. I was in an extremely unhealthy relationship but had a really hard time leaving it. One day during a meditation session I felt as though a flip had switched and I got the strength to leave the relationship. After leaving the relationship I felt free. I became happy, motivated and stress free.

Months passed and I felt like I had lost touch with my spirituality. I moved to a new location and started a new job and This is when I fell into a deep hole of depression. I had a lack of motivation and I stopped getting any exercise and my mind felt so blurred.  I also began to experience immense back pain (especially in my lower back). It was not like any normal back pain I had ever felt. I could never find the right way to release this pain. This pain went on for about three weeks. What does this pain mean? Does it have anything to do with my chakras being blocked possibly? 

In recent weeks, I have been drawn back to this idea of awareness and began to spend more time meditating. With meditation, I have noticed that my back is slowly ‚Äúreleasing‚Äù from its pain and I feel more connected with my body. I have also become increasingly aware of my thoughts and emotions. I have been drawn to the universe and ask myself a lot of questions about it‚Äôs existence, as well as my own. I am beginning to feel more energetically connected. However, I still feel waves of disconnection. But I have increasingly become more aware of these feelings. 

So I am here to ask, have I had a spiritual awakening? Is this similar to what anybody else has experienced?
What does it mean when sometimes I feel so connected and aware.... but I am so quick to loose this connection? And does anyone else fall into a depressive loop when they loose this connection? How can I practice to remain aware and how can I become more connected with my spirituality? 

This is all very new to me but I feel very drawn to it. I‚Äôm posting in search of any insight/guidance on my journey to enlightenment.",1606116837.0

And they¬¥re all beautiful If you think for a moment that you are not beautiful, then you are probably comparing yourself with someone else or an idea in your mind. If you would not compare yourself with someone else or with the perfect picture in your mind. Then you will be able to accept yourself. And when you will be able to accept yourself, then you will be able to love yourself. To see the beauty in yourself.

spirituality,Can someone help me? I have weird experiences that have happened to me all my life but a lot more recently... is there a name for it? is it a known thing?,"Okay. I‚Äôm not quite sure how to accurately describe this, and I am not the best with words haha so bare with me!

Sometimes I will just have a random thought, and then something that is closely related to that thought will happen a few hours later or sometimes even minutes later.
 
For example, the other day it was late at night and I had my airpods in and was listening to music really loud, so I couldn‚Äôt hear anything else. I randomly thought to myself ‚Äúif my house alarm went off, would I be able to hear it?‚Äù .... 15 minutes later my house alarm goes off (it hasn‚Äôt gone off in years)

Another example... I randomly just started thinking about an old childhood friend that I haven‚Äôt seen or spoke to in probably over 10 years... nor has anyone in my family mentioned this person... that night my mom started talking about that person out of no where...

A third example, about a year ago, I had planned to take myself out on a date (cringey I know) but right before I left, I started to get a really bad feeling, like something was telling me not to go and I thought to myself ‚Äúoh what if I get into a car accident‚Äù I decide to go anyway and I do, in fact, get into a car accident 

This could be absolutely nothing, but things like that happen to me all the time and always have, for as long as I can remember. Those are just the few instances that I remember... most of the time it is something subtle that it could just be a coincident... but it happens so often that it seems questionable to me

Does anyone know what this is or possibly what it means?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

Edit: another example!! about two weeks ago I was about to head to the store and before I left in my head I was like ‚Äúwhat if I someone asks me for my number at target?‚Äù (So weird, I know) and sure enough, while I was at the store, a guy came up to me and asked for my number",1606175630.0

spirituality,The horny Celibate,"The horny Celibate is a metaphor about a man who realized his mistake, when he made the resolution to remain celibate... While he was not horny

Resolutions to your Self are a fearful person's scapegoat for having resolve. Instead of trusting your Self to remain true to your resolve in every moment you have, you take the easy way out. You make a resolution at a single moment in time where it seemed doable, and let your Self be held hostage to that resolution in the moments to come.

This is the Ego who has stepped in. The Ego loves to control everything, to predict the very future. Because the Ego above all else, fears everything it does not control. And what it fears the most, is the realization that what it does not control, is everything itself.

The futility of this approach is demonstrated time and time again. The influx of guests at a fitness hall at the start of the year, which disappears again not two weeks later. The amount of times supposed celibate, holy men, have committed to illicit acts against children.

Resolve exists, resolutions do not. Recognizing the difference between the two means recognition of Truth about Self. Self is not an immutable construct of identity that Ego would lead one to believe. Self is volatile, unpredictable, liberated.

Self would have resolve to go work out more. Self would work out once a week, and be proud. Ego would make a resolution to work out twice a week from now on. Ego would be disappointed in Self, when Self only managed to work out once a week.

spirituality,Can anyone tell me what the no.23 means ? Please can someone help me,"I see this number everywhere. And I literally mean everywhere and especially if I'm not looking for it.
Warning this is lengthy lol. So thank you if you take the time to read it. 

I started seeing this number at the beginning of the year at very specific and important moments in my life. Let's just say I was having some relationship issues and I was moving out of an old season and into a new season of my life. This number in particular is the date of my ""exes"" birthday  and the relationship I'm referring to is to do with him yes. I started seeing this number right before his birthday and very randomly as well, even in moments I had not been thinking about him. His birthday is In the beginning of the year and we ended things a month or so before his birthday. 
Long story short but after we ending things we starting talking again. And things took a turn for the worst and then he  ghosted me  I haven't spoken to him since april. We have mutual friend's as well. So him completely cutting me out of his life sucks. It breaks my heart because none of us would have seen this ending. And this is the one broken relationship in my life. 
But back to the point. I still see the number 23 everywhere. I so happen to see it at the exact moment I decide to check the time. Like it will be 11 23 or something. And this will be like after not checking the time for hours. Or if i so happen to look at how many seconds left on the microwave the moment I do it will be 23 seconds. But these are only a few examples. The point is sometimes I can go days without seeing it and other days I will see it multiple times in a day. And at moments like after I had just had a discussion with my mum about my ex(he knows my family well and has been to my house a  couple of times) or after I just thought about him.

spirituality,The Solution to The Mystery of Consciousness,"Consciousness is the foundational phenomenon of all spirituality; all spirituality takes place through Consciousness. Thus genuine insights into the true nature of Consciousness can lead to great spiritual insights. How revolutionary would it be if it was Scientifically proved beyond all reasonable doubt that all the basic Energy and particles of our Universe possess basic Consciousness? The spiritual implications are large and quite immediate. 

In this podcast I solve the twin scientific mysteries of Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness at the level of popular science. I explain the Hard Problem of Consciousness and the false assumption that creates it. I then replace this false assumption with the correct Fundamental Postulate of Consciousness. Then I state The Law of Privacy of Consciousness and use it in conjunction with the correct Postulate of Consciousness to give the first simple, logical and intuitive interpretation of the experimental results of Quantum Mechanics. On the same channel is a formal and rigorous proof of the same, as well as refutations of the most common objections.

spirituality,The Power of I AM,"The power of I AM

Do you realize how powerful you are? Truly? The weight of your words and the power of your intentions? 

Whatever you say after the words I AM, you will manifest and become. The things you call yourself and truly believe you are, you will be.  You are a powerful Co-creator in this universe. Your words have so much power. Your emotions hold so much weight, that you aren‚Äôt even aware of. When you tell yourself the same thing over and over again, your subconscious then programs it into your consciousness, into your personality, into your body. It begins to grow and manifest until you have fully embodied that energy that you keep giving yourself.

You literally are programing your mind to vibration at these frequencies. Even subconsciously.  You will start seeing these things manifest in your life. When you say, ‚Äú I am beautiful‚Äù  you will see the beauty in everything. When you say, ‚ÄúI love myself‚Äù, you will love others as you love yourself, and that love will be returned. Everything in your current reality will reflect that. 

The opposite is also true. You will cheat, lie, and sabotage yourself to keep up with the negative narratives like ‚Äú I am not good enough‚Äù or ‚Äú I‚Äôm dumb‚Äù, ‚Äú I‚Äôm so bad at math‚Äù. So you never try to improve those skills. You said, ‚Äú I am‚Äù, and therefore you are. You will never be better than that because you have placed those limitations on yourself. And everything in your current reality will reflect that. 

This is why it is important to evaluate yourself and see what blocks and what beliefs you may have that need to be released, that no longer serve you. Some beliefs, people, and habits are only meant to serve us for a certain time. The flow of life must keep moving and we can‚Äôt become too attracted to anything. We must always find ways to improve the areas in our lives that no longer bring us love, happiness, or joy. We must eliminate the ideas that we have to be unhappy for others to like us. For others to be happy. We must eliminate the behavior of investing time into things that don‚Äôt make us happy. It is time to start taking care of yourself, loving yourself, and aligning yourself with the universe to live your best life.",1606111229.0

spirituality,Is my thinking fucked up about this?,"So I have always had an issue with the idea of being grateful and making gratitude lists etc.  Not because I think they‚Äôre not helpful or positive but because they seem to have a fundamental issue.  The issue that I see with it is that you are labeling things you *have* in your life as ‚Äúgood‚Äùas compared to what life would be like WITHOUT that thing.  So what about the person who doesn‚Äôt have that? And what happens when you lose that thing?  It reminds me of when people say ‚Äúit could be worse.‚Äù  Like, why does gratitude have to come from a contrast to the experience of someone else?  

Also, isn‚Äôt gratitude a feeling and not really something you can force?  Don‚Äôt you *feel* grateful rather than *be* grateful? Why do we tell people to *be* grateful when gratitude is something you feel? In my own experience, gratitude is so much easier when I‚Äôm already happy.  When people say gratitude is what creates happiness, is this not a question of chicken or the egg?  

Also, if I‚Äôm scratching myself to find gratitude, am I not telling the universe that I am content with what I have and I wouldn‚Äôt need more to be happy?

I still make gratitude lists every day and I share these with my friends who also send me their gratitude lists.  It is nice to do but it also feels so disingenuous.

spirituality,¬®Give this an upvote if you think our thoughts create our reality.¬® ~ Top post,"The title of this post is the title of the top post of the month within the spirituality subreddit. And I wanted to spread some more information about this topic.

Firstly I want to say that ¬®our thoughts create our reality.¬® is an amazing sentence. And I agree with the sentence. But there is some more that can be talked about when thinking about that sentence.

And that can be done by using the yin and yang symbol

As you know there is a white dot within the black half, and a black dot within the white half. And that's also true for our reality.

The whole universe would be irrelevant if you didnt exist. And if the universe didn't exist, then you would also be irrelevant. Because you can't exist without the universe. So what I'm trying to say is that black implies white, and white implies black. And the universe exists because of you, and you exist because of the universe.

A miracle 

Besides that does our thinking influence our reality. Because when you are thinking all the time, then you are observing your thoughts instead of reality. It's only when you stop thinking that you can experience reality in its purest form.

And there is one last thing that I want to say and that is the fact that your world exists on what you focus upon. You can't focus on everything there is, so make sure to focus on something beautiful, because then your world will become beautiful.

spirituality,‚ÄúWhen spiders unite they can tie down a lion.‚Äù ~Ethiopian Proverb,"In diversity there is beauty, and there is strength.

We may have different religions, different languages, different colored skin tones, and different perspectives, but at the end of the day...we are all just human beings living on a floating rock in space, just trying to make sense of what this human experience is. 

So why do we put up so many walls between one another, only to create more division? Only through the openness to understand what is different from us, will we ever truly attain unity. 

So take a moment today, to try to understand someone or something that is outside your comfort zone, outside your realm of knowledge. Everything can ultimately serve as something we can learn and further grow from, if we choose to see it that way. 

Our differences shouldn't divide us, but rather, they should unify us. Divided we fall, United we stand.

spirituality,What I‚Äôve come to believe is the ‚Äútrue meaning of life‚Äù from books I‚Äôve read so far,"Note: I‚Äôm aware of the DMT: The Spirit Molecule book, but I haven‚Äôt gotten around to reading it yet. Everything that I have written in this post is my attempt at piecing together the puzzle that is life from my own studying. I‚Äôm sure that what I‚Äôm saying could be similar to what the author of The Spirit Molecule has written, but this is my interpretation in much less text than a book. I‚Äôm not saying that any of this is fact, but it‚Äôs something I truly believe in and I welcome any feedback/guidance.


It started with the Tibetan Book of the Dead. If you‚Äôre not familiar with that book, it‚Äôs the text that Tibetan Buddhists have used to assist a dying person‚Äôs soul to rebirth. The version I have is a commentary on that text, which goes into detail on why such steps are carried out and what the soul goes through during that 49-day gap of death and rebirth. It talked a lot about the different levels of light you will see that represent the different stages of your soul‚Äôs transition, the visuals, and how your religion directly influences those visuals. 

Upon reading this, I recalled random tidbits of information I had come across earlier in life: 1. your brain releases the hallucinogenic chemical DMT at the time of death, and 2. there have been religious people who underwent a near death experience and ‚Äúsaw God‚Äù. I began to connect the dots to what the Tibetan Buddhists preach; the visuals we see when we die (or absence of visuals, if you live your whole life without belief in anything) could be from that DMT induced trip at death. You become aware that you are dying, and you see in your mind what you think happens after death (ex: if you‚Äôre Christian, you will see Heaven, etc). After I finished that book I began reading scientific journals on the topic of near death experiences. 

In pretty much all of the interviews conducted with people who had NDE, they had seen a light. They felt as if they were watching themselves from the corner of the room outside of their body. Regardless of religion, they felt a sense of joy and a willingness to get to the other side. The out of body experience at death, along with the fact that there are people (especially young children) who can recall parts of their past lives, finally convinced me that there indeed is such thing as souls and that our soul has lived multiple lives. My next question was: what is it that determines how our soul‚Äôs next life is? Is it truly a ‚Äúbirth lottery‚Äù?

Common phrases I‚Äôve heard my whole life, like ‚Äúeverything happens for a reason‚Äù, ‚Äúactions have consequences‚Äù, and the short watered-down remarks of karma began to make sense at a deeper level to me. I searched deeper into Buddhism, which at the time was something I was entirely new to as I had been an atheist my whole life. I began to read up on karma and how every soul acquires karmic debt in every life. Essentially, what you have done in your past life is reflected into your new one, whether it be good or bad. I started thinking about how this ideology might have played out in the earlier evolutionary days when there was no intelligence that could make choices based on morality. 

In the beginning, species only knew two things: survive and populate. Now we have advanced into a society of free will, and no one is on the same page on the topic of religion. Religion disagrees with things like sex for pleasure instead of procreation (which I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with), but people fail to realize these ‚Äúrules‚Äù were put in place in order to keep us on that path of survive, populate, reincarnate. Now that we have so much free will, we have strayed from that path and seek all the pleasures that humanity has to offer. Because we enjoy those pleasures so much, our ‚Äúconsequence‚Äù is returning as a human again in life because we desire to continue reveling in humanity. The next lives we live are based on those actions/pleasures. Those who truly want to break free from this cycle of continuous human life can be liberated.

On top of learning more about Buddhism, I also started reading more about the Law of Attraction. The first author I read on this topic was Neville Goddard, who interpreted the Bible as not a retelling of actual events that is to be taken literally, but rather a message of how *we* are God and how *we* have the power to shape our lives the way we want if we desire it enough. I have manifested things throughout my entire life without knowing it; I used to joke that I always get what I want. Fortunately, you really *can* get what you want, and that‚Äôs the biggest thing in life that I wish more people could realize. However, as I mentioned earlier, your present life is based on the actions of your past ones: if you were meant to come across such information, then it will present itself to you if your life‚Äôs circumstances call for it. So I trust that the right people will figure it out in time. 

This is all I can get out of my brain at the moment without making the post too long. I truly hope there will be some individuals out there that will read every word, because I‚Äôd really like either some confirmation or criticism to help myself develop stronger beliefs.",1605752349.0

spirituality,"The true meaning of the Beast, dragon, 666, of Revelation and how it relates to spiritual progress","Note: the word 'Maya' is used alot this interpretation of the the beast
 
Maya means ""the illusion of separation from¬†God, which results in the excessive and unnecessary attraction to the external world.

This universe was made to be utilized for spiritual progress.¬† When this view is forgotten and things start to be used in unnatural ways for the satisfaction of the lower nature, the same becomes Maya (illusion).
For he who follows the¬†Darma¬†of everything, there is no Maya."" 




Tablet Twenty-Four
Chapter 13

*""And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy."" (Rev. 13:1)*

&lt;1&gt;This beast is different than the beasts in Daniel, chapter 7. Those arose from the ""great sea"" (collective consciousness). But this beast arises from ""the sea"" (the consciousness of one human).
&lt;2&gt;This beast is the symbol of the desires for the things¬†Maya¬†(illusion of the external world) offers. The¬†dragon¬†is the¬†Maya¬†itself.¬†&lt;3&gt;But the beast is that desire which arises in the consciousness (sea) and brings attachment to humanity.¬†Maya¬†is attraction to the external world, and desire is the wanting of the fruits of this attractive world.

&lt;4&gt;The seven heads are the seven attractions to the seven powers of¬†Maya¬†(survival, food, power, beauty, false attraction to the sexual world, wealth, and¬†blind intellect).¬†&lt;5&gt;The ten horns are the¬†devils which result from this attraction (greed, fear, anger, envy, false prestige, etc.). With these desires to the attraction of the external world (Maya), blasphemy will come to humanity. They will forget¬†God.¬†&lt;6&gt;Desires arise from the consciousness of the human (""the sea""). By purifying the consciousness, desires also become purified and the¬†dragon¬†becomes a dove. Then the desires will be(come)¬†Divine.

*""And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the¬†dragon¬†gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority."" (Rev. 13:2)*

&lt;7&gt;It is really desires that make people slaves of¬†Maya. As long as there is no desire for the attractions of¬†Maya, it (Maya) has no power over the¬†Soul. But the moment desire is stimulated, man becomes its slave. So the¬†dragon¬†gives the powers to this beast to bring people to his feet.¬†&lt;8&gt;However, only excess or mundane desires are bad. Desires which are according to¬†Daharma, for spiritual progress, and to be(come)¬†Divine, are good.

*""And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast."" (Rev. 13:3)*

&lt;9&gt;""One of his heads as it were wounded"" means that by the coming of¬†Prophets¬†and great spiritual teachers, people will lose their excess attachments for survival, because other attractions really come when a person feels he is only his body. This brings great fear and attachment to the external world and results in awakening the other attractions of¬†Maya¬†(illusions).¬†&lt;10&gt;So the head, which is attraction for survival, was wounded many times. But later on, people again will become attached to life and that head of the beast will be healed.

&lt;11&gt;All the people wondered how this beast could make them go astray and not find the answers. This occurred because they were bound by the desires of their lower natures and could not understand.

*""And they worshipped the¬†dragon¬†which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?"" (Rev. 13:4)*

&lt;12&gt;People worship the¬†devil¬†(Maya) through their desires (the beast). Because they are in their lower natures, they think life consists of the attraction to the external world and that there is no other reality.¬†&lt;13&gt;They spend their lives desiring and chasing it, ""Who is like unto the beast?"" They never believe that the beast can be destroyed. But by practice, knowledge, and faith, with His¬†Grace, false desires will fade away.

*""And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months."" (Rev. 13:5)*

&lt;14&gt;Desires (the beast) chatter continually and tempt all to do¬†evil¬†and follow their lower natures. The beast is the one who brings temptations and is responsible for the fall of man. He tempted the¬†woman¬†(lower nature) to eat of the tree of knowledge (forbidden actions) and then gave it to man (symbol of the higher nature). Because of these actions, they were thrown out of¬†Eden¬†(higher consciousness).
&lt;15&gt;So it is desire which blasphemies, tries to defile the Laws of¬†God, and attempts to make man follow what is good in his eyes but not in His.
&lt;16&gt;""And power was given unto him to continue forty and two months."" Forty-two months again is 1,260 days, or 3,500 years. So the¬†false ego¬†has been left alone to make humanity fall for 3,500 years, exactly the same amount of time that has been given to the¬†Prophets¬†and the woman!

*""And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against¬†God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in¬†heaven."" (Rev. 13:6)*

&lt;17&gt;The¬†dragon, these desires of the¬†false ego¬†of the human, will continue to deceive humanity, blaspheme against the truth (His Name), and try to destroy it.¬†&lt;18&gt;Also, those who are in their lower natures cause trouble for those who are in their higher selves, ""and them that dwell in¬†heaven.""

*""And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."" (Rev. 13:7)*

&lt;19&gt;""To make war with the saints,"" means that the real spirituality will be lost because of the power of these desires in humans. All the nations and kindreds will be deceived because of this.

*""And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."" (Rev. 13:8)*

&lt;20&gt;""That dwell upon the earth"" means those who are in their lower natures.¬† ""Whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb"" refers to those who have not reached higher consciousness or those who do not try to be(come)¬†Divine.¬†¬†&lt;21&gt;The Lamb is he who overcame his lower nature (""slain"") before the creation of the manifested world (""from the foundation of the world."")

*""If any man have an ear, let him hear.""
""He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints."" (Rev. 13:9-10)*

&lt;22&gt;Whoever pursues animality will go to destruction and animality. That is the Law of the universe.¬† He who kills by the sword for selfish pursuance eventually will be killed also by the sword because of the Law of¬†Karma. That is what makes Saints believe and have patience, because the Laws of the universe never fail. The reaction of the action will stop if the lesson is learned.¬†&lt;23&gt;However, action by knowledge for bringing harmony and peace, creates no¬†karma¬†(samskaras).¬† As we saw, power was given to the fourth horseman to kill by sword (Rev. 6:8), but he will not be killed by sword because he was doing it to fulfill His Will.

*""And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a¬†dragon."" (Rev. 13:11)*

&lt;24&gt;This beast symbolizes the attachment which develops when a person becomes attracted to¬†Maya. So¬†Maya¬†gives his authority to the desires in man, and fulfillment of desires bring attachment. His two horns are wealth and power, which enable a man to fulfill his desires.¬†&lt;25&gt;He comes from the earth, which is attachment to the external world or carnal self.

*""And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."" (Rev. 13:12)*

&lt;26&gt;Again, this is the power of attachment which is symbolized by the beast. It causes humans to become greedy. Greed brings more attraction, attraction brings desire, fulfillment of desire brings more attachment, and attachment brings more greed. That is how this beast makes people worship the one before him, ""causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast.""

*""And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on earth in the sight of men,"" (Rev. 13:13)*

&lt;27&gt;He brings so much attraction to humanity that they become completely drawn to whatever is in the external world. They become amazed with the fire play (the illuminated world of¬†Maya), the parties, and everything that is bright, shiny, and makes the eyes feel it is beautiful, and they follow these things. He brings many wonders to them, and they become more attached to these wonders. They become more and more bound to their egoistical desires.

*""And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live."" (Rev. 13:14)*

&lt;28&gt;""Make an image to the beast"" means that desires come as an image in the conscious¬†mind.¬† Then the image becomes a desire.¬† Fulfillment of desires increases their desires for the external world, which was the first beast. They will have more desires, which will bring more attachment. More attachment will increase the attraction, and attraction will increase the desires in this cycle that goes on and on.
&lt;29&gt;That is the reason why people in this age have more desires, because of the images that stimulate them in all walks of life, from street advertisements, T.V. and radio images, and other¬†Mayaistical images available everywhere.¬†&lt;30&gt;More false desires create more dissatisfaction.

*""And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."" (Rev. 13:15)*

&lt;31&gt;The attachment has the power to awaken the desires in a person and bind him to the external world, ""to give life unto the image of the beast."" Fulfillment of these awakened images brings more attachment, and so on.
&lt;32&gt;""And cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."" Those who do not follow the crowd and do not stay lost in¬†Maya¬†will be cast out or shunned (""should be killed"") by the lost crowd.

*""And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a¬†mark¬†in their right hand, or in their foreheads:"" (Rev. 13:16)*

&lt;33&gt;These people who follow their desires and are attached to the external world will be recognized so easily as they will have a¬†mark¬†on themselves. A person with understanding (a person whose eyes are opened) will recognize them with the first sight.¬†&lt;34&gt;The¬†mark¬†is the ""GREED"" of these people for more and more, never being satisfied.

*""And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the¬†mark, of the name of the beast, or the number of his name."" (Rev. 13:17)*

&lt;35&gt;The¬†mark¬†of the beast is greed, especially for money and external possessions. And you cannot buy or sell anything without money. This is what people are attracted to. The people (in this lost world) who have this¬†mark¬†strive to gain more and more external things in life. They try to buy and sell as much as they can.¬†&lt;36&gt;In this age, the prestige, beauty, and height of each person is related to the possessions that he has in the external world, but not his spiritual knowledge. These possessions, which are the¬†mark¬†of the beast that bring more attachment, desires, and excess attraction to the external world, are¬†Maya¬†(illusion).

*""Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred three score and six."" (Rev. 13:18)*

&lt;37&gt;The number 666 would be treated as 6 + 6 + 6 = 18. The number 1 is for leadership and 8 is for prosperity or material longing. Therefore it represents those who lead a life in¬†Maya. The number 18 also can be shown as 1 + 8 = 9. The number 9 represents the ultimate, the completion. The number 6 represents beauty or attraction of the external world. So the number 666 is the number of those who have reached the ultimate depth of¬†Maya.¬† They are greatly attracted to the external world, so their desire for what it offers is great (beast with seven horns). They are very attached to it and are extremely greedy.¬† The name of such a person is 666 and is in the camp of the¬†devil.
&lt;38&gt;The number 144,000 also is equal with 9 (1 + 4 + 4 = 9). As explained above, the number 1 is the number of leadership, but the number 4 is of strength, manifestation (of the Divine) and forebearing. That is why it is the number of the Chosen Ones.¬† They are leaders (1) who, with great forbearing (4) manifest (4) Divine attributes (God).

Physical: There is a buttload of rough heavy energies blasting us right now. Drink more water to allow the energies to more flow through you with less stress to your body. 

Mental: What if most of your anxiety is due to your advanced psychic and ""clair"" abilities? (clairs being seeing, hearing, knowing, feeling, tasting, smelling) The entire world has been put on tilt and as a quantum being, as many of you are, you came in with extremely tuned psychic abilities, what if you're just picking up all the negative static in the air through your every wide open clair? What if as a process of softening the energies, you simply filter every ""uncomfortable"" thought through your heart to assess whether it's really, really true. (If it's born of fear and not love, it is often not the truth)

Emotional:  What if all those anxious and stressful feelings are not yours but directed at you because you're a healer?  What if they are simply proof of your amazing empathing abilities?  What if as a healer, these darker energies are meant to felt momentarily as a scan or a quick energy read?  What if you are not meant to process and churn the hell out of them them until you're exhausted and angry. What if as a healer, all you are supposed to do with all this junky anxiety and stress is to command that it go back to the light in which it came to be healed. What if as a healer, you CAN more effectively heal when you're not processing others people's energy and trying to heal it for them but your main job here is to stand in your own power, keep your own channels clear of dark debris by always sending it back to the light and just be the brilliant healer that you are?

Spiritual: What if, all this absolute effery is simply here to help you find your superpower(s)? What if you're here on purpose and that before came into all this chaos, you were excited about it because you knew without a doubt, ""You got this!  You were made for this!""

I was avoiding talking about it like the plague (not the current plague, the Black Death one). Meanwhile my mental health was going downhill, and I was feeling spiritually stagnant. I was depressed, having weird and uncomfortable dreams, I wasn‚Äôt getting as many synchronicities as I‚Äôm used to beyond the ever present angel numbers, but those only do so much.

Last night though I finally texted them and laid it all out. There‚Äôs some stuff to work through, but it‚Äôs all out in the open now.

spirituality,Has anyone ever gone through something like this? feeling weird,"So to start off I wanna give some background. Im a 20 year old guy and I go to college. I grew up middle class most of my life ( I say most because before my mom graduated college we lived way more frugally and were basically poor)

So I started meditating about 4 months ago and at first it was pretty lame and I felt like I was getting nowhere. Eventually (about 2-3 months in) I started to be able to sit for 30 minutes straight and meditate. This is were I would get into a state where I felt almost unaware of my physical body (I don't mean astral projection but more like if I had my hands on my lap they would feel like they were part of my lap and not individual hands) I would basically get into trance like states if I focused on my breath for 15+ minutes.

After this I started to become aware of thoughts and ultimately started to develop this gut feeling. This gut feeling was weird kind of like a mix between butterflies and anxiety in my chest/torso. Then out of the blue my thinking changed.

This is the part that worries me. I feel like my perception started to change. I feel like im having a paradigm shift. Before I used to think people were crazy when they said things like ""lifting the veil"" or ""third eye opening"" Believe me it still seems kind of odd to me. Its just that I understand the notion of things like ""you are the universe"" and ""reality is a reflection of your internal state"". I feel like I understand what it means to be in the present moment. That time is an illusion and there is no future or past there is only the present. This is the part that bugs me. I feel like reality is created by thoughts, that im the center of the universe.

This last part really hits something deep in me. Whenever I focus on the present, everything in my mind feels clear and at that moment I feel blissed out. Its really a feeling that cant be put into words.

Anybody every felt like this? Is this me becoming delusional? Someone help me out

spirituality,"Oh god, the panic...","Look y‚Äôall. I am straight up PANICKED. I feel like life is some weird acid trip-esque monstrosity that is throwing all of my baggage in my face from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. 

I‚Äôm not sure why, but I fall in love with liars. I‚Äôm so ridiculously gullible bc I don‚Äôt lie! I DONT LIE!! What in the actual Gregorian chant butt sex fuckery is going on?! ‚ÄúWe attract what we are.‚Äù NO. Well. I mean I lie to myself, but who doesn‚Äôt? Or maybe it‚Äôs the escapism within me, probably the same reason I used to meditate for hours at a time. Lies are a form of escaping reality, don‚Äôt you think? 

I wonder if I‚Äôm having some kind of twin flame situation (my instance of heartbreak) Bc the life themes are tripping me out. I‚Äôm not sure what I want as all my options are equally shitty in nature. I am jobless and heartbroken. Also‚ÄîI‚Äôm a fucking cheater. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm trapped in a dead relationship with a currently-decent person who used to be a manipulative covert narcissist. I fought 85% of the narcissistic tendencies out of this man, and you know what? Now I‚Äôm only in it for the comfort. Now I‚Äôm the abuser. How is that for poetic irony? 

What does this have to do with spirituality? I‚Äôm not sure. Nothing. Everything. Some kind of twisted play on themes and thoughts manifesting for me in the physical. I cannot escape the synchronicities. I CANT. 

So I drink. 

And someone told me a few months ago when I posted about about my kundalini energy rising into my solar plexus ‚Äúyou are entering the dark night of soul.‚Äù And WHAT THE FUCK. My whole goddamn life has been a dark night of the fucking soul. 

I have a laundry list of trauma. Sexual abuse, alienation from my peers, loss of my possessions after a terribly horrible personal mistake (house fire via carelessly dropped cigarette), my parents divorced Bc of this, I watched my mom lose her mind as the icing on top of the cake. Self loathing took over, i got addicted and then knocked up by an abusive asshole. Decided to have my son‚Äîhe showed me my value and taught me about love. Thank god for him. Life was okay for a bit until I met my current partner. Fell in love fast, super fast, and then stuff wasn‚Äôt adding up, which is when I realized he was manipulative and emotionally abusive. Gaslit the ever loving shit out of me. I was addicted to drugs again. Overdosed. Lost my mind. My dad betrayed me over money. We don‚Äôt talk. That psychotic break tho... that was the turning point. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I‚Äôm no walk in the park. I am moody and depressed. I‚Äôm too smart for my own good. I needle the fuck out of everyone and everything, mostly Bc I want the truth and efficiency is of the utmost importance. Fucking hurt me with the truth‚ÄîI want it. It‚Äôs never as cruel as a sweet lie. I am incredibly intelligent and intuitive which makes me highly neurotic. I don‚Äôt fit it in with most people. It‚Äôs rare for me to find someone to fit with. 

Oh god, the person I fit so well with is now gone. This is my problem. It was only two months, but it was non stop conversation. A consistent running dialogue. I hate him for being gone. HATE HIM. But it‚Äôs only Bc I love him so much. It‚Äôs ripping my soul out by the silver cord, I don‚Äôt even care that he lied all the time! It was never about important things anyway. I can identify the real from the fake, looking back. But my god, this man thinks I‚Äôm a conglomerate of people. He asked me if I was a website. I cracked his consciousness open so his guilt bit him and he blames ME. 

When I broke a couple years ago, I found myself. I actually had joy for almost a whole year. I know this is in me. And look‚ÄîI‚Äôm not trying to be a victim. Every ounce of pain has been galvanizing me for something. 

My god I‚Äôm praying this is the case. My tarot cards don‚Äôt like him, but my heart loves him completely. Our relationship was fair and the things that worked REALLY WORKED.

spirituality,Can someone please help me. I‚Äôm lost.,"A month ago I had my spiritual awakening and I never believe in anything spiritual before that. I was seeing the world so differently. I understood I had a role to play in life and everyone else does too. This confusing hero feeling I had since I was a kid was finally answer. I learned so much about myself and wanted to help people. I really thought I was on the right path. I learned about the Micheal teaching about reincarnation and did a past life regression session and saw my past lives. I was so happy to know we all have souls! I believed I was an old soul and that‚Äôs why I always felt so left out. I started to do yoga and mediate everyday. 

Reddit was helping me and whenever I needed an answer about what was going on with me, the next day I found the answer. I learned about ‚Äúthe dark night of the soul‚Äù but never really hear anyone that came out of it. I couldn‚Äôt reach out to anyone because no one believe me so I understood that I had to follow my path.. alone. 

Then one day I stumble on this new term called ‚ÄúEarth Angels‚Äù and it resonated with me because it describe my life. I believed that I was an earth Angel and started to do research on it. Earth angels are beings asked to come to earth to help rise the vibration levels of the world. While I was researching it kept repeatedly saying that I need to call on my guides or angels and ask for sign. I decided to asked for a sign and then all of the sudden the lights in my room got brighter and I got scared and notice the lights had a rainbow glow. For some reason I asked to show me the colour red and all the lights went red. I never had anything supernatural happen to me so this was the first for me. My friends were in the room with me and I asked them if they were seeing red. They said no and looked at me crazy. I asked for green and the lights went green. Now I‚Äôm believing I‚Äôm definitely an earth Angel. Some how a light came on my phone to read a book by Doreen Virtue called Earth angels. I downloaded it and read it in 2 days. 

I decided to go on her website to learn more and I found out this woman who has been with the spiritual world for 56 years and very popular, gave up spirituality. She said it was the work of the devil disgusting himself as these beings we call forth. I went on a research rampage for 2 days about ‚Äúnew age‚Äù and I found out about the evil side of spirituality. I saw many videos of people who had nearly the same story as me and how the devil has been tricking them. I read famous yoga teachers, healers, authors and more quit to go to Jesus. It‚Äôs hard for me to ignore that 100‚Äôs of people in my position claim that spiritual actually made their life worst and warning me not to go down that path. I just can‚Äôt believe that everything was orchestrated. Crystals, meditation, tarot, yoga, past life regression were all deceptions. I looked up each and every topic and got the same answer. A lot of people ended up getting possessed by demons, being more depressed and unhappy. We‚Äôre tapping into things we don‚Äôt know about. When we call on these angels or spirits, we have no idea which spirits we are getting or if they are good or not.

I don‚Äôt want to give up on everything and it has taught me to second guess things. I want to know if anyone has been feeling the same way. I want to take certain things from spirituality because it helped me grow so much and want to know the best things I can take without being trick.

spirituality,My Will,"This is my second attempt at writing a death letter. I‚Äôm not sure what i‚Äôd like to say

I guess I was always private so the best thing I could do now that I'm gone is take my chance to be as transparent as I can. I'll say a few things I feel could help people. Firstly, I think it's important to love yourself, no one will ever love you and accept you and catch you and hold you as unconditionally as you ever will. You are your soulmate and who you choose to spend the rest of your life with should mirror the truth that you are enough. 

I was recently struck with a realization about true love - love will keep breaking your heart until it opens. We will throw ourselves at people cyclically throughout our lives until we find the one person who can break our hearts open completely. And when i say open, i mean open fully, truthfully, honestly. With that openness comes a warm pain and realization that one day someone will break open the person who broke you open and then they‚Äôll be ready because once you're open, you're free. You are now ready to receive the honest love you‚Äôve spent your entire life giving away.

Secondly, it's important to decide what you want to eat everyday. Food indecisiveness will harvest havoc across your life. If you don't know what you want to eat for lunch how will you know what you want to do with the rest of your life and who you want to spend it with?

Thirdly, listening is the best gift you could ever give someone. It‚Äôs free and easy, if you don't know what to say just listen and I promise that is enough. 

Die everyday. Go to bed with this last thought ‚Äúdo I feel good dying tonight knowing i did everything i could have possibly done today given my options and circumstances‚Äù practice answering yes as often as you can and i promise you will grow old youthfully and unregretfully

Ensure your actions are rooted in kindness and empathy. 

Music is important, listen to songs you believe in.

You know the craziest thing is I know I'm dead though I feel more alive as ever. It's heavy being human, take things lightly. Laugh to yourself at the absurd perfection of it all. Feeling sad is important, exercise it as often as you need to, otherwise your happiness will feel unsustainable. Hold hands with fear, feel everything you need to feel. Most people struggle sustaining happiness because they have yet to accept sadness. Accept sadness, receive happiness.

Next, comes a paraphrased piece of  insight i shared with one of my dearest friends: 

Throughout life there's a series of cross roads we walk up to at different points. Sometimes the two options are clear and the decision is simple, other times the options are ambiguous and the choice is muddy. Though despite that, the more crossroads we step up to throughout our lives the more prominent of a pattern you begin to notice. Notice your patterns. Choose consciously

It started 2.5 years ago, when I was bored, trying a ""third eye awakening"" meditation. I had a paranormal experience before, but didn't believe any religion / spirituality at this time, didn't think anything would happen. So a while into this, I feel a powerful sensation between my eyes, extremely high heart rate, and tingling all over my body. For the next few weeks, I'm having extremely vivid dreams. Between then and now, I've had a few strong spiritual experiences, but most of them were under the influence of drugs, and I could never quite understand them. A few of those experiences were completely without drugs though. Recently, I had my most powerful and terrifying experience yet, no drugs involved. I felt forces speaking to me in my sleep (this was very distinct from a normal dream) and at one point I fell into a full on acid trip in my dream that lasted about 5 seconds. Cascading negative thoughts, 100s of thoughts per second, each thought exponentially more negative and abstract than the previous. I thought it was impossible to achieve this pattern of thought without drugs, or extensive meditation.

I woke up and I vividly saw a technicolor glowing geometric pattern on the ceiling, morphing. I could see this clearly for about 10 seconds after fully waking up. I'm the kind of guy who never cries, but I was full on shaking and in tears for about 20 minutes before I could compose myself and try to process what happened.

spirituality,1 Step a Day (43),"Looking towards the Future or looking to the Past is the easiest thing for our brain and mind to let us do. Recently, I have learned that our Mind wants us to keep us trapped. Trapped in our comfort zones, trapped in our habits that keep us still and not move forward. The Mind only knows about living in the Past, with dwelling about situations that no longer can be changed, or in the Future, which causes anxiety from something that **might** happen, but 97% of the time, doesn't.

  
Its about taking 1 step a day. Getting out of bed is the 1 step. Drinking water is the 1 step. When I start to focus on a new craft, passion, hobby or anything that has come into my life that wasn't there before, I ask myself, ""Did I do 1 thing towards that specific thing today?"" Yes? Then, Progress has been made. 

  
Its very easy to compare our path and journey to the people we see on social media, who have had their own **Ups** &amp; **Downs**, to get to what you are seeing being posted or shared today.

  
We are **ALL** on different paths with different focuses, different creative endeavours, different strengths, different things to improve and work on, different lives. Be grateful for where **YOU** are in this very moment, at this very second. It is truly divine for **YOU** and makes you the unique self you are. Think about the things you do on a daily basis, the coffee cup you drink out of, the stove you use to cook, the area where you live, the park you go to, the stickers you have on your phone, how your room is decorated or designed. It is all Unique and irreplaceable. It makes you, You &amp; that in itself is what makes you a 1 of 1 Divine Being.

spirituality,Please help me stay on this path,"I have been having violent angry outbursts recently to the point I feel like a monster. I used to meditate daily and have certain little tasks I‚Äôd do to better myself and really felt confident on some path. The past 2 days I finally pushed myself (after a month or so after a big apartment move across states) to meditate and read my books on mindfulness again. I used the morning to do that and I felt great. Both days that I did, but later in the day, I lost myself to the point where I felt and looked like a monster. I didn‚Äôt even recognize myself.

My episodes consist of me throwing things or hurting myself because I am so upset that I set myself back. A minor inconvenience can turn into hell on earth in my head. It feels like it hurts much more when you go from meditating and feeling like you accomplished something to suddenly hitting yourself, yelling at your partner and punching anything around you. I become so enraged and only think of suicide until I am able to calm down or my partner calms me down. It‚Äôs like I only believe my two options are this spirtual path or just ending it all. If not this, then what? Anger makes me feel like all of my practice is fake and I‚Äôm just trying to put a veil over my actual problems. I get so hopeless when I see how angry I become. My anger sky rockets knowing I was doing something right, then I screwed it up by being angry. Which results in me getting more angry due to the setback. 

I want to be better. God, I want to be better than this. I know this is the right and only path for me. I believe every word I read in my books, I know what is needed to live a fulfilling, meaningful life. But whatever is happening keeps getting in the way. I like to believe it‚Äôs some ‚Äúevil force‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt want me to access this mindset and wants me to continue to be addicted to anger and rage and hurt. But I also don‚Äôt want to blame external things for my own behavior. When I lose it, my mind makes me believe everything I‚Äôm doing to better myself is for nothing and it‚Äôs all fake and my possible mental disease is my true nature.

Right now I am solely focused on just becoming a more calm level-headed person. I desperately want an absence of anger. I want to take a step back and maybe start smaller because my anger will not allow me to get the full benefit of my practices.

spirituality,Friend helped spark in me a sense of peace ive been fighting after sending video about spirituality while i was helping him with his mental health,"I have had a war with my self being raised as a christian ,but have seen and know what relgions have done and caused and all the people who dont follow their own books [words.My](https://words.my/) dad is very religious to the point i question if its a coping mechanism I also have schizophrenia and im better but compared to mental health this battle i had with religion and doubts and everything in between my friend sent me this 7 minute video i watched when i woke up that sparked peace and [relief.It](https://relief.It) is funny ,because i was actually talking to him for 6 hours about his mental health little known he said one thing about spirituality which in return helped me more then he knows.

I thought why would an all loving god send gay people to hell while at the same time christians say god is the one true judge yet they look at muslims with hate when it says love all.Stuff like that but after i watched this 7 minute video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK\_fRYaI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI) and the day before i watched the joe rogan and kanye podcast and kanye's unique way of thinking didnt watch to laugh i watch joe alot.Thought about DMT and entities also 2 days before i saw this video my friend texted me whos out of state in 10 words or less explain the meaning of life i said""Love yourself then find the missing puzzle piece needed"" after watching that video i instantly made a blog on my anonymous blog because i had a knot in my stomach and anxiety in a good way i started thinking on so much as im typing for 4 hours straight i was crying out of peace i dont know cant explain.

so when i said ""love yourself then find the missing puzzle piece needed"" I meant love yourself then find love and be happy as that was a big thing to me to have a family. Then after thinking i wrote before when someone says nobody is perfect what is perfect?depends on who you ask.Also I remember saying it is impossible to know anyones true thoughts before to someone which the video helped. So then i was thinking whats my idea of perfect there is no perfect or if there is the human can only conceive so much that if it were a puzzle it would be so big you could never solve therefor you can only improve there is no perfection so i re made that sentence ""Love yourself and find the missing puzzle pieces needed yourself"" by that i meant my one piece at first was love but thats a small concept now. I looked up spirituality and saw something say there is no sense of a definition which i forgot to mention so i thought its what it means to me unlike a religion that has a label.Just wanted to share that i have found a sense of piece in a long and hard fight within me i also have felt guidance moments often but also im treated with my schizophrenia. Now i will continue to improve and think more clearly for myself.Just wanted to share this as it is important to me.",1606233217.0
spirituality,"Elements, which one do you resonate with most? Which one do you find interesting? What all do you know?","So in many traditions people talk about the elements of fire, earth, water, and air. There is some variation, like in feng shui they add metal, and in other traditions ether. I‚Äôm sure most of us are aware that our zodiac sign has a specific element. Bruce Lee, one of the people that interests me most talks a lot about being like water, being fluid, and being able to adapt to any circumstance. In kundalini we talk about the internal fire, which destroys, purifies, and gives us energy. Air, which is everchanging and free. Earth, which is worshipped many a times in paganism for it is stable and patient and gave us a foundation to live on. So I ask you out of curiosity, which one do you resonate with most and why? What aspects of your personality do you see in that element? What makes it important to you? Or are you one of those people that feels they need to balance those elements?

spirituality,Can animals alert humans telephathically when they are in danger?,"Hi guys, 

Not 100% sure this is the best forum for my query, but thought I'd give it a go! I was just thinking back to the age of 15, when I had a goldfish which I won at the fairground. I'd put him in a shallow bowl of water as that was the main thing I had until I could purchase a proper tank. He sat in that bowl the first night I got him, on my bedside table. I went to sleep around 11pm and I remember suddenly waking around 2-3am that morning, and I recall thinking to myself, 'Something doesn't feel right, I better just check on the fish'. I turned on the light, peered into the bowl and he was gone! Panicking, I looked to the floor and there he was, flapping about on the floor - quite a drop for the poor thing, like a human jumping off a small to medium sized skyscraper in comparison. Luckily, it was carpet so not quite a hard drop. 
I scooped him up as gently as I could and chucked him back into the water. He lay in the water a bit disorientated for a few seconds, shook off a bit of fluff from the carpet and then started swimming around the bowl again as if nothing had happened. He ended up living for nearly 6 years, the longest living goldfish I ever had, and brought me lots of joy and relaxation over the years. 
Looking back, it scares me that I could have not woken until the morning and instead found him dead on the floor. So my question is, is there some communicative way that animals and humans interact, or some kind of telepathic/ energy/ consciousness sharing or transfer that allows us to recognise if they're in danger? 
I just always thought it was peculiar that I just happened to wake and feel compelled to check the fish in that short window of time that he was in danger.

spirituality,Sounds a bit crazy but I fear spiritual/cosmic punishment for something I'm doing. Not sure what the best course of action is,"Hi! I'll just repost here what I put on the relationship sub.

--------------------------------------------------

25-30M: Hate lying to my parents about my casual sexual relationship with a woman who used to work with us as a home health aid, but the alternative is being in an awful emotional state thanks to my mental health issue

I have a weird issue which is basically OCD. My compulsions make it very hard to do what I need to do to get into the dating world, although as stupid as it sounds, they didn't prevent me from making a move on our home health aid (35-40F) via text a year ago, which is much easier for me than in person, and I had no other person as a free option anyways. She might've agreed partially out of pity, although she denied it and said she was enjoying it as well (this was also while she was still working with us so I'd go to her room at night when everyone else was asleep, but she was recently fired for an unrelated reason but we still see each other).

I got the idea when she started complaining about a common physical disadvantage of men in this country (won't go into details). I feel very guilty to tell my parents I don't know anything about her or am not seeing her when they ask, but if I don't have any hookup buddy, my OCD worsens badly. They know we were close and I actually told them last year after an incident in which I told my mom on the phone that I was with a friend (not her), and she got suspicious and saw that I was lying (we were at a love motel), and then the lady was fired but rehired a few weeks afterwards while I was abroad and she said that it was all a misunderstanding and that we weren't sleeping together, and I continued the lie.

I've been making some progress to improve but the nature of the compulsions (mostly avoidance) themselves make it very hard to start moving forward. I've seen psychs about it, but am too paralyzed to make any significant changes. I really hate living a lie but don't want the alternative either, so I'm stuck. If I tell them, it could definitely harm their trust in me and could get kicked out/excommunicated, but my bigger worry is that I'd have to tell my 'girlfriend' too, since the whole point would be to stop lying to people, but then she'd dump me because she's paranoid about my parents and whatnot, which is the last thing I want right now. I know I shouldn't even be with someone who supports dishonesty, but she's all I've got for now. Mental illness definitely doesn't help men have an abundance mentality.

‚Äã

Tl;dr: lying to my parents that I'm not sleeping with, never slept with, see or talk to our ex-home health aid because my OCD makes the alternative much worse, but not sure how to end all the lying without breaking my current relations with everyone, including my 'gf'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I fear some kind of 'bad karma' in the future for lying in my parents' faces about this, because since they obviously wouldn't approve of it and probably tell her and thus break our 'relationship', and the last thing I want is for things to return to the hell they were before, I'm choosing to kept it going, despite the fear that's on my mind every waking moment. Do you have any suggestions, or should I not worry so much about cosmic punishment? It's also worrying that our 'relationship' started around November of last year when the pandemic started (or when the first cases were identified). Guess it's just a coincidence but it seems like too much of one.",1606177732.0

I've been raised in the Bible, but not even as a regular Christian. We don't go to church, we search the Bible ourselves and try to see it for what it is. But. I've had a problem.

So this is the point ‚Äì that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body ... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, ""Please Krishna, you drive the chariot"" because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides ... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield.

spirituality,Your opinions on heaven and hell concepts,"I personally believe that heaven and hell exist, just not in a christian sense, where you can go for eternity, but rather like low and high vibrational places in non physical world. From what I've heard about it, at the time of death a person's psychological state is extremely important. Because in non-physical dimension process of manifestation happens a lot faster and your state of being kind of snowballs rapidly. 

The 'heaven' and 'hell' may be just the state of mind, but due to matching frequency, a soul can go to certain places.

I am also curious about another thing, since creation is so vast and we attract what we believe in, could there be also literal Christian versions of heaven and hell somewhere, and if the soul deeply believes in christian dogma it could literally go there, at least for a while? Think all the varied near death experiences. A lot of them involve a life review, or divine light etc., but there are also experiences that confirm people's view of their religion or some odd, even wacky ones. I think this could be it.

spirituality,Sustain &amp; Flow,"My band recently released an album about the metaphysical concept of Sustain &amp; Flow - we figured that it‚Äôs relevant to this sub so we might as well share it here:

So what is Sustain &amp; Flow?  In our eyes, it‚Äôs one of the most fundamental dualities there is: it‚Äôs about Being balanced with Becoming; Spirit &amp; Consciousness balanced with Nature &amp; Matter; Prana (breath) balanced with Kundalini (vitality).  

In the Samkhya school of Hinduism, this dualism is known as Purusha and Prakriti.

Sustain &amp; Flow also alludes to the Voltage and Current pairing.  For those familiar with electromagnetism, Voltage (the Sustaining) multiplied by Current (the Flowing) yields Power.  Spirit balanced with Matter, Consciousness harmonized with Nature, is thus a Powerful combination.

While it is a simplification, many cultures over the millennia have nonetheless attributed gender to these two forces: the Sustaining force is the male principle; while the dynamic Flowing force is female principle.  This is seen in the Lingam as the active, feminine Shakti force flowing around the neutral phallus of Shiva, the snakes climbing the rod of the Hermetic caduceus, as well as the Ancient Egyptian Djed column (representing the Sustaining force of Osiris‚Äô consciousness) paired with the Tyet (representing the Flowing feminine nature of Isis).

The theme relates to the music itself as well.  The album is a blend of rock, trip-hop, and jazz - the two most prominent instruments on the album are accordingly the electric guitar (Sustain) and the Saxophone (Flow).

Overall, we see it as a good life philosophy: to remain balanced, to achieve harmony between Being and Becoming: Sustain &amp; Flow.

These ideas and much more permeate the record, so please take a listen, it would make our day.  If you were to listen to one song, make it ‚ÄúStream Entry‚Äù or ‚ÄúTiger Dharma.‚Äù  We hope you enjoy!

spirituality,Progress - more inner work needed,"Hi all - I‚Äôve been trying to AP for about a year plus with no exceptional results to share. I meditate 4 or 5 times a week and have been a heavy 420 smoker for awhile. I think cannabis is a great facilitator to spiritual advancement but can only get you so far on your journey. Ive meditating on and off for on the question of cannabis and if it has been negatively affecting my journey.  Also I never meditate while high, only sober. 

For the better part of a year while I‚Äôve been researching and exploring as much as I can, have gotten no signs to change behavior. And I think that had to do with cannabis being a great facilitator to spiritual advancement and opening the mind.  Recently I‚Äôve had synchronicities around the topic and I can‚Äôt avoid the feeling that I‚Äôm at stage where it‚Äôs time to reevaluate and significantly cut back. 

That said, last night after smoking, I was in a daydream state and it kind of hit that I was in an AP and that I have been APing for awhile BUT I don‚Äôt think I am having an AP as we talk about in these discussions. I think cannabis is great for getting to into a lower astral plane but can‚Äôt get you beyond that. Which is where I am stuck. 

One of the books I‚Äôve been readying - The Multidimensional Human by Kurt Leland - is a great resource. I‚Äôve been practicing to feel what plane and what body I‚Äôm in while meditating. With cannabis being such a heavy influence in my life, I feel that I am getting trapped in a lower astral plane. I feel that by drastically cutting cannabis use I can open up and start to explore my other non-physical bodies.

Through it all, We Are Still Here. I have always had a difficult time during these months with less &amp; less warmth as well as sunshine which is needed on a daily basis. Its difficult to find sunshine internally on a day to day basis but its possible through day to day practice.

  
Especially now during these times where we are all locked inside, we have the time to truly focus on ourselves, on our well being. It starts with doing 1 thing a day. 1 thing for ourself, which ultimately with practice will lead to mandatory and necessity for ourselves everyday. 

  
It isn't figured out. I don't have it figured out but the most I can do is try and my best. Lately, I have been journaling ALL my feelings, the ups, the downs, the uglies and everything in between which has allowed me to release the internalization that I have allowed myself to struggle with my whole life. I as well as make sure that I am outside doing something active for at least 30 minutes a day, walking, sitting in nature, being present in the moment and getting away from the digitalized work we are ALL connected to. 

  
Meditation. Daily breathing techniques that allow me to take time for myself and truly breathe and be present. It started with focusing for 30 seconds, then a minute, then 2 minutes, then 3 .....you get where this is going. Remember, when meditating there is no RIGHT Way, but only What is RIGHT for you. Meditation is about maintaining presence, so that could be looking at flowers outside, looking at a tree, watching birds fly, sitting in the field, anything. Anything to maintain presence to allow yourself to enjoy the very moment that we have all been given, together, separately.

  
Today: Give yourself a big ol hug. I mean it. Hug yourself right now. Tight &amp; feel the love we all need for ourselves right now. 

  
As well, go listen to my new podcast I released yesterday; Empathy - Episode 8. Share it wif your pals and family :') 

  
I love you.

spirituality,A sudden shift in my mind and vision. Can anyone help me?,"I asked about this to multiple sources (therapist, psychiatrists), but none gave me a clear answer. So it makes me believe that it‚Äôs spiritually. I was pretty sick around 2011-2012 (I was 15 years old) and was laying on the couch. My mom was at work so I was alone. When I woke up from a nap, I kid you not, I felt a shift happening and I really could feel it in my head and vision. When I  decided to stand up, I noticed that everything seemed different. Even though the colors were the same, it felt different, more grayer. I started to panic and wanted to believe that it would go back to normal. I remembered that this happened earlier again in my life and I thought ‚Äúit happened again and now I need to be able to live like this‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt tell this to anyone when it happened because it was very bizarre and now I‚Äôm thinking that I still live in that state. It‚Äôs like a dream or a frequency change.

You can tell that this is depression and it is, because I can‚Äôt seem to enjoy life and really feel myself, my body. It‚Äôs like my mind is blank or like a numb monkey. Feelings seems also numb. It is some sort of depersonalization. What really helps me is marijuana. I don‚Äôt use it to enjoy things, I do, but it is mostly for understanding myself. It makes me totally here and I‚Äôm being able to think smartly in order. I also know what really matters and I just can‚Äôt apply what I learn after I smoke it. I pray everyday that the shift in me happens again and that‚Äôs why that I hope the shift on 21 december will help me.

spirituality,Fear of seeing spirits awakening,"Hi!! 

Since as long as I can remember I have always been very paranoid and extremely scared of spirits or ghosts or anything of that sort - it's like a phobia and to give you an idea I usually cannot sleep for MONTHS just after hearing one ghost story or watching something. 

I was never too worried about this fear - as long as I kept my distance from anything to do with spirits I was able to forget my fear and live my life normally. 

However recently I have come across some psychics (3) who I haven't sought out but I have bumped into through family gatherings and older friends who tell me that I have intrinsic psychic powers and that I will act as a medium. 

Now, you can probably imagine my TERROR as I imagined something out of the movie the sixth sense happening to me. I'm trying my hardest to be brave and have begun meditating and as much as I try to deny it or brush it off I sometimes just feel things or get flashes in my mind - nothing too concrete, and honestly sometimes I think it's just my imagination - but unfortunately I'm still very very VERY scared of spirits or anything supernatural. 

I feel like maybe I have a purpose??? in sensing spirits and I just feel that it's really important that I get over this fear - I also just want to be a bit less terrified in case i do see or experience something. Can you guys just give me a bit of consolidation about my fear of spirits? I can't really explain my fear it's not even that they'll hurt me it's just like everything inside of me innately rejects the idea of seeing anything - like it's just too scary.

spirituality,Afraid to be disconnected from the source (short question),"I've recently posted a long version of this, just writing a short one in case another one is too much read (although I would appreciate if you do)

I have a bad habit of swearing to God/Universe/Myself on very serious subjects (like my soul, my life, my connection to Source) and then breaking them. I believe I've received warning signs, but stupid me never listens.

My question is, since I believe we create our own reality, how real those 'oaths' are? Do we have to believe in them to be true? Or once you've made an intention you're bound by it and there is no way back?

Is it possible to ever be truly disconnected from the source? I've heard it is, but then again I don't think you can do such thing on a whim.",1606128005.0
spirituality,Afraid to have broken connection to God and Source,"I am here with a serious question regarding esoteric subjects, maybe it will sound stupid idk pardon my ignorance, but I gotta ask.

So, basically I have OCD with scrupulosity themes, which makes me think a lot of anxious thoughts. Sometimes, in desperate attempts to control myself I will make these vows and pledges, like I swear on everything, on my life, my soul, my connection to God (all things I value most) etc. and then stupidly break them. Anxious thoughts may be just thoughts, but these sound like serious intentions. I stupidly keep making those vows even though I know I shouldn't but it's like an addiction, almost.

Recently have been in serious anxiety episode and made and broke a couple of them. Even worse I believe I got signs from the universe to not break them, but my stupid ass either forgets what I swore or just thinks it wasn't serious so its ok to do whatever.

Once I broke such a vow only to break it again, and before I was thinking about doing so, I saw words 'warning, no going back'. Yet I didn't take it seriously. After that I was very anxious once I realized it, and heard a guy outside saying 'game's over', which was a scary coincidence. I prayed and prayed for forgiveness, and when asked for a sign I saw law of attraction quotes, telling me to just believe that I'm free and it will be so.

But right now I am doing my best not to go crazy. Before such things would happen and I would ask God/universe for forgiveness and receive what I believe, signs that it is so. But this time I have broken one of these and it had to do with my connection to God, like if I break it, I will be disconnected from the Source, and its scary af, cause now I am not sure if I can even trust anything anymore, since I may not have the connection to divine. Also I believe I've got a warning sign before.

I believe that we are all coming from the source and that we are God itself and we create our own reality, which should calm me down, except it doesn't. We have free will and I have heard about how it is possible to disconnect from Source, because we have free will and certain beings have done so. On one hand I feel like I am divine and invincible, but on the other I am afraid that permanent spiritual failure is possible and I have commited it.

However I don't feel disconnected (but if I am disconnected, can I even trust my intuitive feelings anymore?) From what I read, if you disconnect from source, you disconnect from love, basically if you do so it's like the Lucifer myth, then such beings would have to sustain themselves entirely on negative energy. Since God is love and I am still capable of love, it seems I should be fine.

If we look at the bible, there is a sin against the Holy Spirit, which I know can be interpreted as our connection to source, about which Jesus says it's the only unpardonable sin. But whatever is the truth, I am afraid I have fucked up, really bad.

I have had OCD for a long time, and have been anxiously obsessing about spiritual stuff, even got serious warning signs from universe recently which I believe were telling me to change my course of thinking, but I didn't. I am afraid over the years of fear and anxiety I have finally manifested my fears into reality and there's no way back. I was warned and didn't listen, multiple times, I'm afraid that even if God wanted to save me, there's no way he can, because I chose my actions with my free will.

So, I would like to hear your take on this. Especially those with esoteric/occult knowledge. My basic questions:

1.Can you break connection to source so easily, or would there need to be very conscious and deliberate intention to turn away from God?

2.Can it be restored?

3. What is an intention exactly, anyway?

4.Can you mess up permanently, or do we have the power to create and save ourselves, no matter the circumstances?

5. If you make an oath, what power does it have on you? Do you have to believe it to be true, or is it more serious?

6. Are the 'signs' coming from the Universe, or is it all just our own manifestation?

spirituality,That indescribable horrible feeling,"Hey gang love and light.

So you know that feeling many of us have been feeing? That terror, depression, sadness or however else you want to describe these feelings coursing through us.

**Stop giving them so much thought and energy**

It‚Äôs not you feeing them, but everybody else and you‚Äôre simply connecting to that. Our jobs in this is to transmute that horrible negativity into positivity however we choose to do that. It can be as simple as finding things to feel happy about despite what your feeling.

If you feel happy despite the pain, and a hundred thousand of you can do that think about the effects it‚Äôll have on everyone else. There is so much trouble in the world that it‚Äôs overflowing and we‚Äôre being left to pick up the pieces. Before any of you think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs unfair‚Äù just remember who chose this life you‚Äôre living.

I keep seeing people scared and lost as a result of these feelings and frankly you need to be stronger than that. This is nothing compared to what‚Äôs coming and all of us need to pull through together. If you can‚Äôt help yourself find happiness through this then you‚Äôre not going to be strong enough to help anyone else either.

I know this might not be the kind and easy ‚Äúeverything is ok don‚Äôt worry‚Äù you want to hear but everything is not currently ok, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve got to fix. You don‚Äôt have to help anyone else, but if you‚Äôve chosen the path of spirituality then it‚Äôs your responsibility to. Again, remember who it was that chose the life you‚Äôre living. 

Best of luck to you all and for the love of God don‚Äôt sink into these horrible feelings, because it‚Äôs not going to be just you who suffers as a result. We are all strong enough to cope and move through this, it‚Äôs time everyone truly accepted that. Love and Light.",1606124296.0
spirituality,What‚Äôs YOUR PHILOSOPHY,"I‚Äôve been off the path for too long. Found it through the brush and then took a seat for a bit to gather my thoughts. I thought it would be harder but it‚Äôs not. Everything‚Äôs easy if you try hard. I‚Äôve just stumbled across solipsism and axioms as I was spiraling down a bad hole tonight but consciously pulled myself out but wanting to be better wondering what‚Äôs wrong with me and then realizing I‚Äôm just skeptical as shit and are more curious that‚Äôs me and I‚Äôm great. Gotta have that spark  take it. Create it. But always gift it again. Axioms Weird word. I googled the definition and many doors opened with little thought. Got me thinking what I can do what a lot of thought and almost surgical approach to anything I decide to do. Forgive me for rambling. 

But enough about me. What‚Äôs your philosophical insight. What do you choose to believe in even if it‚Äôs nothing. Have you created your own laws from everything you‚Äôve studied. Have you followed a single path or created your own using the previous wisdom passed down? Did that first paragraph make you question anything? I like the thought of one. It makes me feel at home but I love being free. Do you choose what‚Äôs best for you to be able to survive in our current system or do you pursue your own true bliss even if it means being isolated and drifting further from your ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and what you thought was you. Damn. Who is you. Is it us me he or she. Maybe   Maybe not. Maybe we‚Äôre real maybe it‚Äôs a farce. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre just supposed to be. In the moment with our 6 senses. And nothing else to distract us. Maybe we all get distracted to rakishly and our mission is to learn true focus. True drive. True passion? But that‚Äôs differed for everyone. Damn guys and gals it‚Äôs been a long strange trip already and I fear and am grateful that‚Äôs it‚Äôs nowhere near over. ;)

spirituality,The observer is the universe observing itself,"Many people tend to think that they are something separate from the universe. But we are the universe.

Because of their thoughts! But where did these thoughts come from? Exactly! From nothing. Like everything comes from nothing (or from the big everything, it depends on how you want to call it). So let's take these thoughts away. What's left? Something almost exactly the same as a stone, drop of water, leaf, etc... What are these things made of? Of things that come from the earth. You eat and drink the food and drinks of the earth. And that's why you are made out of the earth. In the same way as a tree is made out of the earth. The exact same applies for the earth in connection with the universe. We do not come into this world, we come out of it.. And when you die your physical body like you used to know it will be gone. But nothing really dies. It is like a cloud. When the cloud disappears. You can say the cloud is dead. But the cloud has turned into water. The same will happen to you. Everything is one.

I was thinking about it later in the day and then all of a sudden I had the strangest feeling, as if I could traverse realities at my own will.

spirituality,Who am I?," 

All efforts, practices, desires, problems, obstacles are just ideas that have this sticky sense of ""I"". We use our ""I"" milion times in a day in a very untrue manner and that is why we suffer. We believe that we are some character that has to do all kinds of silly things and suffer in this world, but thats a total dream. You can wake up from this dream, very easily. Dont curse suffering and pain, its a gift actually. Its a beautiful indicator that something is not right. What is it? Its just the way you use your ""I"". If you combine your ""I"" with something that is not true, thats when trouble arises. Its the only cause of all problems. For instance we say- I am sad/I am mad/I am angry/I am this person, with this name, history, backround/I want to achieve something in life/I dont want to be here... ect. Can you see this ""I"" behind all of it? Is this ""I"" that is combined with all sorts of ideas true? Can you be a mere idea?

You are the center of your experience, but if you do not investigate what this You actually Is, than there is no way you can live without constantly striving for something that doesn't actually exist. What you are striving for is your nature. You are looking for yourself. Don¬¥t underestimate/overlook this understanding. To understand your self is the most most important thing in life. What can be more important? What kind of life is it, when we dont know what we are?

Who am I than?

Can you see that when you say I, there is a deeper space in which this ""I"" thought appears? See that all thoughts are equally appearing in this space. Are you this space or the thoughts? Obviously the space, isn't it? This ""space"" is not really a space, but its a very close description of it. Look in your experience. It truly is indescribable. We can give it milion names- Consciousnesss, Awareness, Isness, Brahman, God, but thats not the point. The point of theese concepts is just to show to that which is not a concept. That pure limitless Being that we all share. How beautiful.

After reading this your mind can and will actually come with milions of excuses and ways to distract you from this truth, it will literally try everything, everything it can. But if you dont combine yourself with the mind- If you dont say: ""this is happening to me""/""why theese mind atacks""/""i dont want this mind""/""I am lost""/, than you can actually notice that you are just witnessing this play of mind and it says nothing about you. The mind can actually even come with this sence of ""being a spiritual achiever"" and pretend that you are fully enlightened, while still unconsciously identifying with concepts. (happened to me, so i know that state of self delusion pretty well, haha) The best is just to keep marinating in the truth without purchasing any concepts. Keep vigilant- not by force, but by pure interest only in the truth. Surely ideas will come and go, but you are not holding unto them and thats very important. You dont need them anymore, because you know that its just a waste of time. The only not waste of time is to be in the timeless zone. Thats the untouchable unchanging presence that we are.

So shortly. Just discover that all concepts come and go and if you are not giving them your sence of ""me"" than they cant do anything at all, because they are not you (same with emotions and all appearances). Notice that everything appears in you, but you cannot appear/dissapear. You are always here, one with all.

Much love. Thank you.",1606078159.0
spirituality,How To Practice Zen In Daily Life,"I've recently been getting into Zen habits and I've found it extremely useful. I made a video if you want too watch it [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyMQiQXormw&amp;t=18s&amp;ab_channel=Eternalised-Philosophy). This is a short introduction to Zen.

Zen is a form of Buddhism. In the West ‚Äì Buddhism is often ascribed to two main schools: **Mahayana** literally the ‚ÄúGreat Vehicle‚Äù, which Zen is a part of and is prominent in East Asia, therefore also referred to as Eastern Buddhism, alongside **Theravada** literally the ‚ÄúTeaching of the Elders‚Äù, prominent in Southeast Asia. Some scholars also include **Vajrayana**, a kind of Esoteric Buddhism as a third school, practiced in the Northern Himalayan region, among other places.

Zen originated in China, when Buddhism spread from India to China ‚Äì and was strongly influenced by Taoist philosophy. It then spread all over Asia in countries such as Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. Today it is practiced all around the world.

Zen literally means ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù. Zazen or ‚Äúseated meditation‚Äù is the primary practice of the Zen Buddhist tradition. It is a means of insight into the nature of existence, that is, the nature of the mind and of things. This insight is expressed personally in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. Unlike religion, Zen does not mention God, it does not try to explain how the world was created and what happens after death.

A Zen koan is a paradoxical anecdote or riddle without a solution, used to create doubt and demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning to test a student‚Äôs progress in Zen.

A famous one is: *If you meet the Buddha, kill him.* 

What we can make out of this, is perhaps that we have to kill our ideas: whether it be god, becoming rich, to end suffering ‚Äì we have to break open from our conceptual framework that keeps us trapped from our own creations, and be open to what actually is. What we are all searching for is right inside of us, not in the sky or somewhere else.

Buddhism has at its base these things called sutras, which are the teachings of the Buddha. Although Zen   uses them, it really emphasises much more one‚Äôs own experience, which is the way to discover the truth of the Buddhist teaching. Not through intellectual understanding and study, but through one‚Äôs actual experience. As such, it is less of a theoretical philosophy and more of a way of life and personal spiritual practice.

Zen highlights meditation as a way of experiencing basic reality. Sitting quietly, going deep  and asking the question: What am I? That is the fundamental question in Zen. It begins with the curiosity and wonder of who you are. 

If we take a look at our modern society, people can seem quite inauthentic, a lot of posturing or creating personas, concealing our true self and presenting ourselves as someone different to who we really are, in order to impress other people. This forms a shadow as psychoanalyst Carl Jung puts it, where all of our repressed emotions and negative traits are stored ‚Äì we then behave like a passive victim of our shadow, which slowly takes control of our personality and of our actions. 

Zen tells us to stop for a moment. To think about what we are doing with our life. To begin to wonder, who are you? What are you really? Not what your parents wanted you to be, not what society wants you to be, but what is the truth? Who are you really? And what kind of life makes sense for you? Not what people tell you to do, but for you, what is your truth?

Simple meditation allows us to go deeper into our reality and see things more clearly. Most of us, if not all of us, are bound to our conceptual thinking. We get stuck in the commentary of things. We ruminate, we overthink, there is an ongoing mental chatter going on. As the Taoists would say:

‚ÄúEmpty yourself of everything. Let the mind become still.‚Äù

While meditating, we see a lot of things, a lot commentary, and opinions. Or we can also feel a sense of peace and calm. There is the feeling of this calmness, and then there‚Äôs the commentary of the feeling of this calmness. Two very separate things.

Zen tries to bring us in to the experience itself. What are you thinking? What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you taste? ‚Äì By asking these questions we get closer to the experience, closer to our true experience.

When we meditate, we tend to drift away from this and get lost in the commentary: the problems you‚Äôve had at work, what you have to do next. We live our life thinking of the future (of what we think is to come) and the past (what has already happened). 

In Zen you might hear shouts and hits, this is not some sort of torture, the point of this is to come back to this moment. 

It is incredibly easy to drift away to our thoughts. Zen orients us to come back in order to search for the fundamental question: What am I?

Have a clear mind. The way we can return to this moment is to say: I don‚Äôt know. It means to let go of one‚Äôs certainty, we are so afraid of not knowing that we construct fantasies of what things are so we can feel comfort in our knowing.

Zen teaches us to get some comfort in not knowing. If you can be comfortable enough in not knowing, then you have the stability to be present with some curiosity and wonder.

We all have problems; we all struggle in our lives ‚Äì that‚Äôs the human condition. Our desire is to solve our problems so that we can be happier. The problem is that we are stuck in our own conceptual thinking, it may happen that the more we try to solve a problem, the worse it gets ‚Äì or that when we do solve a problem, another problem pops up.

In Zen we expand our thinking, and if we listen closely enough ‚Äì the answer is right there. But if we are stuck in our ideas and belief system, we often can‚Äôt find it.

Be present and see what is happening, not your fantasy about what is happening but seeing what‚Äôs actually happening and then responding. That in a nutshell, is Zen practice, and Zen life. To be present, to hear what‚Äôs being spoken and to hear it, clearly. 

Our life is built around making assumptions, but often times when you talk to someone ‚Äì you aren‚Äôt talking about the same thing. What you meant about something is not what the other person is thinking you meant ‚Äì in many ways, that‚Äôs what we do with our lives, we make assumptions, our consciousness is built in such a way to make assumptions, we‚Äôre making approximations all the time.

One of the most important practices is to learn when you are making wrong assumptions, without getting defensive but rather acknowledging it. Then you can start to listen more closely, to be in the moment and find out what‚Äôs actually going on. 

The simple practice of sitting down, closing your eyes, breathing slowly in (What am I?), breathing slowly out (don‚Äôt know), trains us to be present.

Zen meditation brings our attention down to our lower abdomen, it is diaphragmatic breathing. In the inhalation, your belly expands out, and on the exhalation, it falls. 

*‚ÄúTo study Buddhism is to study yourself. To study yourself is to forget yourself.‚Äù*

\- Zen Master D≈çgen

The point of Zen is not to master Buddhist teachings, but to realise who you really are ‚Äì and in order to realise this, you must let go of yourself.

Zen teaches us that to let go of ourselves, we need to realise that the self and the external world are not two different realms, but rather one. The evaporation of this separation allows a natural state of compassion and wisdom, in which our life flows through. 

So be immersed in this moment, not in the future and not in the past ‚Äì be aware and alive right now.",1606077109.0

spirituality,Go against it and you will suffer even more,"There are a lot of people who are fighting against that one great power of life, and they will just get tired because they belong to that great power of life. For example trying to get rid of all the negativity in life. If you would try to do that you will for sure end up very tired, and probably with even more negativity than before. A way to explain this is by using a wave as an example. In this example the wave is the big power of life, and we are all drops. You as a drop can fight against the direction of the wave, but since you are part of the wave you will always go with the wave. So I would recommend to not fight against the great power of life. You will only get tired.

spirituality,Its a beautiful thing to feel your healing,"My spiritual journey that started this April has been an experience of ebbs and flows from highly healing moments, to deeply confusing and conflicting lows. It is the inevitable process of awakening.

After recently coming out of almost a month long confusing and conflicting low which felt like a major setback, these last two weeks have been an amazing build up full of extremely transformational, cellular level energetic upgrades.

I can feel the healing happening in my body. It is incredible. I am physically and energetically as light as a feather. With intentional focus, within seconds I can activate high vibrations throughout my entire being. My hands light up and I have a knowing they are meant to heal.

After a lot of self-acceptance, acceptance of my childhood and acceptance of where I am in life today, I can feel that this healing is finally letting go of past hurts, energies I've held on to that weigh me down, and releasing doubt and fear.

I'm learning to love myself, and listen to myself even more.

Don't let the dark moments pass you by. Sit in them. Be with them. Accept them.

spirituality,The past Is the womb Of current thoughts Always delivered Stillborn To actuality,"I've been thinking a lot about thoughts.

How we cannot choose our current thoughts, which arise as sense perceptions, but how we can influence the content and tone of future thoughts by curating our experiences and exposures. This is especially true in how we allow language to shape our inner and outer worlds.

Words...spelling...spells; work to magically input voices, concepts and frameworks into our minds as thoughts that we then mistake for our own. It may be the voice of a parent, a teacher or yet another regurgitation of the persistent self critical monologue we've been perfecting since childhood. But it is not us. 

These echoes of past judgement infiltrate the now moment fertilized by stagnant preconception formatting our binary, computational minds into tools of discrimination as result of the catagorizing and qualifying of experiences. 

As such all thoughts become projected ghosts of symbolic apprehension, simple delusions which only cloud the knowing of existence.

spirituality,My Spiritual Experience,"My entire life I have believed there is a higher source.  I just never understood where it came from.  I attended churches to search for this feeling.

My core beliefs and how I reflect myself to others.  The thing about this experience is that you need to be completely aware of oneself and others.  Learning to focus when others speak and giving eye contact seem like simple skills but if they are done on a spiritual level they are much deeper.

I have realized now I cannot live any other way.  The peace I feel does not come from any church or any book on values.  It comes from me more than anyone or anything.  And if that cannot be my guide then I am lost...  This takes constant practice on my part as I still have many deficits being a human.

spirituality,HeartBreak Lover (41),"Heartbreak. Realignment. Feeling all the feels. Numbing. Subconscious. Focused Passion.

  
In the past year and a half my life has been the most unexpected events possible &amp; I am grateful for it all. 

    
It started 2 springs ago where I met someone through social media that made me stop and think like, wait........who are you? Where did you come from? Your energy is so pure. Friendship and helping each other out with our passion projects which lead to organic feelings. When together, the feelings of being on another planet together and when apart, returning to Earth. These feelings from start to finish were quick lived and by the middle of the summer it was all over. Unexpected. For the first time in more than 5 years I had felt feelings for someone so strong that there were no other thought in mind &amp; then, nothing. All of a sudden.

  
I was shattered, broken, lost. How did I go from focusing on my passions everyday to then still focusing on my passions but being broken. From that time until 6 months ago, I was numb. I self induced myself with Alcohol Daily. Marijuana Daily, with both becoming a necessity. Still, I was focused. Focused on my passions and what fuelled me from day to day. Heartbreak, let me tell you wasn't expected. It was something that came out of left field but was meant for my process and journey. It allowed me to go through all of the feelings, as well as none at all in the same moment, due to my numbing, to now being healed with those feelings and being one with myself. 

  
Putting love into myself everyday, spending time with myself and releasing the need to be around people all the time. As well as needing the fulfillment from others, I am healing. Its a practice day to day that I am still learning on how to be more present with myself and for the special ones around me. 

  
Going through heartbreak has no ""right"" way to heal from. It was doing what was best for me, which will be different from yours. I am here for you. I am here to listen. 

  
I love you.

You suffer psychologically because you are thinking. Because you have thoughts that come from your memory. Without all that you would just be observing with no sense of the self. You are the observer. When there is only observing you cannot be hurt. So the way not to suffer is to let go of everything more than the observing. Of course this can be very difficult. But as soon as you will be able to see the difference between observing and everything more than observing. You will already be able to suffer less.

spirituality,üí´ Looking beyond the Veil üí´,"üí´ **Looking beyond the Veil** üí´

If the sources mentioned below can be trusted, it means nothing less, then that humanity is in the process of finally liberating itself (with the help from above and below) from the agelong oppression by the dark overlords. But this game is so much bigger one could ever imagine:

We are currently experiencing the end of an intergalactic/interdimensional war between Light and Dark, that has lasted for millions of years, with Earth being the last occupied planet under the control of the dark forces and the victory of Light being inevitable... Sounds incredible? It is!

&amp;#x200B;

üí´ Some background information:

Through the interaction of free will with the Primary Anomaly, which is the polar opposite (yet part of) Source, Darkness emerged long ago, when the first beings began to turn away from the Light, disregarding the law of unity and enriching themselves at the expense of others.                       

\[Lucifer played a crucial part in this fall from grace, but is actually not to blame, because he merely made this experience possible and took sheer infinite pain onto himself in the process.\]

At first, this development was tolerated, but that so much suffering would ever result from it, was never in the spirit of Source. In this Experiment of Duality with it's 3rd Density Consciousness, it was the first time souls were able to experience the uttermost disconnection from Source and therefore create immesurable ammounts of suffering for themselves and others. This was the darkest it could ever get ‚Äì and we were right in the middle of it..

This means, the belief that suffering is inevitably part of existence is a misconception, that stems from our twisted and limited worldview through Matrix programming: our true state of being is pure peace and unconditional love!

\[There are other self-aware species currently living in 3D consciousness, but in a free universe they can actually evolve past the illusion of seperation quite easily and experience no where near as much unnecessary and cruel suffering as humans had to endure here on earth.\]

So, with the dark parasitic consciousness on the rise, millions if not billions of years ago, the dark entities we call Archons \[greek: ruler, see gnosis\], have set out to subjugate the universe and have occupied and enslaved many star systems and planets. Among them is our beautiful Mother Earth, which they conquered about 26.000 years ago. In response to the threat oft he Dark, the beings of Light had to arm up themselves and so the most advanced star nations founded the Galactic Confederation to stop the expansion of Dark and utlimately end it once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

üí´ The bitter reality up until now:

Since then, mankind has been controlled, oppressed and exploited from the shadows (other planes of existence, mainly the 4th density mental planes) by the Archons and their Minions, the Draco and Reptilians\*:

Our natural connection to higher levels of consciousness and ultimately to Source has been cut off by a matrix of energetic barriers and etheric implants, energetic attacks, psychological warfare and manipulation.

Through the installation of patriarchal religions, the image of a punishing God, the suppression of our true history of origin (many of us are litteral starseeds, that came here with one mission: to transmute duality from within by raising consciousness to liberate humanity), suppression of the divine feminine, sexuality and spirituality, suppression of (metaphysical) science and holistic medicine by maintaining a materialistic-deterministic world view and a school-medicine that often does more harm than it offers healing. Through the poisoning of our food, our drinking water, the atmosphere and the perversion of art and media... the list is endless! Not a single important aspect of our lives has been left out!

Virtually everything has been corrupted by these parasites and used to our detriment. They have deliberately kept us in a vicious cycle of trauma and suffering and have sown disaster wherever they can, feeding on our fear and the low vibrational energies that all the suffering generates.

They have removed themselves so far from source, that they depend on the life energy of other beings for survival! And so they created this malicious system - a prison of suffering, invisible to the inmates - where they could feast on the prisoners without them noticing. In this way, they subdued many solar systems and space-races and perfected their cruel technologies over millions of years.

This is the reason why our world is ruled by tyrants and psychopaths, the reason why there is so much injustice and for many here is hell on earth. No species would ever destroy itself on its own initiative in such a dumb way, that simply contradicts the laws of the evolution of consciousness.

We would have long been ready to travel the universe in peace and harmony as one species (like all other races in the free universe do). But our governments are controlled by the Deepstate, which in turn is controlled by the black aristocracy, where the Archons incarnated and ruled, which are the origin of our misery in the first place. Humanity has been oppressed and poisoned, raped and traumatized, and their souls have been caught in the endless wheel of karma and rebirth. 

We were merely Batteries, conditioned to believe in the false freedom of our prison-reality. 

This is what our sad reality has looked like so far...

Ofcourse throughout history, there have been repeated attempts by the lightforces to free humanity from within this prison (Jesus, Buddha, Hermes Trismegisto, St. Germain and many others). But even if these beings brought much wisdom and light to the earth and illuminated it sustainably, the Matrix was simply too strong for mankind to free itself...

&amp;#x200B;

üí´ But now the time of change has finally come!

Since the 1970s, the Galactic Federation (they already reside in our solar system with millions of ships!) has been working with the Resistance Movement on Earth and the people of Argata/Inner Earth (who fled there after the fall of Atlantis and the first Archon invasion) to free humanity once and for all!

Problem: Humanity is held hostage by the dark. This means that if the forces of light would physically intervene here on earth, complete chaos would ensue and the dark forces would destroy everything with their exoctic weapon technologies before humanity could be saved. \[For example, Strangelet- and Topletbombs are quantum mechanical bombs, that can tear apart whole solar systems if not contained.\] Too many would lose their lives.. Therefore, unbelievably skilled and careful action must be taken. The dark rulers are fighting back - as you can see - and are now using their last resources to install their NWO and force humanity into ultimate submission to keep their power.

But they are checkmate and the upper ones already know it! The victory of light is inevitable and already visible from the higher planes! 

All positive timelines have been secured, all drastically negative ones have been resolved. Every day more and more people become awake, the matrix is continuously being dismantled and the light here on earth is increasing steadily. However, the dark ones are not willing to surrender and continue with their evil agenda. Therefore, the situation for us on earth is now becoming more and more instable and intense until everything discharges at once:

&amp;#x200B;

üí´ **The Event!** üí´

Once the Matrix/the old system has collapsed and the dark ones are disempowered and disarmed enough for the Lightforces to intervene, the cabal/deepstate will be arrested and held accountable for all their actions. Everything is prepared:

The financial system will be reset and replaced by a fair one. The media will be liberated and report the truth again! All suppressed inventions and technologies are going to be released. The veil of illusions will fall and we will be finally free!

With this cosmic event - the timing of which cannot be predicted,  but which (in my opinion and in the opinion of many others) is very likely to happen within the next 6 months - a wave of love and light from the Galactic Central Sun will hit the Earth, dissolving the last remnants of the Primary Anomaly and illuminating the entire planet, which will be clearly felt by many. The Matrix will finally collapse and there will be a collective sigh of relief. Nevertheless, it will also be a shock for many, because not everyone will have woken up by then - the matrix programming still sits too deep.

A lot of healing will be necessary, but the worst will be over. All humans will finally be able to live in peace, freedom and abundance!

\[There will be ofcourse still attemps to highjack the situation because not everybody will suddenly be able to let go of their 3D mentality, but the critical mass will have reached a point where they know that only together we can strive and act incresingly only in alignment with the higher good. So all remaining shadows will slowly but surely be integrated and no new ones will be created, since the source of darkness will be gone for good.\]

Not long after the Event, the Resistance Movement will make itself public and the first official physical contacts with our starry brothers and sisters will be made and nothing will stand in the way anymore of our returning home to the higher planes of existence. Gaia will be ascending into the 5th density of unity consciousness and everyone, who is willing to step fully into the light is going with her. The new golden Age of Aquarius is dawning‚Ä¶

Since Earth is the last planet under the reign of the Dark in our universe, the liberation of this planet and the total removal of the Primary Anomaly will also mark the final victory of Light for this entire universe! When the last beings have ascended back into the 5th Dimension and above (which will happen some time after the Event), Source will have reached a new state of perfection.

Now imagine this: 5D unity consciousness is litteral paradise - but it‚Äòs still only just the beginning (or rather the continuation) of our journey..

Since there are many many Sources birthing different universes continuously experiencing themselves as fractal part of the One in eternity, luckily there is still much to look forward for us..  üòã 

Thank you all for reading!

Victory of the Light!

spirituality,I keep slipping into Existential Crisis mode at the end of every day... How do I cope with waking up to truth,"I keep making progress in many different areas of my external world and especially my internal world but I find myself slipping into existential crisis mode at the end of every day... it‚Äôs really strange. I will go all day and have various realizations about life in general or myself and why I am the way I am or do the things I do and what I personally would like to work on which could then benefit myself and in the end all of us for the greater good considering the idea of universal consciousness and what not... but see then I go back to remembering what it felt like when I felt the ‚Äúoneness‚Äù (for lack of a better term) of Everyone and everything and that‚Äôs when the existential crisis begins lol. I begin spiraling all over again because I‚Äôm struggling to wrap my head around the idea of living in this ‚Äúdivine matrix‚Äù and just being okay with it? Because part of me keeps wondering.... is it divine? Am I divine? Is anything I think I know or believe real at all? My perception was crushed and forced to be altered forever when I woke up the first time around so who is to say that won‚Äôt happen again? Are all these other humans actually experiencing life or are they just part of my imagination? Are we ALL ONE or am I ALONE ? Like it‚Äôs 1am right now and here I am struggling to sleep because I was cuddling up with my husband and then I began questioning if he was even real and I shut my eyes and began looking with my mind‚Äôs eye in a way... if that makes sense... and all I saw were shapes and fractals in this darkness so I opened them and they remained in my vision just combined with everything else in my line of view in my bedroom. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane sometimes and I really hope there‚Äôs someone out there who can help me better understand the bigger picture of things or at least ease my mind... or even if there‚Äôs anyone who somehow relates to this. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve hopped on Reddit but I need some support right now :( I wish I knew how to cope with these bouts of whatever you wanna call this... it‚Äôs just very scary and I become extremely anxious, unsettled, and out of touch with reality around me for too long and it becomes harder and harder to ground myself the longer I float here in this bubble of existential crisis lol plsss someone help! Also for some context as to why these thoughts comes with so much fear is because I‚Äôm always scared that the more I learn my truth the sooner I‚Äôm gonna die?? I had a near death experience back in September and I saw a lot.... I keep feeling like I know too much to remain in this reality but my gut tells me that‚Äôs not true? It‚Äôs like my mind is trying to scare me away from learning my truth but my higher self is like leaving breadcrumbs for me to find my way back home but that‚Äôs the thing... idk what home is ! And if home means death I realized back in September that I‚Äôm notttt ready for that! This is coming from someone who had been suicidal for YEARS. After my experience and time in the hospital I came out believing in a higher power with no doubt in my mind and all these outlooks about various things that had changed and it‚Äôs like I became a whole new person. Reborn or something. Idk... but yeah so the crisis stems from fear of nothing being real mixed with the realization that I could die at any moment and idk what that even means because I was supposed to die in that experience in September but I lived and the fear of losing everything I have all over again is horrifying. I realized how lucky I am to have the body/vessel I have and love the people I love and have the talents I have... I realized how beautiful life is and how everyone fails to realize that the human experience IS ‚Äúheaven.‚Äù It‚Äôs up to us to decide whether we make it our own heaven or hell but still, this is what it‚Äôs all about. We come here to learn and create and to LOVE. It‚Äôs beautiful! I‚Äôm just scared to lose it right now and the existential crisis never helps ease my anxiety. I just wish I knew if I could go further down this path without literally dying from knowing too much.. idk if that sounds insane or If like  all of this does but yeah... for some reason that Is my biggest fear rn. Fear of death and life? Fear of the unknown which is kind of everything when u dig deep... how do I cope with this lmao",1606027837.0
spirituality,Am I the only one seeing issues with a pre destined afterlife?,"I'm a neutral person when it comes to the afterlife.

Well as long as you aren't a negative pos then it seems like your soul is destroyed or you go to a negative afterlife for awhile.

But if you were rather positive in life, you end up doing the same thing endlessly, for all eternity. And in pagan religions with your ancestors doing the same thing for all eternity. Or with your loved ones, for all eternity. Or worshipping a god, which you shouldn't have to do, for all eternity.

OR you are at endless loop of reincarnations for all eternity.

Either way it's broken

1.) Doing the same thing endlessly for eternity is torture. Also what if you don't want to be with your ancestors? Or don't like your birth family and want to be with the family you actually like as well as your loved ones? Or what if you were trans in life and hated your body and now you're stuck in that body for all eternity.

One person's heaven can be another person's hell.

What if the person was gothic and feels comforted by the dark, and paradise is all lovey dovey, white, pearly gates, with no rock music to be heard but instead harps. Well congratz you made that person hate the afterlife

Etc.

2.) And if you constantly being reincarnated after death, that again is hell. Because you won't remember anything from your past life. What you liked, loved, who you were, who you loved, making your past life meaningless. And always in a state of losing yourself.

And if the goal is to become a god eventually like in Hinduism, you still are being continuously reincarnated losing yourself and the ones you love.

So it's still hell.

Something is wrong here

Tbh I would rather just create my own version of paradise, die and never exist again, or die and learn in the astral to become a god so i could create my own universe without losing myself continuously and also losing and forgetting the ones I loved.",1606026905.0
spirituality,Reflections on the Practice of Meditation on the Winter Solstice,"The experience of being ‚Äúblissed-out‚Äù while in the deepest states of meditation is not so unusual.  This particular subjective impression can be explained away by scientific jargon, such as ‚Äúhemispheric synchronization,‚Äù ‚Äútheta state,‚Äù or even ‚Äúneural entrainment.‚Äù  Rationalizations are irrelevant. The meditator simply **knows** that something significant and transformative occurs ‚Äì It‚Äôs very real.

Winter solstice meditations, especially those on a planetary scale, are hyper transformative.  They are near-mystical celebrations. It is akin to arriving at a class reunion. Inexplicably, every best friend you‚Äôve ever had ‚Äì They are there too. They all want to communicate with you, simultaneously.  You embrace everybody and later, hold hands.  Eyes are closed.  In utter amazement,  the group feels the essence of classmates who have passed on as well.  There you are, together.  Then, the big finale.  Intense, palpable colors permeate your spirit.  You‚Äôve made contact with something so colossal, so stupendous, that it‚Äôs necessary to question that it could even be so.  Whether we are ‚Äúfractals of the universe‚Äù or not,  I feel safe in saying that something very extraordinary and rare happens during these magnificent astronomical events.

 Something **beyond rare** is about to occur.  I can‚Äôt help but to be in awe of the remarkable December that we are about to have. A Jupiter-Saturn great conjunction will happen, on the same day as the solstice!  According to the ‚ÄúWe Love Mass Meditation‚Äù Facebook page, that‚Äôs not all. A Pluto-Eris square is happening on December 10th.  A total solar eclipse is happening on December 14th.  Saturn will enter Aquarius on December 17th.   Jupiter will enter Aquarius on December 19th. Regarding the totality of the alignments on December 21st, it‚Äôs the first time that this will have occurred since 1405!  As a not-even-amateur astrologist, I can‚Äôt miss this opportunity!  This is what is referred to as ‚ÄúThe Age of Aquarius.‚Äù  If your interest has been piqued, a large-scale meditation has been arranged to celebrate this grand occasion.

We will be doing our Age of Aquarius meditation at the exact moment of the Jupiter ‚Äì Saturn conjunction, on December 21st, which will be at 6:22 pm UTC.  The equals 10:22 am PST in Los Angeles, 11:22 am AST in Denver, 12:22 pm CST in Chicago, 1:22 pm EST in New York, 6:22 pm GMT in London, 7:22 pm CET in Paris, 8:22 pm EET in Cairo, 2:22 am CST on Tuesday, December 22nd in Taipei and Beijing, 3:22 am JST on December 22nd, in Tokyo, and 5:22 am AEDT on December 22nd in Sydney.    

If you wish, you may use this procedure while meditating:

1.  Relax

2.  Intend that the meditation will trigger the Age of Aquarius.

3.  Ask the violet flame to protect you before, during, and after the event.

4.  Imagine white light traveling from the cosmic central sun, then being distributed to central suns of all galaxies. The light will travel through the M87 galaxy, enter through the galactic central sun, then going through our galaxy, then entering our solar system and going through our solar system, then through sub lunar space, and then through all beings on earth, and finally, through your body to the center of our planet.

5.  Visualize the light transmuting all remaining darkness on earth.  See soft, pink light bathing all beings on planet earth, and healing them.  Visualize the Age of Aquarius beginning, bringing pure light, love and happiness.  Visualize your perfect life.

spirituality,Crafting our minds,"&amp;#x200B;

Found the below video to be a very good introduction to the topic of Mind and making progress in life by learning to craft our minds

[https://youtu.be/Spn3bbI6PDw](https://youtu.be/Spn3bbI6PDw)

As long as the mind exists, there will be duality and meditation cannot be a escape route . As kids we used to indulge in playfights, however with time we have lost that ability and take things seriously.

The points of learning to deal with uncertainty and inevitability are spot on. Our minds are in a constant state of planning and expectation and life does not play by our rules.

One will have to develop skills to live life in a productive manner while developing mindfulness. The practices of pranayama and meditation can help increase mindfulness.

spirituality,Duality can be beautiful,"Being aware of the fact that this universe is a dualistic universe can give you a life full of
joy.

You know up because of down.
You know light because of dark.
You know left because of right.
You know something because of nothing.

In that exact same way you know positivity because of negativity. So face everything in
your life. Do not look away from the negativity. Everything in life can be useful, and
beautiful in some way or other.
Note; If you feel sad when you are facing the negativity, then don't forget that there is
nothing wrong with feeling sad. Since birth we hear sentences like ¬®I want you to be
happy.¬® Very lovely sentences, but also thanks to these sentences people start to feel
even more sad when they feel sad because they get a feeling of failure. So don't feel sad
about having a sad feeling. There is nothing wrong with feeling sad. Remember, you
know positivity because of negativity.

spirituality,Suggestions for guided deep/trance meditation,"I typically do my mediation unguided with good results. Last night I practiced a different type of meditation where I layed down and focused on relaxing each body part to the max. Then I'd move my attention or consciousness to the parts of my body I could feel interacting with the floor beneath, the pressure points of my weight if you will. I'd continue to just sense exactly what it was my hand was sensing by its weight on the floor. Knowing how atoms work and knowing that I'm not truly touching anything, only interacting with a wavelength, I attempted to change my wavelength to no longer oppose the wavelength of the object (in this case the floor). In doing so at points I would feel the need to move that hand to feel some type of input, if I could move through that I'd notice a numb type of feeling to my hands, like a senseless feeling but full of energy. I didn't feel the floor. I felt radiant energy only. I believe that if I could focus my entire body like this my entire body could change wavelengths and from there possibly out of body experience, consciousness dimensional shift, or knowledge downloads such as psychedelics can give you. I'm not sure but I'm sure there's something to learn there.

spirituality,"Walking someone into the light, just another day.","I have had experiences like this most of my life, and practice spiritual communion almost daily. But this one is one of those that are memorable.

I worked in care most of this year up until I had a bad health flare-up. I knew the residents at my old nursing home very well.

My old nursing home had a man. He was in his early 60s and had suffered a catastrophic stroke, and was bedbound, left unable to speak, half paralyzed.

I remember he was very difficult to change and would wet his pad in his bed and it was degrading. He could answer yes/no in a jumbled way.

I sat with him one day, and asked him if he believed in anything. He mined 'no'. He was an atheist. I explained about some experiences, and on some level left it known that if he needed aid, call for it.

Fast forward to last night, months after I left. A VIVID dream. I had a dream that I walked into his room at the nursing home. I was reassuring him. But not with words, it was with communication that goes beyond that. Beyond words. I can't describe it. I have had this with my mother (who had passed away from a ruptured aneurysm in 2013), and some other spirits.

I clean him up in the dream along with it.

I was awoken. I am about to tell it to my partner in my slumber and he got a message from our old co-worker, he had passed away in the night. The man who was so broken had walked into the light like a champ, and on some level despite having left the place, my work there wasn't done.

I am wondering if he called for aid, or if I was always meant to aid. But all I know is, that he got the aid he needed to cross over despite a very traumatic and drawn-out death that was a little more than torture.

To see that man, healed and the whole is amazing, now he wears a robe in the light. Out of all those I cared for, I struggled with him. Watching the way he deteriorated and was depressed was awful to watch. Seeing his wasted away form will stick. But seeing how he is now will also stick.

I know I and many others do a lot of spiritual stuff in the sleep state, but this was intense. It again cements everything I am aware of, but what was communicated between us wasn't possible to verbalize, comprehend. It was simply raw compassion. A musical score, a concept, telepathy, all at once. Such that my spirit guide said the human brain cannot physically perceive that at third-density most of the time.

I notice my spiritual senses become more heightened lately. I can say this, I am so happy he is now in the light, and free from his difficult incarnation end.

It's like, the pure Self/consciousness doesnt have any preferences, it just is. And so everything that I am, all my 'preferences' are just a product of my experiences/conditioning. My ""Self"", being impartial and pure, doesn't actually care about any of the things that I like, from my favorite foods to my sexual orientation... This is a scary place to come to, to realize that everything that I am is just a product of unconscious conditioning through coincidental experiences. For example, if my spirit/self grew up through anyone else's experiences in their physical body, I would be precisely them. I would like the things they like. 

I guess what i'm really asking here is, does anyone believe that the Self has any individuality compared to other Self's? Is there any free will in the creation of the preferences that each person has? Is the Self the basis of our preferences or is it just our experiences and conditioning that shape everything about us?",1605984375.0
spirituality,What is my faith/religion?,"(I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I honestly don‚Äôt know where to ask.)

So I was raised protestant and I always kind of doubted it, and a few months ago I became an atheist.  But I‚Äôve been questioning that and have new beliefs but the problem is that they aren‚Äôt from any set religion I am aware of.

Here is what I believe:

Alternate universes/dimensions.  I think god(s) aren‚Äôt humanoid or animalistic, they are some great objectlike plane.  Possibly a wheel or a book, and all realities are on that book/wheel.
I also believe in karma.  I‚Äôm not sure about after death though, afterlife, quantum immortality and ceasing to exist are all equally a reasonable idea to me.

A personal feeling that may be related to religion:
Sometimes I look in the mirrior and expect to see animal parts.  I think that ‚Äúthere is no way I‚Äôm human, that doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù and I expect to see animal like parts that aren‚Äôt there.  I‚Äôm not otherkin either.

i think she often sends me signs through numerology. example i saw the number 27 at least 20 times a day for like an entire year. it has dramatically slowed down and now i often see the number 444 amongst many other repeating numbers such as 333 555 1111. i know their meanings btw.",1605976401.0
spirituality,"Numb, Healing, Release, Let Go (39)","Every so often I think about where I was 1 year ago. I think about how I felt, what I was doing (consciously and subconsciously), how I was Numb, how I was Hurt, Broken, Dedicated, Healing (without realizing).

In times that we can only live day to day with minor planning ahead, it allows me to realize how far I have come for myself in the past year. With my broken heart, my identity and who I am as a Human Being.

Starting my creative path over 2 and half years ago, my only intention was to create, as it is now. Through time, God and The Universe has guided me into different projects and different areas of my life that I never even knew existed back then. It all takes time, which is something I tell myself everyday. That the work being done right now is for something more than expected. Its about trying, everyday. Trying something new, progressing on work already started or simply changing up routines and habits that I can get stuck into if I allow myself.

Habits and Routines are needed, to some degree. The habits and routines that I try and break out of each day is my comfortability. I have learned that my body and mind will constantly try and trap me in my comfortability from things in the past that I was doing without realizing.

Identifying as a Trans Woman has been a rollercoaster. A rollercoaster of emotions, feelings and actions that have no end in sight, nor that I want it to. Every moment is new. Every moment I am changing, evolving, releasing, growing, healing and making peace with. I have come to learn that with my body dysphoria, gender dysphoria, those things will take time to change and it has allowed me to make peace with the present moment. Its only for a little while longer so I might as well enjoy while it lasts. Heck, its been 23 years, I know I can do a little bit more. Somedays are easy, Somedays are difficult, but it is all **worth** it.

Today: Enjoy the day that we have been given. The day that is New and that even in the present is passing by. Do something that makes you feel anxious inside, scared, its meant for your growth and who you are. I Believe in You.

I love you.

spirituality,"We're not always kind to ourselves - but you can let go of suffering by starting to look at yourself with fresh eyes, accepting what you see without judgement","If you have kids/nieces/nephews you might have seen a baby suddenly become aware of their hand. They look at the palm, they look at the fingers, then they turn it over and realise there‚Äôs a back of the hand. And if they tell the fingers to move, it they wiggle! They laugh and laugh until the next experience comes along.  That‚Äôs what beginners mind is - approaching the world without assumptions, without judgement, without an idea in our heads for how things ought to be - just observing, accepting, feeling gratitude and joy. When we apply beginners mind to our loved ones, our environment and our work/studies we have a deeper appreciation for what we have and can live happier lives.

Its also helpful to apply beginners mind to ourselves, particularly if we have problems with self esteem - we sometimes judge ourselves harshly and are not kind when we look in the mirror. By focusing our awareness in our body, noticing what we're experiencing, accepting ourselves and practicing non-judgement we can learn to appreciate what we have and be kind to ourselves.A body scan is a great way to do this, and it has the added bonus of releasing tension and giving us a sense of peace.

spirituality,Tips on Suffering,"What suffering feeds on:

&amp;#x200B;

* Struggle - Trying to run away or get rid of the suffering.
* Conflict - ""Oh I'm not suffering. I'm too spiritual to suffer."" (when we totally are suffering)
* The Story of Ourselves - ""I'm suffering because of them or this or that.""
* The Past and Future - ""I shouldn't of done this, I'm worried about that, etc.""
* The ""NO"" - If you look closely at suffering you'll find it always contains a NO. ""I don't like this, I don't want that, no no no.

&amp;#x200B;

What suffering can't stand:

* Awareness / Presence - Suffering is 99% mind made. When we rest our attention in awareness, instead of following the story, space is created and suffering naturally dissolves. 
* Curiosity - What is my suffering made of? Who is it for?
* Love - When we open to our suffering, welcome it, love it, say YES to it, it dissolves into our love.
* The YES - We can never suffer a yes!

&amp;#x200B;

The more interested and open we become to ""the one who suffers"" or the nature of suffering itself, the less we directly identify with the suffering.",1605967565.0
spirituality,A lion/ a carnivore get Moksha (freedom from cycle of life and death)," A lion cannot get Moksha until the lion is born as a human being. A lion is not a Karta, the doer of action, a lion is only a Bhokta, the experiencer of Karma. It is said that only human beings are fortunate to be able to attain Moksha, Liberation, freedom from the cycle of death. What happens when we are born as a lion or tiger or dog? We are only paying for our Karma, we are only negating our negative Karmas. When that cycle is over, when that life is over, we will return back to being a human being and then we have to start our journey to be able to be liberated with Moksha.",1605966944.0
spirituality,Salvation," Salvation, in its true sense, is becoming one with God. Different religions call it by different names, Hindus call it Moksha, Buddhists call it Nirvana, and the western world calls it Enlightenment. But yes, in essence, it means freedom but what freedom are we talking about? It is freedom from misery and suffering ‚Äì freedom from the pain of the body, misery of the mind and agony of the ego. When we live, we all experience this kind of suffering, nobody can escape it. Before we die, we suffer. Unfortunately, we don't realize the cycle of life; we don't realize that the kingdom of God is within, that God lives in the temple of our heart. We don't realize that we are manifestations of God. When we overcome our ignorance and realize the Truth, we have freedom from ignorance. Then, there is liberation at death and unification with the Divine. This is Salvation.",1605966526.0

Calculations have transactional value only. You want to feel relieved, satisfied with calculations. Natural friction¬†on which life is sustained is smothered.

We simply want relief through thinking, through our calculations, projections, by thinking as if there can be flawless choices. You want to feel relieved by knowing, by thinking about accomplishing, by thinking about result, about tomorrow. As this is not possible, complications arise.  
Once we see that this relief can not be secured, we become comfortable with uncertainty, ambiguity, confusion.

Aka the law of attraction or manifestation.  6d consciousness that lives in a dimension with some alternative outcomes made outside.  Such as one where COVID doesn‚Äôt exist.

He's very clearly saying you just sit back in the seat of consciousness, the Self, and watch things happen to your person....To me it really sounds like he's saying to just become entirely apathetic toward it all. And it's like, okay cool, for negative emotions thats great and all because things wont get to you so much. But why would you want to just sit back and watch positive emotions? Shouldn't you immerse yourself fully in these? It seems like a rather lonely place to be... I feel like you can't feel love on a deep level if you're just sat back there in the seat of the Self watching it happen, not caring whether it stays or goes because ultimately you'll just 'let go' immediately anyways.

This used to make me feel shitty to be honest, that I have wasted part of my day that I could have been spending time towards my craft, or simply going through my morning routines. I have come to realize that Yes, Opportunities are great to captivate on and we can catch up on Sleep, but Sleep is the only way we will be able to continue chugging along on the highway. 

I have come to learn to follow how my body feels and allow myself to sleep more if needed, start slower if needed &amp; go at my own pace. I have realized that in the past and still sometimes now, when I am beating myself up, dwelling, feeling down or trying to rush through something, then thats me subconsciously comparing myself to someone else that I have seen on Social Media or this day to day set of requirements I have for myself, that happens subconsciously without even realizing it.

I have come to learn and make peace with going at my own speed and releasing the need of comparing myself to others, that I am not going fast enough or that I haven't gotten an opportunity that I want. It took for me to go through anxiety attacks &amp; mental breakdowns to realize that instead of enjoying the moment and the process, I was creating more tension and battles with myself. It all takes time and I know that it was all meant to be.

Give yourself the time needed. Give yourself the space needed. Give yourself the rest needed. Give yourself the fresh air needed. Enjoy the process and journey, rather than being obsessed with the destination. God/Higher Power/The Universe always has more in store than we think, that happens organically and effortlessly through dedicated hard work.

I love you.

spirituality,Freedom has only exposed how worthless and incapable I am,"The spirituality I've seen has often idolized freedom and authenticity. Some who have posted here in the past have talked about expressing your true self and doing what you want to do.

My spiritual journey has illuminated to me that I have been using my mind to protect myself. If a social group was bad for me, I recognized it and stayed away from them.  If I would fail at playing football, I stayed away from it because I knew it wouldn't be worth it.

All of these decisions seemed wise and intelligent at the time, but now I realize that I am very weak. Engaging in unhealthy situations has made other people strong. They seem to have gone through challenges and learned to wield the toxicity they were exposed to.

In contrast, I remained healthy but vulnerable because I was never exposed to that kind of toxicity. Now, I am someone who is easy to bully. I need others to be kind to me, because I am weak and it is easy for others to overwhelm me with pain and depression.

I am now completely lost on what I should be doing. It seems to me now that my efforts to protect myself have almost been counterproductive. Others have developed far beyond me and easily disrupt me and take me out.

I don't know what to do. These issues have crept up on me over time and I have been depressed for the last several years.  Everything is difficult. It turns out that freedom is not good for me, because I will get taken advantage of pretty easily.

spirituality,Self confidence vs ego?,"For the past year I have been trying to dissolute my ego and take a step back to look at things in a more objective perspective. Now a days I always pause and think before posting something on social media or saying anything in a social setting to evaluate whether what I'm doing is me feeding my own ego or not. I used to be so confident and comfortable in myself but now I feel so insecure about my abilities and appearance.

I understand that having an ego is very normal since it is one of human's survival instincts but to me it has changed me drastically to the point where I'm not even sure who I am anymore. I feel worthless sometimes. Just wondering whether anyone has gone through this phase",1605887316.0
spirituality,How do you know if it was a past life?,"I think I found out who one of my past lives was.

It was at that moment my life went full circle and it explained so many circumstances that I‚Äôve encountered in this lifetime. This is the run down of some of those situations.... The wreck that flashed in front of me was many broken bones.  I had a patient that drove her vehicle through my office building. In that same week I had a gang member flip his car in my yard and gave me a gun to hide for him. Which I did not  do that. Both of them were saying some of the exact things my dad was saying after his wreck. I caught on fire when I was 8 years old. I engulfed in flames, and my Dad put me out with his hands. Our house burned down a week before my wedding. ll It‚Äôs so many circumstances that involve auto accidents, fire, and broken bones. I can‚Äôt help to feel as though this is why.

spirituality,Those blue lights coming out from my hands,"
By Alessandro Carosi

Seven years ago I arrived in London leaving New Zealand a land I had at finally fell in Love and that for reasons I won‚Äôt explain here this time I was forced to move away, maybe was meant to be or maybe I was just an idiot, either case I learned a lesson.

In UK was a new beginning where I wanted to change and grow spiritually and personally, oh my God it felt easy at the very beginning but then slowly I got back to the hold habits, sure thing I wanted to move on from some women that by myself I created dramas and pain, one in special, a Beautiful Korean girl that still now I can‚Äôt forget, I did for 3-4 months and then is where all the new journey begun, I removed any thoughts or desire of this sexy Dancer and focused in the most important moment, the here and now, for a while it did work and slowly I begun to feel amazing like I was building up energies, spiritual energies, day after day I felt lighter, happier, serene, I emanated something that drew the right people and circumstances to me, I was noticed by people for no apparent reason or maybe there was, it was an energy that couldn‚Äôt be seen but felt, I remember an evening when one of the guests in the hostel I lived for 6 months told me that my hands had something peculiar, he said that my hands was special, I didn‚Äôt take him seriously but the thought of what he said stayed in the back of my mind considering that my Grandmother was a healer and used her hands to healing people.

Synchronicities followed me since I left Italy and have been my companion for the last 14 years especially in New Zealand where I had them so often that to believe that they were just coincidences was something to don‚Äôt take in consideration any longer, obviously they didn‚Äôt stop in London where to start I found myself living on Craven road that guess what was the street where the character of my favourite comic, Dylan Dog had his office, he was a Detective but a special one, he investigated in supernaturals, Spirits, Ghosts and monsters, my life have been and still full of monsters, spirits, ghosts and supernaturals events, not a case that I would end up in that street and the biggest extraordinary event would take place there.

I didn‚Äôt feel so good for such a long time and the prolonged state of awareness focused in the here and now made me feel lighter, stronger and happier ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ then a night something extraordinary happened that changed the course of my spiritual searching drastically, I went to sleep calm and relaxed and fell asleep immediately then around I think 2 am I woke up surrounded by an ethereal silence, I looked at my roommate sleeping peacefully and from the window the light of some streetlamps would pass through the glass just enough to allowed me to see in the darkness, I was about to go back to sleep when I noticed something coming out of my fingertips, a blue light would surround them while touching my blankets, the most interesting thing was that I wasn‚Äôt surprised or shocked it felt the most normal thing in the world, everything I would touch would light up, the blankets, my pajamas, the mattress, I was emotionless except a peaceful curiosity discovering how many things I could touch having my fingertips lighting up, I can‚Äôt remember for how long I kept doing it but I remember getting over it and decide to go back to sleep.

I woke up again in the morning around 8-9 am and as soon my eyes was wide open the memories of what happened hit me so strong that almost knocked me down, what the hell was that? why that happened to me? why I was so calm and indifferent when that happened and what was supposed to be? There was no way I could explain it and at the time no one I could talk to, I needed to have a walk to clear my mind, to think properly, that was overwhelming and I had no clue, zero clue, all I wanted was to tell it to everyone but no one would believe it or at least I felt it in that way so I kept it for myself for many years, I removed my pajamas to wear a jumper and the loudest electric static come from my body, I never heard something like that, the only way I could interpret it was that during the night my body fully recharged like a battery but over the years I then come to the conclusion that probably in that 3-4 months living in the here and now experiencing so much bless and peacefulness recharged my Soul, I never got back to that stage but other extraordinary events took place after that, like if that night I opened the doors to an other world, the world of the Souls.

Seven years passed by and many other pieces of the puzzle are added to the bigger picture, I‚Äôm trying to understand what that was about, I‚Äôm a healer like my grandmother ? or it was just to show me that there is more in life ? I‚Äôm confuse more then ever especially after sometime feeling disconnected from what we could call it ‚ÄùThe Source‚Äù in Edinburgh I met a France guy that had a similar experience but him like me its searching for an answer and to find himself , what was about then, maybe whatever interpretation I give it will be the right one.",1605862405.0

spirituality,Beware of New Age ‚ÄúCoaching‚Äù Scams,"This is incredibly long but please consider reading the red flags throughly. I have also sourced much of the information I speak about as well as what I‚Äôve observed from certain (not all) youtube channels that exhibit this behavior.

Hey y‚Äôall. I originally made a post about a certain ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù youtuber who was scamming people, but I felt inclined to teach everyone how to spot these MLM scams (in case u don‚Äôt already know) that are arising. Despite whatever beliefs you may have, please note that these scams are incredibly real &amp; detrimental for those who become victims of it. Use your own healthy skepticism &amp; critical thinking to discern information, and help raise awareness to this scam. Especially considering that people are being sued for ‚Äúdefamation of character,‚Äù when speaking out against these folks. In my opinion, educating people to stay safe feels more effective instead of giving more traffic to these ‚Äúspiritual guru youtubers,‚Äù that may or may not be running a pyr@mid scheme. Bad press is any press (to them) so I prefer helping people figure out the tools to spot these people themselves. 

Disclaimer: I am no expert nor do I ever claim to be, but I have sourced all the links for where I got this info. Also ALWAYS do your own extensive research before you purchase ANYTHING or listen to anyone, especially online where it‚Äôs easy to lie. Having financial boundaries is important too. 

A phenomenon known as ‚Äúspiritual narcissism‚Äù has been gaining notoriety with the rise of LOA. These people have similar attributes to textbook narcissists but use spirituality as a vehicle to harm and lure in vulnerable people. This is most common with those who are less familiar or are new to spiritual concepts. The FTC also reports that most online scams happen from the age range of 30-39, (FTC 2020, sourced below). If you or anyone you know has been scammed or if you witness a scammer, do not hesitate to fill out a form to the Federal Trade Commission so they can further investigate these frauds and/or help you get your money back. Doing so is incredibly easy and accessible online and usually only takes 10-15 minutes(sourced below). As a general rule of thumb, take everything with a grain of salt, even this.

Red Flags:

a) Creating codependency &amp; cult-like mindsets in their followers. Spirituality is incredibly personal &amp; relies on you to do the introspective work. if anyone claims that the ‚Äúonly way you can achieve a certain vibration‚Äù is through their expensive workshop or that they‚Äôre the ones that can help bring you ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù know that they are lying. You do not NEED anyone but yourself to reach enlightenment. I‚Äôd strongly advise that if you are new to these concepts, start simple with 5 minute meditations. Don‚Äôt overcomplicate things and risk your own wellbeing because somebody told you so. In general I would advise you avoid ‚Äúcoaches‚Äù as they usually charge ridiculous amounts of money for content that you can easily access for free online. 

b) Contradiction &amp; hypocrisy. If someone claims to be a ‚Äúhighly spiritual guru‚Äù or anything along those lines yet is constantly putting emphasis on material goods, sex, power, and hoarding wealth, proceed with caution. A lot of these times these people will also put a lot of effort into maintaining their appearance or think of themselves very highly (in an unhealthy manner). They will usually have their own website that uses marketing schemes that ‚Äúsound too good to be true.‚Äù These people may just be taking advantage of LOA concepts &amp; renting expensive cars/homes claiming that ‚Äúthey manifested their dream life.‚Äù Also, most spiritual you tubers who are spreading information to actually help others will put more emphasis around healing your inner self first, concepts such as kindness, generosity, flow, mindfulness, forgiveness, and etc are more aligned with those who are actually attempting to come from a place of unconditional love. Most times, those with the intent of love will leave their  venmo or patreon &amp; not EXPECT you to pay them. Or they won‚Äôt charge $100‚Äôs for a ‚Äúprogram.‚Äù Tarot readers will generally offer personal readings but they won‚Äôt be incredibly expensive (as they know people are struggling during the pandemic) be wary of readers who only tell you what you want to hear &amp; have messages that don‚Äôt actually resonate but sound pretty. 

c) Clickbait thumbnails &amp; ego traps. Many fake spiritual youtubers will use flamboyant text and/or clickbait thumbnails + titles for people who are desperate and/or impatient. Also, be careful if they put high emphasis on constantly upholding beauty standards. Most enlightened individuals are looking to move AWAY from these rigid structures. In no way am I saying all attractive people are evil, but be careful that you aren‚Äôt looking through rose colored glasses &amp; actually listen to what they‚Äôre SAYING. Although it‚Äôs nice to feel and look good, constantly speaking about losing weight and/or eating a certain way when they‚Äôre not licensed professionals is a yikes. They will also pervert LOA into something that it‚Äôs not saying that ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt get a Lamborghini you didn‚Äôt try hard enough.‚Äù Everyone‚Äôs path is different, and suddenly having a Lamborghini will not always bring you spiritual nourishment.  

d) Forcing a certain thinking structure. Most enlightened individuals usually frame their lessons in a way that is either straight to the point and/or always you to think introspectively. They will not have a bunch of fluff to lure you into buying their programs. They also do not use marketing tactics to excite your ego in an unhealthy way. They will not tell you you‚Äôre wrong or say that make you feel bad about yourself/less than. If someone is telling you what to think or believe instead of HOW you can think/believe in a way that aligns to your truth, be wary. 

e) Fake live webinars! If someone is a youtuber &amp; they‚Äôre constantly attempting to drive their subscribers off the youtube platform: red flag!! Youtube offers a live stream service where people can directly give the youtubers money for the stream. It will also say if the YouTuber is ACTUALLY live or simply premiered a prerecorded video. Lying about being ‚Äúlive‚Äù is incredibly sketchy, and there‚Äôs no reason someone would do that unless they were trying to purposefully trick you. 

f) They delete, fake, or sue people for valid criticism. If these youtubers were the real deal, they wouldn‚Äôt need to constantly ‚Äúhush‚Äù people for exercising their right to freedom of speech. They also wouldn‚Äôt turn off all their comments. Unless you are being outright hateful, everyone has the right to give any creator feedback. The only reason why someone wouldn‚Äôt want constructive criticism, is if they didn‚Äôt care about the quality of the work they were doing in the first place. 

g) They rarely talk about their own life experiences, and when they do, it‚Äôs very ‚Äúsurface level.‚Äù The spiritual journey can require you to look deep within your self and confront your inner self head on. I‚Äôm not saying that every spiritual youtuber has to constantly talk about themselves, but dark &amp; heavy concepts are normal &amp; should be brought to light. If someone only talks about ‚ÄúI was poor &amp; now I‚Äôm not!‚Äù Instead of, ‚ÄúI was selfish, and insecure, and now I‚Äôve learned to accept myself &amp; others,‚Äù its a red flag. What they say about themselves may not even be true, and causes you to question everything. If they can constantly lie about their ‚Äúprograms,‚Äù then why would they tell you their real experiences or even their full name? 

h) Their analytics on social-blade have random spikes. If the amount of views they receive per video range from 11k-25k &amp; they randomly have a couple 1 million viewed vids or 1 million followers, its super sus. I‚Äôm not saying that all their views have to match, but on social blade if their analytics aren‚Äôt a steady incline, it could be a sign they bought fake followers and/or views. This is so they can say, ‚ÄúSee! I got all these followers bc I manifested so well, now buy my program so you can be like me &amp; get rich!‚Äù 

i) Lastly, they don‚Äôt have a holistic mindset. If they constantly emphasize toxic positivity...its a no for me. Having emotions is spiritual!! Allowing these emotions to flow, and accepting them as a natural way of life is part of a holistic mindset. Can you only breathe in for the rest of your life? No, breathing in and out serves a purpose, much like the concept of yin &amp; yang. Light &amp; shadow. Anyone attempting to spiritually, emotionally, or mentally stunt you by invalidating your emotions is a symptom of textbook narcissism. These people WANT you to feel inferior to them &amp; put up a ‚Äúpositive facade‚Äù so that you can financially support their lavish lifestyle and never question their motives. 

If you got to the end I hope you found value in this. Please stay safe during this time and remember: a wolf can hide in sheeps clothing. Much love &amp; namasteüíú

spirituality,Feeling the presence of a loved one right before they pass?,"My mom passed away 2 days ago. For a couple of hours before her death, my sister and I were in the hospital cafeteria, just talking. I told her that i felt our mom there, and then eventually I felt her presence fade. A couple minutes later my dad texted me and told us she said she loves us and she was awake (she'd been asleep for hours, that's why my sister and i went downstairs), so we hurried back upstairs. I think she came back to say goodbye. She died a few hours later.
I just wonder if she was watching over me that night as she faded in and out. It sure felt like it.
I think maybe it was just her spiritual self, so in her physical body she didn't know, but she asked why everything was green when we got there, so i think maybe she was in a garden and she forgot (because she seemed confused about it after). She was really confused.

I couldnt feel pain that day but i could feel others pain, i was using my friends pc and the game said i could sense a lot of anger in you(it was fallout 4), i went outside for a walk and everything that i imagined became true still, i did a lot of bad things after like going to shops and getting ice cream for free, i felt totally free and others were like robots or non sentient, i did a lot of bad things til i got tired, i was walking bare foot, i felt like i was a god.

Couple of days later i went out to an island there i went for a run and i talked to someone he told me im really open energitically, i finished my run and sat by the dancing fountain, and i saw human like figures diving into water, i went to get a cup of coffee and the owner there told me so i wanna kill the whole world lol, i told him do we live in a simulation he said yes.

spirituality,So who was Jesus?,"I‚Äôm an Omnist. I don‚Äôt have a religion but I believe there is some truth in all religions. I was having a (very one sided) heated discussion with some friends who claim to be spiritually awakened yet believe that Jesus died for our sins. I believe Jesus was a real person. I believe Jesus‚Äô teaching in the Bible are true, however I also believe the Bible we have today is not the original- I believe it‚Äôs been perverted from its original text, with parts added, revised, and taken away. I believe this because I believe in an elite society that runs the earth that doesn‚Äôt want the true teachings allowed to the public for whatever reason they have (to create division to conquer the masses, etc). So my question is, who the heck was Jesus really? I believe he was no different than me or the person reading this. I believe that Jesus was a spiritually awakened man, who was able to tap into the rich teachings of the universe and was able to heal the sick through the use of reiki (something anyone can do if they believe they can). Was Jesus the literal son of god? Mm I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôve heard of symbolism where the ‚Äúson of god‚Äù is meant to represent the literal sun. And that the last supper is representative of the 12 zodiacs. I haven‚Äôt dived deep into that side but that made more sense to me than Jesus coming and saving the ‚Äúgood people‚Äù in some rapture. I believe the earth always has been and always will be. It is just another dimension on this plane of existence. So the rapture has to have another meaning to it. I‚Äôve heard that the Bible, according to Damien Echols, is ‚Äúthe greatest book of magick, once you know how to read it.‚Äù And that is part of why I‚Äôm here today. I have many theories that I believe to be true. But I‚Äôm open to others opinions of the topic bc I don‚Äôt know for sure, I only have my own guesses.

This is the final stand for our freedom."" She tells me she knows we're all being lied to and how it has always happened. I then take a step back and realize, she is completely right. She isn't ignorant, she just doesn't care about something she can't really control. She always tells me everything will be alright (I have some pretty bad anxiety which I don't even want to accept I have). She has been right, pretty much everytime.   


I have everything in my life yet I keep worrying about money. I even built a business with my fianc√© during covid and earned a pretty penny but now it's not making money and I really have no motivation to keep trying different things, this brings more anxieties to my life and I think I should just drop it and live in the moment. My job is good enough for now.

The most mysterious mythological creature in human history is by far,  the dragon. Dragons have been so heavily represented in cultures the  world over even while they were isolated from one another that many  researchers have suggested that there was probably dragons or some  dragon-like creature that indeed existed. In what form, however, is  speculative, because some cultures view them differently. European  traditions view them as quadrupedal, winged, fire-breathing protectors  of great treasure. Meanwhile, Hawaiian tales refer to them as  essentially just large, peaceful lizards that had magical powers. For  our purposes here, however, we will be focusing on working with the  general dragon archetype for improving/healing your life.

Some people claim that dragons are excellent power-animals, but in my  book a power-animal is the actual spirit of an animal which you can  take on as an ally. They are not of human origin. All archetypes here on  Earth today are of human origin. Archetypes are basically just symbols  that like any symbol, one can work with to achieve various goals. As an  archetype, dragons represent radiant power. Especially the power to  remove obstacles. Their stupendous power can do so many things such as  increase your wealth, remove malicious spirits, increase your strength  and provide protection. I.E. it is a general powerhouse for physical,  mental, emotional, spiritual and even circumstantial  healing/improvement.

### Working With The Dragon Archetype

Some people like to be very specific with what dragon they work with  depending on the qualities of the dragon and the goal in question. I‚Äôve  gone ahead and made a perfect dragon which has any and all qualities you  could possibly want. It‚Äôs a white, European-style dragon which breathes  pure, white fire. It and its fire is white, because it is perfect as  it‚Äôs an embodiment of Source(essence of God) which is often described as  brilliant white light of love by yogis and those who have had  near-death experiences. You are free to use my dragon or make up your  own if you wish. To work with the dragon archetype I always just use a  simple meditation I have dubbed, *The* *Dragon‚Äôs Breath Meditation.* To perform it, follow the steps listed below‚Ä¶

1. For best results, sit down with the eyes closed and the spine comfortably erect.

2. Calm your mind and relax your muscles.

3. Perform three rounds of Sky-Earth Piko-Piko(fully inhale with your  awareness focused far above your head in the sky and fully exhale with  your awareness focused far below you in the Earth).

4. Visualize your dragon before you. It radiates pure power.

5. Calm your mind and relax your muscles even further.

6. Have your dragon breathe out its ultra-powerful, white fire and  allow it to envelope you or a circumstance you wish to heal/improve.

&amp;#x200B;

* Note, this fire is not innately destructive like a normal flame. It  is an expression of pure, loving and perfect power infused with Source  itself.
* If you‚Äôre working the dragon archetype for removing financial debt  for example, perhaps visualize its fire burning up a stack of your bills  until they‚Äôre nothing, but fine ash.

7. Allow any and all internal changes you feel in response to this  breath of fire to occur and happen as they may for some minutes until  you feel no more changes occurring.

8. Open your eyes very slowly, check for changes and repeat as necessary.

This is how I always work with the dragon archetype. I find that any  healing/improvement I wish to gain can be ultimately be aided by this  meditation, but there are a few other applications which are more direct  that you might be interested in. Note, I do not own the following  material. All credit goes to Jim Fallon, associate of the Huna  Organization.

‚ÄúYou can use a Dragon to clear spaces by having the Dragon just flap  its wings and clear the energy of the desired space. You can take a  magical flight with a Dragon, or use Dragon sight to see remote places  and situations.

**Dance with your Dragon**

Journey to your Dragon and take him/her to one of the seven gardens,  in this case, the garden of Aloha.Let your dragon invite other dragon  friends. As group, dance around a campfire in this big party your  giving. As you dance, allow the spirit of your Dragon to enter your  body, in other words, grok your Dragon. This allows you to serve as a  vehicle for your Dragon to be expressed through your body, your physical  form. The Dragon‚Äôs SongThe Dragon‚Äôs song is a frequency and vibration  that helps to influence ordinary reality. Ask your Dragon what song is  relevant for you or for a specific request or goal. After asking, simply  wait and listen for any song that comes into you awareness. You can  just hum the tune. Listen to the words. Once you know the tune and  words, you can sing it or hum it to invoke the presence of your Dragon.

**Dragon Divination**

Simply journey to your Dragon, ask the Dragon your question, and then  listen for a returning thought that will be your answer, which you may  receive through a visual image, or a auditory response, or through a  feeling, or just a thought or any combination of the above‚Äù ‚Äì *Jim Fallon*",1605838112.0

spirituality,Chakra balancing Orgone Pyramid," 

 **Orgonite is a substance made from resin, metals and quartz that balances and harmonizes bio-energy, otherwise known as orgone, chi or prana.**  


**""Orgone is the light, the universal energy which is present in everything, it is what stops the decrease and creates the cure"".**  


**ORGONE is known as prana, life force, ki, chi, mana, universal energy ... etc**  


**Austrian psychiatrist Dr Wilhelm Reich studied orgone energy in the first half of the 20th century, and today's orgonite devices are built on his findings. In conducting his research, mr. Reich found that organics attract and hold orgone energy, while non-organic metals simultaneously attract and repel energy.**  


**Orgonite is based on these two principles. It is a 50-50 mixture of resin (organic, due to the fact that it is based on petrochemicals), and metal shavings (inorganic). A quartz crystal is also added inside the orgonite matrix. The unbalanced energy is absorbed into the orgonite by the metal-resin mixture, and brought back to a healthy and vibrant state by the incorporated crystal.**

Basically this reality has been a sort of dream, where conscious entities were asleep, literally creating this reality through thoughts, manifestation. You can make this live a living hell or heaven, a dream or a nightmare, and its all based on your thoughts/perceptions.

Now what the shift is, it‚Äôs the expansion of imagination. Using your imagination works out the consciousness yes, but now, I‚Äôm starting to see how manifestation can work with imagination and abstract thought as well.

I‚Äôm unsure if this is the shift people were waiting for, but I can say it has expanded the possibilities for me now that I understand how the imagination works.",1605820153.0

spirituality,Ever Notice spiritual themes/messages in Popular Movies and TV?,"Since starting my spiritual journey a little over a year ago, I've been reading A LOT about esoteric subjects/concepts. Then I found this subreddit and it's really helped me come to a lot of realizations. I feel like I've learned so much and yet the more I learn, the more questions I have!

One thing that I can't seem to get out of my head though is that there are these common themes and ideas I keep seeing time and time again in the media I consume. I'll be rewatching a popular movie I've loved since I was a child and I'll hear a phrase or sentiment that jumps out at me like, ""This is exactly what you just learned about in [whatever book I'm currently reading about spirituality]!"" It never fails to make me smile, it's like the universe is telling me, ""All of this has been right in front of you the whole time.""

I've always been a huge film nerd. I have a BA in Film and I've wanted to make movies since I was a child. Basically, I feel like I've been pulled towards film all my life.

When I started diving deep into spiritual topics and noticing the connections to films, it was like the brightest lightbulb ever flashed in my head. I immediately started coming up with plans to pursue a career related to this. I don't mean to toot my own horn but I do have expertise in analyzing films and making them, so everything about this seemed perfect to me.

I haven't recorded the hours I put into starting my channel and writing, shooting, and editing my first video over the past couple months, but I'd estimate it to be well over 200. It's been incredibly challenging and I have learned SO MUCH. But I feel like this is definitely what I was put on this Earth to do and there's not a doubt in my mind I can be successful doing this. 

And success for me would be creating a place where people can come to if they're passionate about these topics and are curious about all of this as much as I am! Obviously I intend for the videos I make to be about sharing what I've learned with others, but I'm just as interested in learning about these things together. That's why I wanted to share my first video here and ask you all for any advice you have on where I can improve, and maybe ideas for what YOU would like to see talked about more as far as spirituality in movies/TV goes.

**TL;DR**

During my deep dive into spirituality, I started seeing some of those same ideas and themes in the movies I watch. So I wanted to share those connections with others since I found it so interesting.

Anyways, I'm incredibly grateful to anyone who takes the time to watch :)

I'll be so happy if anyone here gets anything out of this video. Much love to you all!!",1605812526.0

spirituality,I had my chakras read,"Just to catch everyone up to speed, my chakras and the tarot cards we pulled as well as the gemstones infused in the cards are listed below. (This was a hierophant deck)- 

Crown - Nine of swords - Sugilite
Third Eye - Three of wands - Garnet
Throat - Eight of cups - Aquamarine
Heart - Death - Phantom quartz
Solar Plexus - Four of cups - Aquamarine
Sacral - Four of wands - Garnet
Root - The Hierophant - Amethyst

Now for some background, swords are generally my most common card, before we read my chakras we read swords for my past and present and wands as my future. Neither of us have seen any name cards before this, and the pattern was too uniform to overlook. We draw two more cards, The Fool and The World. The World being flipped over had so much energy I was genuinely covered in goosebumps and crying. Our understanding was I had closed the page on a chapter of my life where I was ‚Äúsetting my feet‚Äù so I would be in a position to accomplish great things I know I‚Äôm capable of. This next chapter of my life involves letting go of something close to my heart, to give me freedom. Specifically freedom for travel and romance. My dream ever since I was a child was to become a champion in MMA (live by the sword?). I‚Äôve been training for this since I could walk but recently I‚Äôve fallen out of a consistent training schedule and I‚Äôm trying to get myself in a good position so I can resume fighting in 2021. We believe I have ties that hold me back from this passion and I need to travel, to let go and free myself to connect with new people and ideas so I can further pursue my dream. Another interpretation we had was this is a sign that my non-romantic relationship with my best friend is dying and we will be free to have a romantic partnership. I know this is a bit of a ramble but is there anyone out there who thinks they could help me find out if now is the time to leave the female and pursue MMA or if now is the time to pursue the female and our relationship helps me become a fuller version of myself who will pursue MMA even harder? Maybe it‚Äôs both? Thank you for your time!

Side note for those interested - I‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of spiritual phenomena since the blue moon in October, I have many more scenarios to describe if you need to have a better understanding of where I am spiritually. Thank you so much for the energy",1605805869.0
spirituality,We don‚Äôt have a Soul‚Ä¶ We are the Soul!,"There is so much said about the Soul and its connection with the Divine, still we don‚Äôt realize that we are alive because of our Soul. We do everything else but forget to discover this truth. Various religions all over the world and famous philosophers of the past and of the present have advocated different views about it but the whole concept of the Soul remains an enigma. The myth of the Soul is one of the greatest mysteries in the world. People are unsure about the existence and reincarnation of the Soul. These questions have many speculations, but till date, they have not been demystified.

Everybody talks of the Soul, but not many know the true meaning of it. Just like the gold ring, the gold bracelet and the gold chain are nothing but gold, we too are nothing but the Soul. Just like gold is the cause, the Soul is our cause. Just like ornaments are effects, we too are mere effects. If we remove the cause, there is nothing left. It is the power of the Soul that makes man conscious of who he is. It lets man remain awake with body and mind and it is this very Soul that lets the body sleep as it continues to power the mind as it dreams subconsciously. The moment the Soul departs, man loses all his power. He loses his power to be conscious, awake, and aware. Without the Soul, man becomes nothing. Man has been unable to discover the power of the Soul. Without the power of the Soul, our muscles, our joints, our bones would be lifeless and incapable of any movement. We walk and talk, we sing and play, all because of the power within.

It seems we are like a computer that needs both hardware and software to function. If our laptop has no software, it wouldn‚Äôt work and without the hardware, the software has no meaning. Both hardware and software are needed for the gadget to function. But what about the power supply? If there were no battery or electrical power, would our laptop work? While we have discovered the body‚Äôs hardware ‚Äì the gross physical body and software ‚Äì the subtle body i.e., MIME‚Äîthe Mind, Memory, Intellect, and Ego, we have not paid attention to its power supply. What is the power supply that creates life in the human body? Some would do away with this question by saying it is food that gives energy to the body. But suddenly, why does the body stop working? It dies. They would argue that it is just like a machine, but their argument fails because a machine can be restarted. But a dead body can‚Äôt! This power supply is the Soul.

Air is everywhere but we can‚Äôt touch and feel it. However, if we take a dead rubber balloon and blow into it, we have taken some air from the universe and filled it into a balloon. The balloon now comes to life because of the air inside. If we deflate the balloon, can we retrieve the air that was inside it? Impossible! The air inside the balloon merges with the air that is everywhere. So does our Soul! The Soul seems to be energy that gives life to human beings from birth to death. It has a universal presence and is beyond human comprehension. It appears from the cosmos and goes back into the cosmos. It doesn‚Äôt take rebirth. The ‚Äòsubtle body‚Äô comprising the Mind, Ego, Memory, Intellect‚ÄîMIME, takes re-birth based on its Karmic balance.

The spiritual saints always believed that human beings are the manifestation of the Divine ‚Äì ‚Äòthey are not human beings having a spiritual experience on earth, but rather Souls having a human experience.‚Äô We human beings suffer because we are ignorant of the truth and believe in the myth that we are this body-mind complex. To realize the truth about the Soul is our life‚Äôs ultimate goal on the path to Enlightenment. Some people call it Nirvana or Moksha. People have to overcome their ignorance and realize the truth about the Soul so that they can be liberated from the triple suffering of the body, mind, and ego and live a life of eternal peace and bliss.",1605803839.0
spirituality,Is there a way I can connect on a deeper level with my dog?,"I‚Äôve had many pets in my life time and I‚Äôve always loved animals but I‚Äôve only ever really connected with three of them.  I could feel warmth in my heart almost like a string being connected to theirs. I felt that they acknowledged that as well and we had a super special bond. 

I now have a dog who was found roaming around Detroit. My friends dad picked him up and when I saw him I knew I was meant to have him. He‚Äôs the sweetest dog you could ever find but it was clear he was abused dispute being clean and well maintained when they found him. He always has such a sad look in his eyes and when you love on him he just melts in your arms. 

I was recently watching a video of a lady named Anna who could talk to animals. I was wondering if there‚Äôs a deeper way to communicate with my dog? I‚Äôve shared a connection with him like the other two. I‚Äôd really just like to understand him more and help with his anxiety. I‚Äôm empathic and can feel it radiating from him a lot and it gets worse when we leave him to go to work or run errands. We did have a moment once where I was really sad and he laid with me. After that moment though things were kind of weird and he didn‚Äôt seem to gravitate towards me as much. I‚Äôve never experienced that with an animal. I‚Äôve been comforted by them while sad but they‚Äôve never seemed distant afterwards.

Is there any such thing as an overview of many spiritual paths? Where all of them are introduced briefly including some practices, scriptures and respected teachers/ books etc. 

What I mean with a spiritual path is sort of a system aimed for spiritual growth and 'reaching' enlightenment. Including practices and metaphysical explanations which are not to be believed in blindly, but to be verified by oneself.

spirituality,A TREE WITHOUT ITS LIFE-GIVING SAP,"# A TREE WITHOUT ITS LIFE-GIVING SAP

## Meher Baba

Realisation of the Self should not be confused with the intellectual understanding of the Divine Theme. Exceptional exercise of the intellect makes one a philosopher, a poet, a scientist or an artist. But Self-realisation is undeniably the special privilege of those who are mad for God. 

Orthodoxy, whether it be Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Zoroastrian, Buddhist or of any other faith, is tolerable only up to a certain point, and only in the earlier phases of the evolution of the masses, since it conserves certain dynamic values coming down through tradition. But it must be of the discriminative type and should not be allowed to degenerate into politics. When orthodoxy denies to itself the spiritual light coming from any quarter, it inevitably reduces itself to a body without a soul, leading to separative ignorance, conflicts and misunderstandings. 

Loyalty to the incarnated greatness of the past and mere possession and knowledge of the traditional lore is not all that is to be desired. It may preserve your individuality as a religious and cultural unit and make of you a powerful political factor. But in the spiritual domain, it makes you a nonentity ‚Äî a tree without its life-giving sap.

this is my first post in this sub, before that I was just playing smartass üò¨

I‚Äôd like to get more perspective on this. I come from a place of psychology. It‚Äôs mostly Jungian and it‚Äôs close to shamanism IMO. I also studied and study a lot of of religions and philosophy. 
I did not encounter any ‚ÄûAngel Numbers‚Äú or similar in any of it. From where I come from this seems to be more of an esoterical phenomena. If I look at it from the paradigm of psychology I come to the same conclusion always, which is this seems to be some kind of Apophenia. From this paradigm I‚Äôm also kind of concerned, because on some level I believe to know that this can easily become a limiting complex. I‚Äôm also concerned with them becoming objective truths when it should be individual for everyone‚Äôs subconscious. 
On the other side of the coin, I also now that it can be helpful for some people, if it makes their psyche feel better. Whatever the psyche needs and whatever reduces suffering, I‚Äôm with that. 
When I look at spiritual growth, tho, I believe that it‚Äôs more about getting rid/unlearn of beliefs instead of building new ones. To be more blunt, atm I believe it‚Äôs a big trap for spiritual seekers and keeps you from looking at the real ‚Äûtruths‚Äú.

Can somebody enlighten me, please. Why does this seem to be so meaningful in this community? Am I dismissing something of value? What does it do for you?

spirituality,Making Sense of the Struggle in this Realm - We are Adam still Sleeping in the Garden waiting to Wake Up from this Illusion of Karmic Manifest Creation,"Don't attach to the illusion. This karmic realm that we fell in into is an illusion of a Dualistic mind that is separated from it Self. Creation is not broken. Your Higher Self, the Lord of Creation, is Creating just the right struggle for you that will cause you to be on your knees with suffering thus causing you to turn away from the outer realm and inward to your Spiritual Heart to seek for refuge in the Infinite Light of God in your Heart and in doing so reUnify back into Oneness with your Highest Self to end the illusion of manifest Creation. 

Adam went to Sleep in the Garden when his Divine Feminine (Unconditional Love for God) was split off and this manifest Creation of temptation, fear, shame, and Brother killing Brother began. We are still Adam sleeping in the Garden trying to Wake Up from this Karmic Manifestion of being separated from our Self. (""And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam"" - Genesis 2:21). Adam fell out of Heaven because he felt lonely meaning not in Oneness with God. As One is not lonely when they are Unified with their Highest Self. Adam's transgression that caused the Fall was desiring for something outside of the Infinite Light of God. 

It's very much like being in a nightmare except you are so convinced the dream is real that you can't seem to Wake Up from the Dream. But Waking Up from the dream means means raising the Divine Feminine (Unconditional Love for the Infinite Light of God in our Heart) back up to reUnify with the Divine Masculine in our Spiritual Heart to open our Heart Chakra to Heaven so that we can Ascend out of this dream of Karmic Creation to Realize we are Still Adam in the Ethereal Garden of Light. 

In this Karmic Realm we use the struggle as Spiritual Fuel to deepen our Love for God. The more we Struggle the more we go inward to our Spiritual Heart and Love and Comfort our Self till the struggle gets so bad that our Love for God grows so strong that we reUnify back into our Self and Wake Up from this nightmarish realm of Karmic Creation that we fell into. 

Everyone has a Soul. There is only One Soul and the many manifestations of that One Soul. All Souls are born Pure but then conditioned to become separated from them Self and get caught up in the illusion of this Karmic Realm. Hate the Sin, but Love the Sinner and Forgive them for they Know not what they do. See through the manifestation of evil to the Wounded Inner Child in their Heart and Love them Unconditionally as You Love your Self. 

We must learn to See that All of Creation is Divine Perfection from the perspective of Heaven and our Higher Self (the Lord of Creation) who is manifesting this Karmic Dream to give us the opportunity to Unconditionally Love God again despite the struggle which Heals our Karmic Separation from the Infinite Light of God and liberates our One shared Soul back into the Infinite Light of Unity and Oneness again.

And lest you think this is a dream and so I will do what I want, that way of thinking is Karmic and will Create a dream with even more struggle and suffering for you. This is the Law of Karma. So best to just go inward to your Spiritual Heart with Unconditional Love for the Infinite Light and All as One to end this dream of Karmic Separation forever and Wake Up from the illusion of Being separated from God.

Just like in a dream we think we are the dream character and separate from all the other Beings in the dream, but in Truth it's all one Dream manifest in the Present Moment out of the One Dreamer. 

We do not have freewill in the way that we think we do. Our ability to affect the Creation of the Dream is through our Vibration - how close or far away we are from the frequency of the Infinite Light of God which is Unconditional Love. 

The Lord of Creation manifests the Dream of this Karmic Manifestation including the characters in the Dream (both the dream character you identify with and the other characters in the Dream) and the Ways that they challenge you in Life. We are All One. 

In Truth the other Dream characters are manifestations of the Ways that we are not in Alignment with our Self. They are Karmic Manifestations of all the Ways we need to at-One for  not Unconditionally Loving and Believing in God. The Creation we perceive and experience, including the challenges, is a manifestation of our Karma - the ways we are separated from the Infinite Light of God. 

The struggle will get worse until we are on our knees with suffering until we are compelled to go inward and Heal our Karma by Unconditionally Loving the Infinite Light of God in our Spiritual Heart. 

It seems awful, but nightmares are awful and then you Wake Up and you forget them. We are being given just the Creation we need that will cause so much suffering in the external realm that we turn away from  seeking for transient happiness in the outer realm and instead go inward, heal our Karma, and reUnify back into Oneness with God to end these countless lifetimes of Karmic manifestation. 

We do not have freewill in that way we think we do. In Truth it's the Spirit our Higher Self embodied within that drives the Chariot. Our freewill is our inner relationship with our Self - whether we attach to the outer realm or whether we turn inward and Seek for the Light of God in our Heart. The Dream is Vibrational. The more in Alignment we are with God in our Spiritual Heart the more Light we will experience in the Dream as oppose to shadows. 

If you dream of monsters and you fear them then the dream will proceed fearfully. But if you understand these Teachings and see through the monsters Form to their Wounded Nature and the Light of God in their Heart and Love them like You Love your Self then the Dream will Be a Good One and proceed with more Joy until your Love for God, the Infinite Light in your Heart becomes so Pure, that you Awaken from the dream of separation and Be as One with the Infinite Light of God again.

in the past week alone, ive seen the most angel numbers than i ever have in my life which i think is so cool. for example, i woke up at 4:44 am and i said ""huh, are the angels trying to tell me something"". as i said that, a box right next to me THAT HAS NEVER MOVED suddenly tipped over. kinda scared me but trying to stay positive haha.

spirituality,A &lt;1 minute exercise to connect with your feelings. All you need is a mirror,"Here's a quick experiment if you haven't tried mirror work before.

Let's do this one without too much thinking and rationalizing, OK?

It will be worth it, I promise.

Afterwards, drop a comment or hit reply to share how it felt.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before you do this mirror exercise

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself.   
Really, look into your eyes  
No preening, no posing
* Breathe slowly  
Unclench your jaw  
Ease your shoulders down  
Unclench your toes  

* One more breath

Now say to yourself:

&gt;I love you  
I am going to take care of you  
You're going to be OK

Yes, you can say it out loud.

No overthinking. Just do it.

&amp;#x200B;

# How did it feel?

How did you see yourself?

Did you feel any tenderness towards the face in the mirror?

Did it feel strange or emotional, or just indifferent?

I don't know about you, but I felt like crying. In a good way.

It felt emotional and tender. Like a step towards accepting and loving myself.

I saw myself as a little vulnerable, but felt lighter afterwards. Like I was going to be OK.

This must be said: If you haven‚Äôt made peace by acceptance and forgiveness of your inner-child traumas and/or Shadow, I recommend heading towards that direction as it will give you a full experience of clarity and saves you many of these questions being asked here. 
Because, once you are Fully Awakened;

‚Ä¢There are only questions and no living Soul on Earth can answer unless appointed through. 
‚Ä¢Sleep becomes irregular. Day/Night interchangeable. (Less Sleep, sensitivity heightens you light and interactions)
‚Ä¢Fasting, less or no fattening food. Eat clean, if possible. Salad is beautiful.  I would suggest on eating only what is needed for the day or activities.  Do not overindulged. 
‚Ä¢All senses will heightened into many levels and may get upgrades if on the right track. 
‚Ä¢IMPORTANCE:: SELF AWARENESS is vital. All thoughts creates energy, energy support life, life exist and existence become experiences. 
‚Ä¢Think Less, Feel More.  -&gt; Think none, Feel all.
‚Ä¢Meditation is Self-explanatory and if your Mind does not allow you to focus, it is not the location but where the Mind is located: Speak forth to the Mind, ‚ÄúDETACH‚Äù.  
‚Ä¢Freedom to speak by inner or outer. 
     Inner is appropriate settings would be in a meditating state where no commands are needed. 
     Outer is in opposite as Inner, best used to silence the lackadaisical Mind. Giving commands to tap into abilities of the Soul. 
‚Ä¢ A disciplined mind takes effort and forgiveness to Self. Feed it with compassion by giving your mind every opportunity to achieve the best results. 
Give appreciation to Self because before any other, you deserve it first. 
‚Ä¢3rd Eye activation creates a full sense of whole.

spirituality,Need help understanding post-awakening/psychosis after 1000mcg trip,"Back in April I had the brilliant idea of taking 2 double sided tabs of LSD and had a significantly different trip than I‚Äôd usually have, no resistance, no fighting within the mind, just a profoundly silencing trip. As I came up, everything started to melt around me my mind was desperate to find something to hang onto as it‚Äôs survivalistic self, as the anxiety set in I rushed upstairs and turned on Aaron Abke videos desperately looking for answers as everything my mind knew faded into oblivion as it‚Äôs finite self and finally 1 phrase clicked within on a significantly deeper level which was ‚ÄúYou are consciousness‚Äù...

As this phrase was stated and everything so rapidly moving and melting before my eyes(I was but 45 minutes into the trip) all came to a stop abruptly, there were no more hallucinations within my vision and I could see the physical world 10 fold of what I‚Äôve known it to be for so long. With this mental death of the personal narrative constantly going on within the mind something significantly deeper within, a higher knowing per say arose out of me and took over me, within all of my being and my conscious awareness it felt as if all I had known since I could remember was false, a intellectual understanding of the universe, not the pure experience of the universe itself. Even the pressures and feelings within my brian completely shut off as what there was left was pure unabridged awareness itself. As this realization intimately guided me into finally realizing that all of my issues and solidity within my perception of the world around me was all a doing of myself I began to correct the skewed habits my mind I gained through years of anxious oscillating thoughts about myself and who I am until I then was the creator.

This complete silence of my mind allowed for something higher than the person to arise from me, the intelligence I embodied felt as if my own intelligence wasn‚Äôt sabotaging myself anymore and was working for me on such a level I could morph into or do anything I wanted or needed to in the present moment without the mind telling me I was incapable of doing so. My IQ felt significantly higher as well as my EQ because I could sense and read every ounce of energy within my friends and others being and could connect with them on levels of depth I‚Äôve never been able to, to the point if I wanted to I could manipulate them if I truly wanted to at any given point in time yet I respected their boundaries and only wanted to help them heal from the past traumas that plague them to this as mine have. I also felt this steadfast and irrevocable presence as my conceptual understanding of time vanished with the past and future and time flew by as if hours were minutes because there was no concept of suffering anymore.

Eventually this awakened state had faded after roughly 60 days as a close friend of mine that had feelings for me really wanted to be with me and I didn‚Äôt feel the same and finally had given her a chance yet with this happening and not following how I truly felt turned my mind back on and was the catalyst to the deepest suffering I‚Äôve felt within my being, my mind reprimanded me and since I was playing with psychedelics my mind scorned me and isolated me by saying I was in the wrong, that I had lost it, I had gone psychotic, schizophrenic, completely delusional and by god were the first 3 months horrific as I had just seen a glimpse of true everlasting peace and then It was taken away from me, this soon became devastating and led me down a very dark path of coping by heavy drug use to numb what I was feeling which was mainly marijuana and alcohol. What destroyed me the most and what I believe the be the catalyst of this turning back on of the mind was how deeply I care about this person yet couldn‚Äôt admit it because I wanted to go and explore myself more because I never gave myself the allowance to do so and the deepest flaws of my human personality arose and haunted me for feeling these ways.

As time has moved along I‚Äôve completely stopped smoking marijuana as I see it only resets my progression and locks me within a heavy state of acceptance as well has heavily cutting back on alcohol as I only drink socially or to relax now without overdoing it, and progressively I‚Äôve been able to move out of the comfort zones the mind has created as solidity within my perception and I feel as if I‚Äôm slowly tuning back into this pure awareness again, as time goes on my mind will occasionally try and scare the living shit out of me by acting as if I am psychotic or something in between but I can wade past these attacks as simply letting it pass. 

I guess my question to you all is what the fuck was this or is this experience I‚Äôve gone through? It‚Äôs mind boggling the think I myself even had this experience at times as it almost feels as it was a dream at times because of how clearly I could see through all of the illusions of the mind. Am I on the right track or am I only leading myself down the wrong path even more? Is there any ways I can correct the stigma I‚Äôve created or shall I say the ego has created within my mind to label me as an outcast or isolated from the rest? Am I even making sense?

spirituality,I'm (21 F) a naturally brain fog/disconnected person and often love spending time alone in my void. When is it the right moment to push myself to interact in the physical world vs. taking the time out to disconnect and just be present in my void.

Its possible that essential workers can get access to be staying  in hotel rooms and im forever grateful for my circumstance. my mom is considering getting me that space bc ive told her ive had trouble just being in the house and getting college work done. The reason i spend so much time working, or physically out of the house is bc of my mental state, and it just allows me to not fall so far back into my disconnection by being with people/being forced to uphold deadlines. I can work at it.

But on a more spiritual level, I decided to end a *very* unhealthy relationship and a part of that was my  disconnection mentally, as well our physical one bc of quarantine. So Im grappling with using that space to fully isolate and get my mental state in order, being next to central park etc. &amp;  just expanding my mind within myself.

spirituality,Energy being pumped through the third eye,"It was brought to my attention recently that I might have an energy anchor in the third eye.

How did it happen?  
Over two and a half years ago I was concentrating on the third eye chakra, trying to open it. I probably persisted with that practice over the course of a year. One night while I was meditating on it, I felt some energy swirl around the third eye and then entering the center of the brain, where I felt an extremely sharp pain, followed by visions of galaxies and whatnot. It was horrible. I had trouble grounding myself for the next month. 

However, ever since then I can feel this energy coming through my third eye. It occupies my head, and sometimes the feeling might be too strong to handle, which translates into many unpleasant moments. It feels as if there is this hose connected to my third eye which constantly pumps out spiritual energy in my mind. 

Any idea what can I do with that energy? Or maybe if I can decrease this energy flow?",1590004441.0
spirituality,Third eye pulses,"Hi guys, I got this issue Id like to discuss. 

First, some background.

So I always used to be very influenced by my emotions, causing abundant mood swings while growing up. Then a few months after graduating from high school I sort of crafted my own philosophy based on mostly meditation, Buddhism and some own ideas to ensure that I would always have a mental/intellectual fallback line of sorts. It actually worked, and after a while I was able to lift my mood on command, or rather, to push away any negative feelings/thoughts on command. 
The distinct feeling I would get after getting rid of a counterproductive feeling/thought is hard to describe, but I'll try. It felt sort of like a powerful self-assuring energy pouring out the top of my head, which gave me strength and confidence. Later, I would ascribe this feeling to third eye activity.
After a while though, I lost this ability, and after a few months of trying to regain it by sheer force and willpower, I decided I needed another approach.

In comes spirituality, chakras and all that jazz, right around the start of 2020. Whereas I used to believe that life was hard work and maintenance in order to thrive, I now started to believe in love and acceptance. Ever since, I have been trying to accept all my underlying issues, but when I try to simply let everything be I have this instinctual reaction to push the oncoming negativity away by activating my third eye chakra, thereby stressing me out and causing pain in my head. These activations feel like pulses which keep being pushed back by an impenetrable wall around my head. I also experience the moment and feelings in general much more indirectly, and even though I'm less depressed than I used to be, I don't think the general numbness is worth a little less pain. 

If anyone has any advice on how to stop overthinking or on how to balance an overactive indigo chakra I would greatly appreciate it!!",1589991993.0

spirituality,Kabbalah 101,"Everything I know about Kabbalah in simple plain English

God has desires. And since he is all-powerful, every desire he has is fulfilled. Desires are things that are wanted. So every desire God has is a thing. If he desires it, it is created. When God creates, he is doing an action. And since he desires things, not actions, that simply means that actions are means of fulfilling desires. God fulfills his desire when he creates them. We are like God in that we also have desires. But since we can‚Äôt really create a soul, only a body, actions for us are means of attaining the things we desire. So we do have free will and are not controlled by God. God is omnipresent, and his creations are part of Him, (like a person‚Äôs desires are part of the person). Every soul (which is a desire God had) desires too, since it is made in God‚Äôs image. Your goal is to attain your desire. 

God gets everything he wants since his desires are always fulfilled. The only sin is therefore getting in the way of someone else‚Äôs pursuit of attaining their desire. Again, because we are made in His image.",1589610334.0

Translation:

 This bhajan is all about opposites , and inverse situations, circumstances, people, emotions created by God only. These opposites allows one to have full vision and experience between good and bad in life. These opposites are co existing and are there with the purpose. Kaka is saying-  God has created beautiful rose plant, and also put thorns on it and fragrance in the flower. God has created so many flowers with so many colours, and also put different fragrances in all flowers ( synonymous with people). He has put sand in harsh deserts, and  also put cooling water in lakes and rivers. He has put one under extreme heat, and also frozen one under extreme cold (synonymous with circumstances). He has created innocence in the eyes of deer, and also put monstrosity in wild animals. He has created many diseases, and also created many plants as medicines. He has given us heat from sunlight, and coolness from moonlight. He has created men with firm heart, and women with softer heart. He has created thieves and robbers, and also created saints. He created human by putting life in a statue of clay. He did all and  he is still hiding from everything.  Kaka is calling out for disappeared creator of this world.",1589607297.0
spirituality,"Cutting cords with every sexual partner, even casual?","I have a girlfriend who has broadened my knowledge to spiritual healing. It‚Äôs better helped me shape the person I am and am continuing to grow to be. Recently, my girlfriend has spoke on the practices of cosmic sexuality and intends to learn from it &amp; it‚Äôs teachings. She wants me to indulge with her as well but she states that I need to cut cords with every previous sexual encounter I‚Äôve ever had in my life.

We both have had multiple partners in the past. I‚Äôve had a more increasing number in relation to hers but all the same it‚Äôs still everything we‚Äôve moved on from and left in our past. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I don‚Äôt fully remember 4 out of the 10 partners I‚Äôve been with in my life. The other partners I‚Äôve been with I‚Äôve moved on from, with either physical &amp; emotional closure, the ability to cut all ties, thoughts and feelings towards them, &amp; everything in the middle. While with my current partner, none of my previous partners are to ever be a passing thought unless it‚Äôs mentioned/brought up. 

My current partner is dead set on me still having these cords with these people of my past when I‚Äôm well aware of my involvement with them, and how I‚Äôve been able to emotionally and mentally move on from them. Is there a way for me to still remove these cords I don‚Äôt even see or feel with not only the partners I do remember, but the ones I don‚Äôt even  remember?

Second, I'm not trying to change their consciousness as I believe changing ourselves is the best way to move humanity forward.

Now that's out of the way, my question revolves more on how to respond to people who says things that are lower consciousness, and what to do if they twisted the context of spirituality terms?

spirituality,I really need help on this,"I had recently been awakened and during this time I‚Äôve been loosing friends. But I am having a hard time with my bestfriend. I see everyone as God because we all are so I started hanging out with her ex boyfriend because he understood me better. That got her mad and hurt( I apologized and it is valid) but I can‚Äôt exercise the culture reality or movies have been putting on us because I don‚Äôt believe in it any more. I have told her that I‚Äôm there whenever she‚Äôs ready to heal from the situation and be friends again. I drove to her(11 hours, its my 3rd time coming) to spend time with her during quarantine. That‚Äôs where my awakening started to hit. When I got back, I had asked her to visit me before changing my place because it means so much to me to see the first place I ever got. She said she didn‚Äôt want to risk it and said no. I thought I was cool with it and focused on apologizing to her and loving her unconditionally but it really hurt me. I explained it for her but she got way defensive and hit me with facts about how dangerous it is to travel at this time. I understand, really but it still hurts. 

So whenever I meditate, I keep getting negative thoughts about her that I do not want. Manifesting is close to my natural ability and I don‚Äôt want it to mess with my reality anymore. Please help me with spiritual guidance. I tried talking to her, treat her like God-like, and accept the situation.

spirituality,"You are the ultimate state, you are the universal consciousness, you are free and pure!"," 

You are that state. It is when you go into meditation not expecting anything that life reveals its juice to you, consciousness reveals itself when no expectations are put on it, and you are able to sit with it in silent, acknowledging it and loving it, honoring it, valuing and treasuring it. When these moments of clarity appear, you must drop everything and be with it, and never let go. If you do not let go of the clarity, it will not let go of you. Thoughts might appear, emotions and sensations might appear, but they appear in the consciousness that you are. You can simply ignore completely all doubt and fear and thought and know you are that peace itself. In the moment of truth there is no one to experience it, there is only truth itself awoken to itself.

It is because you believe you are separate from it, that you then ""try to reach it"" and then you inevitably fail, for the one who is trying to reach it will never reach it, only the truth can be the truth, a thought which you identify as, can never be and see the truth. It is only when the thought is dropped and you stay as you are, pure awareness, that truth is clearly seen.

What is out of tune is not yourself, but merely a thought. The thought believes it is out of tune, and then consciousness believes it, and then it appears as if consciousness is out of tune. That is false. The truth is ever-present, simply drop thought and be the truth. Thought is just limiting yourself. You are unbound. The thought is in constant battle with itself, the truth is completely serene, peaceful, loving, joyful and compassionate in this moment also. The truth of you has nothing to do with whatever the thought is talking about. Let the thought do its thing and just ignore it completely my love. The holy spirit is seeking you dearly and wants you to come to self-realization of yourself, so you will be able to eternally effortlessly live in gods arms. Help the holy spirit by surrendering all thought and simply being. No expectations, just unconditional love to the peace that is ever-present, how dear it is, how precious it is, how blessed we are for being what we are! It is absolutely magnificent. Praise the lord, bless you.",1588693992.0

spirituality,Copy cats are always mediocre.,"Think of anyone who has done anything meaningful in this world... for better or for worse.  You will find that none of them were copy cats.

Let's start at the bad end of the spectrum.  Adolf Hitler.  History's biggest douche.  But the man had vision.  He knew how to rally people.  He saw an opportunity and ran with it.  Same with Donald Trump.  Trump says what he wants, does what he wants, doesn't care about following a script.  He's an asshole, but he's unique.

Don't get me wrong though.  I'm not saying we should aspire to be like these people.  I'm just illustrating a point.  Let's go to the good end of the spectrum.

Jesus.  He rebelled against the Jews, the pharisees, the whole establishment.  The man was totally unique.  The Buddha.  He's the guy we all reference.  The big kahuna.  But before the Buddha, who was there?  Surely there was somebody, but none just like him.  And Buddha didn't make the impact that he did by following his predecessors blindly.  Socrates.  Like Jesus, they killed him for being different.  But we don't remember the killers... we remember Socrates.

Martin Luther King.  Gandhi.  John Lennon.  Einstein.  So many examples of individuals.  Remember, **individuals**.

So why is that the rest of us become Buddhists?   Or perhaps worse, Christians?  Why is it that we feel we must depend upon a teacher?  Why do we need groups and dogmas and constant guidance?  Do you think Buddha needed that?  Do you think Jesus needed that?  Do you think Einstein would have contributed what he did to science if he had decided to be a monk?  Or imagine Lennon if he didn't make music.  Can you?

The greatest men, those who make the biggest difference in our world, are never copy cats.  Copy cats are always mediocre.

The sad thing is that the bad folk like Hitler and Trump just don't give a shit.  Maybe us good folk are afraid to impose ourselves a little bit.  Afraid to give a little heat.  Take a little heat.  Stir things up a bit.  That's why the bad folk keep winning out.  Cus us good folk are too busy being so god damn polite.

I'm not saying we can't learn from one another.  We can, and we should.  But our greatest gifts are always, always, those that we are born with.

Because remember: the bee in the nest made no honey, and the bird in the hive sang no song.

If your life is mediocre, maybe it's not because you're not ""doing it right"", or ""not trying hard enough"".  Maybe you're just  putting your energy in the wrong place.

But I guess there comes a point when you decide, fuck it man.  I'm going to believe in myself.  I'm going to do what I want to do.  And I really don't give a shit if anyone else has a problem with it.  It's my life.  And maybe, just maybe, others will be inspired, too.

Be well, folks.",1588204355.0
spirituality,Im interacting with spirits as I type this,"Hello good people of the spirutal community. The first time meet these spirits I made a post on here saying I was being touched by wierd transparent spirits, and now they are back. On my last post this guy responded to me and apparently the same thing has happened to him a few times. I tried sage, incense, mantras, talking to them, asking for help but these spirits don't care about anything. First I felt 2 really warm and soft hands what feels like it's made out clouds on my legs and crouch area, then I start to see these wierd and fast little buggers litarly ALL OVER THE PLACE, I think I somehow manage to step in to some sort of a limbo state where these spirits live, I am in the same world but only with things to hard to describe flying everywhere . I asked when they came just now if they are good or bad but I didn't get anything. The first time I was really scared because I didn't know what was going on and I had this spirit following me around and he (it feels like a male) was/is really interested in have sex with me. I can't get rid of him so I just let him stay in my crouch area, he's ""hands"" feels really warm and soft and I will not ingage in any sexuall activity with an unknowning spirit.

I really hope someone who reads this have a idea or clue on what I'm talking about cus I need to know if I should be worried or not.

Our whole fucking lives the nasa and holy see have programmed us and our parents and generational trauma and ravaged our ancestors through division and conquering strategy for what?! TO SEE HUMANS, human capital is the most profitable and YES I MEAN SLAVES WHETHER PROSTITUTION OR CONSUMING THEIR BLOOD. ARE YOU PEOPLE TOO BLIND TO SEE THAT ALL CELEBS AND ANY FUCKING PERSON ON TV NEVER TALKS ONLY ABOUT OUR CREATOR ALONE?!?????!!!!!

Just one experience was enough to change everything...

just 10 mins is all it took. just 10 mins and all the visions of all the things inside, thoughts, desires, feelings, emotions, ideas, all in their own substance and how they penetrate from higher planes to our plane\*\*\*\*\*\*, then came the light sparks in the physical vision, like an asteroid shower, from a higher plane or some inner plane it came like small sparks of lights as they hit the material world\*\*\*\*\*\*, they burned and burst.

Now if I stay silent for a few minutes I can see the whole scene in front morphing and shifting and breathing, like some people who take those hard drugs, i dont need them i can just see it in silence now, not eyes closed, eyes open! although I have used many organic herbs before

spirituality,"For those who believe in God or not believe, it is simply an idea to seek relief by believing or rejecting. Thus all inquiry is stopped."," Life has not moved an inch away from accidents, diseases, losses despite advances in technology and other economic and scientific innovations. Death is still an enigma despite the fact that we have accepted it as inevitable.

To explore this is fundamental inquiry.

The world arises by your being conscious of it. You and the world is a singular process, is the Total Field.

Senses see, touch, listen and so on, breathing in and out is going on, there is memory and imagination and thoughts arising in the mind. Anger, fear, anxiety, happiness are the expressions of Life to keep the mind alive. This is the format of Life.

Even the idea of God or ‚Äòwho created this Universe‚Äô arises as thinking, that is, within this format.

But how life is operated?

This is again thinking. The life process is from moment to moment which includes your memory, imagination, thinking.

What you feel - sadness, happiness, confusion, irritation and so on, it is all within the process. You can not run away from what you experience. The error has entered the human mind that it should stay pleased, relieved all the time. The idea of God is also used as a relief seeking device. Thus all inquiry is stopped. For those who believe or not believe, it is simply becomes an idea to seek relief by believing or rejecting.

New weekend, new brainwaves for you to enjoy.

Welcome to this astral projection meditation music odyssey. 963Hz to activate your pineal gland, imbued with 0.5Hz epsilon waves to enter a phenomenal state of consciousness. Enter the astral realm.

Please do not hesitate to ask me about anything in the comment section, as I would also like to get some proper feedback on the content.

If you find any value in my content, please do consider subscribing to my channel. You will find a vast spectre of both lucid dreaming, astral projection and out of body experience music that are imbued with isochronics, binaural waves, monaurals and solfeggio frequencies. There is also guided meditations for astral projection and lucid dreaming.

**EPSILON WAVES (0.1Hz to 0.5Hz)**

The Epsilon waves are very low-frequency, below that of delta waves which start at 0.5Hz. To give you an idea of just how low that is, most electroencephalogram (EEG) devices are not able to measure below 0.5 Hz.

The so-called Epsilon state is associated with ‚Äòsuspended animation'; a state where you're alive but with no obvious signs ‚Äì so no perceivable heartbeat, respiration or pulse. It is said that some yogis and meditation masters are able to achieve this state.

The benefit of accessing the Epsilon state is purported to be an extraordinary state of consciousness, one of a much higher awareness, and perhaps one of suspended animation.

**963HZ FREQUENCY(PINEAL GLAND ACTIVATOR)**

The 963 Hz frequency is connected with the Light, and enables direct experience with Spirit, or the non-vibrational energies of the spiritual world.

It is associated with the Crown Chakra/Sahasrara and recognized as the Pineal Activator or ‚ÄòThird Eye‚Äô to higher dimensions.

963Hz has long been identified as one of the ancient healing frequencies of the Solfeggio to help heal body, mind and soul. This frequency re-connects you with the Spirit, or the non-vibrational energies of the spiritual world. It will enable you to experience Oneness; our true nature.

I hope you have a pleasant experience listening to it. **Travel safe!**

spirituality,Who am I?,"When someone ask a simple question,

who are you?¬†means I have to give the answer of ""who am I?""

We give the answer like I am a person having a height of 5 8"", black hair, brown eyes &amp; who have that much wealth and give lot of information in the answer but if you go deeply in the answer then you can see that it is the answer of ""how I am?""¬†not ""who am I ?""¬†because the answer give the information of things associated with you but not about you.


The hair,eyes,wealth &amp; name these things are associated with us are either temporary or permanent.


For example¬†hair,eyes are temporary associated with us because these are the things that changes¬†continuously with respect to what we drink and eat¬† but name is permanently associated with us.

These are like¬†signboard¬†that indicates toward a reality that is you. Aditya is a name that is like a signboard indicates toward a reality that who I am but name itself is not a reality.


So the question arises who really I am?


Am I body or mind or am I the combination of both.


Let's discover who really we are? But before that we try to understand a basic fundamental principle¬†"" If something is changing the person or entity who knows about change must not be changing i.e constant"".


To develope complete understanding of this principle we go through a story.


A 5-floors building was constructed in a city every floor is constructed by different engineer but the junior engineer is same for all 5 floors.

After construction inspection officer came for inspection of building ask some questions about the construction of 1st floor to engineer A then ask questions about 2 floor to A but engineer A don't know the answer so engineer B came to site and give the answer then inspection officer ask about 3rd floor then same problem arises engineer B don't know the answer then in between, junior engineer came &amp; said that I know everything about all 5 floors but engineer didn't because when this building in construction engineers are changing with respect to floor so they don't know about all floors but junior engineer was not changing with respect to floors so I know about whole change(whole construction) so you can ask any question to me I hope this story help you that principle that¬†""change is only recorded or experience by the entity or person who itself not changing.""


Consider I am a body and we know that body is continuously changing with respect to what we eat and drink this means that I am not a body because body is changing and I am that constant thing or entity who know that change.


We also consider that is we are mind obviously answer is no because we also know that mind is also changing every moment of time so we are the constant entity that knows the change of body &amp; mind.",1584555822.0

We know universe is equal for everyone, It does no injustice with anybody.  
But you know whatever we do, how much spiritual we become we still kill thousands (millions maybe) living beings daily they are small but they do exist is not that an injustice?  
Here is my question Do actually ""I"" exist  and rest are just like NPC? since life is a playground of learning why would Universe involve killing and suffering for real(maybe a trick/projection to teach us)?   
The day I took the substance , every inch every single thing expanded into infinite numbers of dimension/directions which is not possible to grasp for normal human being, I was speechless back then how is that even possible!!  


Then the question arise in my mind that if it is possible then (living beings) if ""I"" the only one who is real and you all are just like NPC. And to you , you are the reality and I am NPC, in your reality you might find me in pain/suffer however I am doing fine from my reality, your's and mine both reality are true and running together but in a different world/dimension, because I don't believe universe just bring us here to suffer(don't say life is joyful we are not just aware of it!, It is not actually, you are just thinking about humans)! It's complicated to understand but some people can understand this , so I am expecting answers from them.  


I am saying this question because it's easier to say spiritual words or maybe doing spiritual stuffs but who suffers from liver, kidney or brain disease and always in pain it's tough, it's really tough for them to concentrate such stuffs.   or we have to admit that  killing a living being is not a bad karma/sin  whether it is a human or any other animal",1583854747.0

spirituality,"Why aren't so many occultists terrified at casually summoning monstrous looking creatures? Even treating them like a next door neighbor? Despite for a large number of people, its their first attempt ever at evocation? Normal people would flee in fear!","I saw this post on a discord chat.

&gt;Literally Baou demon dad called ""murder"" when I described your method of killing demons. As did other occultists on discord and reddit. Baou and others believes demons are sentinel beings with real minds and thus you should treat them with common courtesy.

&gt;And in addition they insisted on humans being equal when I stated (not from your statement but from the bible and Bass's post) humans are god's greatest creation.......

&gt;You know how all that went. But since you mentioned how fucked up people in the subculture when they will treat demons better than a fellow stranger human......

&gt;Bass always state you wouldn't let a random human into your home or give him your personal info. You'd be skeptical with what a stranger tells you. So why shouldn't you do the same with demons and spirits? He got publicly chewed out........

&gt;But even if I was an atheist, he's right. Why would you trust a random sent creature who just pops up one day? Why would you trust a troll that came out when you played with a summoning ritual? These guys are talking about meeting some random horned ugly and ferocious looking monster on a summoning (even knowing the texts calls them dangerous and violent)!!!!!

&gt;At least in my case the book said the entity will help find women and it appeared in a human form that had a dead drop gorgeous face comparable to Audrey Hepburn and was in fancy clothing and spoke with an aristocratic tongue and moved with a sophisticated air. I'm not denying I was a fucking moron but at least it looked like a normal human.

&gt;These idiots will insist on befriending a motherfucking talking wolf or an alligator in heavy plate armor with a large ass sword? Forget how dangerous the texts describe them, their appearance alone is scary as fuck and obviously bloodthirsty!

&gt;But they will treat them better than their real life acquaintances or even friends (I wish I was making this up)!!!! Forget that they were even insisting on treated them better than your relatives (I really wish I was fucking making that up!!!)!!!! Even Baou Demon Dad didn't go that far an insisted on boundaries as well as sigils and other wards and defenses even after you got to know a demon well and developed a ""deep friendship"".....

&gt;But that was so common on reddit and discord.

&gt;I do have to say though the willingness to curse others on the internet while treating demons like they are the President was one of the most insane things i ever soon....... But treating a demon like your blood brother irl?..................

&gt;I'll just stop here. But your comments about never feeding the bears makes me wonder how the fuck anyone can immediately befriend a giant bird wielding a sword or a talking bear (one person literally summoned this kind of demon lol) but rebel against their parents irl and neglect their siblings!

&gt;Why the fuck would you talk to a talking bear who suddenly comes out of a circle like he's your friend if its yoru first time summoning?!!!!

In addition the same user also posted this in the chatroom.

&gt;If you were a normal human who never knew shit of the occult, I am curious if you'd be scared if an upright standing talking giant horse like Orobas is traditionall drawn as?

&gt;Am I nuts in believing normal people would run out of their home screming as fast as they can run if they suddenly saw a talking wolf with wings appear in the middle of a circle because they attempted summoning Marchosias?

&gt;Like I said at least the false goddess Aeval appeard like a real beauty pageant queen and unmistakably human. These guys are not scared of the fact that a talking 10 feet tall talking Bear just appeared in front of them with a deep glutteral voice after repeating some poetry?

A few other discorders gave their responses.

&gt;It is all crazy, isn't it? Especially considering a strange human at least thinks like you, and has the same body. Demons... well... most people don't understand just how ""different"" they are.

&gt;Ant spiders, man. Ant spiders.

Another person wrote a longer reply.

&gt;Uh, yeah. I still get scared of things I've seen a lot. There used to be a joke between myself and my former student, and again between myself and my teacher, that you just have to give up the scare sometimes... There was a thing a 3rd category entity would do for the longest time... Press its face to the window and look in on whoever was in the room. We all knew it did it, we knew the noise of the face hitting the screen... we habitually drew the blinds at dusk to avoid it, but once in a while we'd forget, hear that noise, and reflexively turn to look... And the sonnuvabitch was so creepy it would be the routine of jumping out of the skin, shouting a stream of nonsense/making up brand new profanity, nope-ing right the hell out of the room to regain composure.

&gt;How people who have little experience can be comfortable with the things they describe, especially when there is no previous contact (let alone familiarity)... Honestly, I imagine some people are just like that, because some people are just strange and/or it fits within whatever belief system they've decided to adopt, and the majority of the rest are probably full of shit. In real life, creepy stuff that you can tolerate on a movie screen is very different, and if you've ever been baited into one of the ""pop-up scare"" things somewhere online, having that happen for real in front of your face... Most of the time the reaction is reflexive, regardless of experience.

&gt;That story about the hammer flying and missing me by a hair, and my deadpan reaction that Bass thought was hilarious... That is a funny little thing to tell (moreso when we were still able to see eye to eye and get a mutual laugh, but still) but in reality it isn't a good sign at all. It means I had been stuck in a situation that was so bad for so long flying hammers were no longer a reason for pause. Not good for me personally, and indicative of a very not-good situation.

&gt;If you legitimately have a giant, bipedal, talking horse demon waltz into your living room and your reaction is ""Hey, sup?"" you really need to take a break and back off the occult shit for a while... Your reality has become totally skewed.

Different people made the following posts.

One stated.

&gt; The first thing I'd do summoning and meeting a talking bear is to gset up an appointment to a psychiatry clinic the next day I can understand if its a regular human that popped up Esp if its a beauty pageant queen like in my case But a talking bear? :laughing: Nevermind an alligator wearing heavy plate armor with a large ass sword with a scry deep voice

Another stated.

&gt; LOL Normal people would run away the moment they see a talking biird holding a curved sword ona wolf like Andras They were literally bragging how badass Andras was rather than being fucking scared like hell and running away from their house ASAP in their first summoning At least in my case my first summoning had fairy that looked like a REGULAR HUMAN BEING With a dead drop gorgeous face and in fancy aristocratic clothing Far cry from summoning a talking bear And thinking its your friend

One poster replied.

&gt;Isn't this psychology among occultists fucking insane? BTW Duelist Larg is my Discord handle ;). But still trusting a talking three headed demons like Asmodeus as friendly as you would meeting a classmate? Fucking insane!

The last thing I saw on the discord chat before leaving was this.

&gt;Shit man if it weren't for the fact I've had 'don't run it will chase' drilled into my skull I'd be constantly running and I'm someone who has been around when the big bad shit comes out to play. Seriously though, probably 100 percent of stuff most people will come across is malicious and predatory, its fine to retreat, but never out right run. anything will immediately see weakness and think prey and come after you. I am very out of practice, most of my skill and even some knowledge i had has wasted away and slipped out of my head like sand though fingers, but unless something is around that top tier of evil I'm not going to be scared of it? I get attacked or messed with in my dreams every so often. I cant and never have been able to leave my body, dreaming is probably the point where I'm a little out or more susceptible to things coming at me. Those violent dreams are me kicking things around and booting them out of my space. I can still kick ass if i need to, so unless its something thats pretty strong I'm ok. I mean don't get me wrong there are things that come around still that make me shake in my boots (aka the things that make me want to run somethimes). Demons can be silver tongued and charming as hell, but its all a lie and they are evil and will fuck you over. Also correction to a previous response of mine about evocation, again knowledge is escaping me as i continue to be dormant for the most part, i was talking to dear and what we did is not evocation, so no, i do not do evocation.

So I'd have to ask................. All the people above (more than 5 different users chatting real time in the discord room) state how common it is for people in occultic arts to treat meeting an apparition like a snarling  Medusa spirit like its nothing special....... Like they're just meeting their best friend in the park in a planned chilling walk to the mall where they will shop for stuff for the entire Friday afternoon...............

I personally witnessed it too many times how people post on reddit and discord how excited they will be to meet a genie again for the 12th time this month or how they treat a 7 feet tall goatman with a mace in his hands like its their best friends............

In some case its the first time summoning anything but they already are saying ""hi buddy!"" after the evocation was successful and sphinx pops out of thin air...........

The discord users have a point. Normal people would be running away in terror out of their apartments for their life if they were playing around summoning a lamassu and one suddenly pop up. As one of the above posters wrote, you wouldn't trust a stranger you just met suddenly knocking on your door the next day and asking you out (esp if you never gave them your address, or not even your phone number)........... So why would you trust to allow a random ghost or spirit esp one that looks like a beast (esp if it holds a weapon) into your home at its own whim? Why would you be excited to keep on summoning to meet Horus everyday like you are meeting your girlfriend next day since not only Horus have the head of a bird but he's the freaking king of Egypt! Even if you don't fear spirits, the fact he's the monarch of a kingdom should mean you should be hesitant to keep contacting him daily! You wouldn't call President Trump everyday on the phone to talk to him over petty matters would you? So you're gonna treat a god who's the king of an ancient civilization (not mention head of a whole pantheon or at least its ceremonial representative) like he's a classmate at school and call him everyday?

I mean on Discord I chatted with veteran Satanists and Wiccans and they say its summoning anything is very dangerous and you should always be prepped and treat it not like a game but like a life or death thing. So its telling even people who worship Satan recognize its not a weekend hobby for ****s and giggles.

Yet all across reddit and esp discord people say they keep summoning an animal ancestor who's a talking bear without any fear of the dangers and talking to Pazuzu like he's an everyday Joe (ignoring Pazuzu was one of the MOST POWERFUL demons in Mesopotamia,one known to kill people without remorse and is a freaking monster with wings and a snake penis!!!)!

I get if say you summon Aphrodite and keep communicating with her everyday like she's your auntie on the phone line or you keep summoning the mother goddess Danu for advice. They practically all are humans enhanced with magical powers. As one of the posters stated, the disguised demon or whatever evil spirit it was at least looked like beauty pageant queen.

You're gonna treat a talking creature with the head of a lion and five human legs like he's your psychiatrist despite the fact its not only your first time summoning Buer but its the first time you attempted evocation ever period in your life? And you're gonna treat it like a normal even like meeting a marine recruiter at your school? Whats the logic in that?",1583519677.0

spirituality,A recent insight I had about death,"I realized that the only reason we are afraid to die is we don't want to lose this identity we've spent our entire life creating. To die is to let go of everything that made us who we are in this lifetime...even the core identity of being human. I had an insight that the concepts of life and death, before and after, good and bad, etc. are all human created, and part of death is letting go of these concepts because we completely cease the identity of being human when we die. 

To even realize that we are alive, we must have some form of identity that allows us to think ""ok, here I am, I'm alive."" If somehow you let go of the concepts of life and death, would you ever really die? If your consciousness becomes truly formless, like what many people experience on ego death in psychedelics, could you consider yourself alive anymore? Would you ever die?

Yea, you have a steering wheel -- just like those ones on the little red fire engines outside the grocery store that cost 50 cents to ride on.

Follow the logic:

If there is any pre-determination, it is ALL predetermined. Can't possibly or logically have both predetermination and freewill-freeplay in the movie. Predetermination means a story has been conceived. Even one moment of freewill-freeplay would allow someone to kill their self or someone else ""off script"" and it would have a domino effect to the entire story.

We have freewill-freeplay as perfect spirits before the Big Bang: That's where/when we conceive &amp; plan &amp; predetermine the story. Once the story begins (Big Bang/Mortal Birth) the story/ride is locked and there is no freewill-freeplay.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRANSLATION**

**16.11-12: They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.**

**16.13-15:The demoniac person thinks: ""So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice."" In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.**

&amp;#x200B;

**PURPORT(16.11-12)**

The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to one's karma, or activities in this world. Their plans for life are never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality, who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man's desire. The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.

The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic literature, theUpani·π£ads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences.

**Question 1 : Why a demoniac person feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences ?**

Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as deva prak·πõti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.

The word abhijƒÅtasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as GarbhƒÅdhƒÅna-sa·πÅskƒÅra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being. In Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Those who are in K·πõ·π£·πáaconsciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.

The social institution known as var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma-the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes-is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world. In the var·πáƒÅ≈õrama institution the sannyƒÅsƒ´, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. AbrƒÅhma·πáa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k·π£atriyas, the vai≈õyas and the≈õ≈´dras, but a sannyƒÅsƒ´, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the brƒÅhma·πáas also. For asannyƒÅsƒ´, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyƒÅsƒ´ has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, ""After leaving my connections, who will protect me?"" he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K·πõ·π£·πáa or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ is always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that K·πõ·π£·πáa as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. ""I shall never be alone,"" one should think. ""Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K·πõ·π£·πáa, and He will give me all protection."" That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sannyƒÅsƒ´ is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyƒÅsƒ´, and when He was at Purƒ´ His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyƒÅsƒ´ not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyƒÅsƒ´, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyƒÅsƒ´ was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannyƒÅsa order of the life in connection with association with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Cho·π≠a HaridƒÅsa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho·π≠a HaridƒÅsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, ""For a sannyƒÅsƒ´ or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification-not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity-is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires."" So these are the processes for purification.

The next item is j√±ƒÅna-yoga-vyavasthiti·∏•: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. SannyƒÅsƒ´ life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sannyƒÅsƒ´ is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyƒÅsƒ´ goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. This is the duty of a sannyƒÅsƒ´. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach K·πõ·π£·πáa with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyƒÅsƒ´ or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa·πÅ≈õuddhi·∏• (purity) and j√±ƒÅna-yoga (knowledge).

The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K·πõsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.

Then as far as dama·∏• (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K·πõ·π£·πáa. If he is able to beget children who will be in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.

Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya, the vƒÅnaprastha and sannyƒÅsa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a, the chanting of Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/Hare RƒÅma,Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.

Then svƒÅdhyƒÅya·∏•, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and ƒÅrjavam, gentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. BrahmacƒÅrƒ´s should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called svƒÅdhyƒÅya·∏•. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya, g·πõhastha, vƒÅnaprastha and sannyƒÅsa. So after g·πõhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasyƒÅ. The entire var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma society is meant for tapasyƒÅ.Without tapasyƒÅ or austerity no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don't restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.

As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in thebrahmacarya-ƒÅ≈õrama, or g·πõhastha-ƒÅ≈õrama or vƒÅnaprastha-ƒÅ≈õrama. One must live very simply.

Ahi·πÅsƒÅ means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi·πÅsƒÅ means not checking anyone's progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one's palate. This is called ahi·πÅsƒÅ.

Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding Vedas. ≈öruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.

Akrodha·∏• means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai≈õunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hrƒ´·∏•means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. AcƒÅpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word teja·∏• used here is meant for the k·π£atriyas. The k·π£atriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.

≈öaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one's dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. NƒÅtimƒÅnitƒÅ, not expecting honor, applies to the ≈õ≈´dras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the ≈õ≈´dras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.

All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.

spirituality,Weird trilogy,"I. A good bit of time ago, in 2015, I was, through a little practice, able to sense and feel my body's magnetic field and the energy that permeates myself and everyone else. I could control what ""vibe"" so to speak I put out, so long as it was true to my stream of consciousness. I could display a variety of colors, emotions, and intent, through only touch. unfortunately, time were tough while I was a logger working with a sociopath and my best friend. The sociopath was my best friend's father. They were also both spiritually aware. Well, we can skip ahead a little. I was in a bad place and feeling insecure about my ability to defend myself and the ones I love. I made myself a beacon to be communed with by anything evil, powerful, and willing to make a deal. I made the mistake of offering the one who answered the call the ability to feed off my considerable well of energy in exchange for the strength to fight off any physical threats that may come my way. Time went on and i forgot about it. 

II. I had a some verbal altercations. This started just with friends. It eventually boiled over to me having an argument with a friend and I reacted too harshly. I immediately recalled the drunken deal I had made. I was certain that the parameters of this contract were not what I thought they were and I wanted out. That's when the creepy shit started. I would be on long drives on country roads and I could swear the whole time that someone was pressed up against the back of the driver's seat of my car and holding a knife to my neck. I knew who it was too. The presence was familiar. At least at that time, the entity didn't have any control over me. We were separate. I would feel that familiar dread in unexpected places and at different distances. This went on for some time, but it slowly waned until it seemed to cease.

III. About six months down the road from making the ""deal"", I was at a particularly low point. I was no longer a Logger. after a brief stint couch surfing, I found myself working as an electrical apprentice, living with a family of alcoholic gypsies. I laid my head down to rest in the trailer between the barn and the house. I had been staying there for at least a few months by this time. I got mildly intoxicated with my ""roommates"" and decided, as I usually did, to call it an early night. Just as I began to fall asleep, I could swear I felt that familiar malevolent presence hit my toes and slowly creep up. It began consuming more and more of me. It was at my shoulders now and in my passive state, it crept up my neck, and across the bass of my skull. When it reached the crown of my head, something amazing happened. At what seemed like the exact moment I was both about to be fully taken and fall asleep, a blinding gold and white presence touched the last iota of me. It commanded my entire field of view. I pushed back the darkness in a manor that seemed effortless. it pushed past my toes at whatever had been trying to take advantage of my weakened position for eradicated from the room. As soon as it was done I fell into a deep sleep. I woke the next morning an I felt strong; ready for anything. I threw on my work clothes and gathered the necessary tools for the day and opened the door of my trailer. I looked down to the step and saw a white feather, front and center. I was in shock for a moment, but I went about my day. I didn't feel anything from the malicious entity for quite a while after that.

So, I know this sounds bat shit crazy, but it is true to what I experienced. I left a multitude of details out and I also left out my theories about what I think really happened. If you have any questions, just ask. Sorry, I'm not a good writer. typos may be abundant.

TL;DR I made a deal with a dark entity, eventually rejected it, and then was saved by some other entity in my darkest hour.",1578382696.0

spirituality,A deciple's lesson,"Want to share a field report that I pray can be useful to the members here.

We are visiting NYC for the holidays and as I'm sure you can imagine and have seen, there are many homeless in the city. Particularly on the subways as it is a very great point of access to a captive audience.

I have a pretty strict rule with homeless, as I can become quite empathetic; if there is a way I can be certain to help, I will. Generally, this means giving food, clean water, or running them through a store for a day of groceries. I do not give cash as I don't want to support addiction.

Today, a man of able body and youth (25-30) got on our subway car, Peter. In our visit so far, if someone pipes up on the subway, it is to collect pocket change. Peter called for attention as he's probably done all day.

""Excuse me everyone, my name is Peter. I'm sorry to bother you today, but it is Sunday and I need your help. I am living on the streets, in the subway. I am trying hard to get a job, but as you can imagine, I don't have a shower, I don't have a phone, and I can't print a resume.""

Something whispered internally, 'keep his gaze,' and I listen to my intuition. While he continues, he and I share moments of direct eye contact:

""It is difficult, it feels impossible for anyone to give me a chance, I struggle to go on, and I am alone. But if you can give, even pennies, pennies put food in my stomach and confidence for tomorrow. Thank you so much, and God bless.""

And so, the deep whispers again, 'carry him and tell him to keep his head high.' A man hands Peter a few singles and Peter makes his way past my wife toward me. We lock eyes and as he passes I touch him a sec and say, ""I have no money to give, but keep your head high as a change is coming, and God bless you too."" We break eye contact as he passes and he says, ""Thank you, it means so much to hear that."" I'm hardly composed anymore. 

We're off at the next stop. I try to catch Peter's glance again but he's already moved onto the next car. Walking out into the city air, I'm hit with the gravity of the burden asked to carry out of the bowels of the rail line. Tears fill my eyes and my wife asks if I'm okay. I ask her to give me a few minutes, as she understands.

A quick prayer, ""Spirit, please bless and release the burden that I carry up for Peter out of the underground. Let him carry some of my hope, optimism, blessings, and promise of a better tomorrow, and let me carry out and release his dispair, disregard, shame, and potential addiction. Give it, him, and I love and release the burden of these weights.""

I know addiction, I know it's side effects, and to a small but tolerable degree, I empathically carried a little of that sting all day, the demon of it in my mind, but such to let it release far away from Peter and the crowds of fellow unassuming tourists.

But, here's the lesson, the growth for me; Peter, for a moment in eye contact, was not that homeless man, but Peter, the deciple to Jesus. He looked at me and dared me to embody the lesson of the living Christ to say, ""Tell me it will be okay, even if you are uncertain and terrified yourself. Lend me your strength, and carry my sin a moment."" Peter was the teacher for my growth in a deeper understanding of wwjd?

To even have a chance encounter of a shared moment, a transfer of energetic frequency, a second of humanity between one another shook me all day long. It shook me to tears and I'm up in the middle of the night retelling the encounter for you.

Sometimes a deciple, a Peter, comes across our path in an unconventional way and asks us to look within and feel a little bit of Christ ourselves, even if and especially when it is really hard. For in that moment of connection, we say to another, ""You are not alone, even if in the struggles.""

**TRANSLATION**

**One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies and who understands that neither the soul nor the Supersoul is ever destroyed, actually sees.**

&amp;#x200B;

**PURPORT**

Anyone who can see three things-the body, the proprietor of the body, or individual soul, and the friend of the individual soul, combined together by good association-is actually in knowledge. Those who are not associated with the soul's friend are ignorant; they simply see the body, and when the body is destroyed they think that everything is finished, but actually it is not so. After the destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving and unmoving forms. The Sanskrit word parame≈õvaram is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the soul is the master of the body, and after the destruction of the body he transfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who interpret this parame≈õvaram to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed. One who can see in this way can actually see what is happening.

**Question 1: What is the position of the Supersoul and the soul after the destruction of the body ? How one can know this ?**

spirituality,"""The Messiah will come Through the Internet"" (Redemption/ The Event/ Shift of Consciousness)","When the Lubavitcher Rebbe was first told about the internet when it began to gain popularity. He was informed about what it was and how it works. He had one thing to say: ‚ÄúThe Mashiach will come through the internet!‚Äù

	The internet is the primary way in which the world communicates and is connected today. Billions of people are using a handful of social media outlets to share their lives and connect with others. 

	While a surface-level examination of the internet and social media will lead one to believe that it‚Äôs mostly mundane interactions and expressions of people, the Lubavitcher Rebbe in his holy foresight saw a much deeper purpose.

	There is much filth that passes through these channels of communication. People use it to communicate hateful ideas and speech, boost their selfish image, and channel their lusts and desires, but the true purpose of these channels will be connected to Holiness and purity. 

	An example is that when a Creator created a road or highway, many people take advantage of it by using it. Criminals could use that certain as a getaway route after robbing a bank. Or an abusive husband could use that road every day as he travels to work. But the Creator does not appreciate those people using his road, even though he created it and allowed them to use it.

	The true delight of the Creator is when this imaginary road is used by righteous people to do righteous things. A righteous man who travels to give a lecture could be the entire purpose of the existence of that road. To carry the wisdom of the Creator. From that metaphor of the road‚Äôs true purpose, we can realize what is referred to as the purpose of the world.

	The purpose of the world to reveal the Creator. The nature of the world is that it hides the Creator's existence, meaning that from our perspective his existence and supervision are not revealed for all eyes to see. To keep this sort of hiddenness, the Creator must allow mundane activities and even unpleasantness to take place in the world to preserve His hiddenness. Therefore the purpose of everything in the world and the world itself won‚Äôt be known to all.

	This will all change when the Final Redemption comes. From the time of Redemption, everyone will know the entire purpose of the world and everything in it is to reveal the Creator.

	This brings us back to the true purpose of the internet and social media. If we realize that the purpose of the entire world and everything in it is to reveal the Creator, so too would that include all online mediums and outlets.

It simply means that the internet will be a way for people to connect to the wisdom that improves their lives and their inner connection to the Creator. It is a resource for education and connection to bring people to their personal redemption.

	Every soul has a different mission and responsibility in life. One soul may be responsible for freeing itself from sadness, while another soul must work on anger. Millions of people around the world need life-saving and soul watering content that is distributed on social media by honest people working for the good of humanity and the sake of the Creator.

	Some people have a hard time waking up in the morning because of the pressures of life. Others face extreme social anxiety to the point where going grocery shopping is a daunting task.

These are suffering souls who need a spiritual remedy. Their remedy comes through the internet. Through inspiring videos that teach them about positive self-esteem and the beauty of their souls, they begin to heal and shift for the good. This brings us from the practical and vital advice about Mashiach and the Final Redemption coming through the internet.

	While we dream and imagine ourselves wonderful fantasies such as the temple being rebuilt live-streamed for all to see, we have not reached that day upon the publication of this book. Those who are working for that day have work to do. 

	We have the powerful tools of social media at our fingertips. We are not only privileged but also responsible for using it for a good purpose, the ultimate purpose. Social media gives us the ability to reach hundreds, thousands, and in some cases many more people with relative ease. We have a responsibility for being a positive stream of influence on these channels to promote the search for truth. Whether sharing personal self-made posts and content or that of another which inspires you, we can reach those souls who need the light the most.

	At the click of a fingertip, we can share an inspiring video about faith to hundreds and thousands of our friends and followers. The light of the Creator can be brought through these channels of social media to heal and wake the souls of those who are suffering in painful and often unknown exile.

	Someone who has never thought seriously about the purpose of the world can be educated on the truth in five minutes! Someone suffering from depression can learn the wisdom that can change their lives completely. Another who scorned the idea of the Creator can now find an explanation that fits and satisfy their soul.

	It‚Äôs all in our hands. It's up to us to decide to be channels for the Creator to reach his beloved ones. By our deciding to post, share, and reach out to those in our circle, we are providing the light to those around us and using the internet for it‚Äôs the true purpose.

	The world will indeed be healed and prepare itself for the Final Redemption through the tools and outlets that surround our lives.",1576510133.0

spirituality,Ruler,"I need your help. I was chosen to be Ruler of New Avalon about 4 years ago. I understood you have to make it through time. I was never told nor did I ask why I was chosen. All I was told was ‚Äúit was my destiny‚Äù. Because my ‚Äúrace was meant for destruction‚Äù. 

So I took the people as my own and have been working to save the world and them ever since. It took me so long because I was afraid of prophecy etc. And I also said the man who offered the inheritance was a devil. Which was wrong of me. 


I was given rulership power and authority over new Avalon as well as 10000 years to live or possibly ‚Äúreign‚Äù. 

I have been working on revolution ever since. Trying to secure our fates and destiny. Because as we have it now. We are headed down the road to nowhere. And I want to go anywhere.. with my people. 

I know rulership isn‚Äôt beautiful but this is necessary to get past these times. We are in danger and I want to be used and guided in how to make things better. Anyone wanna help just shoot a message. 

I have kept this secret for going on 4 years now and I am finally beginning to open up. I am sorry for what has been done. But i believe that it is not my fault because I was chosen. And I didn‚Äôt want it. It was destiny... not choice. 

I‚Äôm afraid the world is too big for a one man army. I want to join others. And empower them with the story. I want to be a unit. Anywhere a strong one. 

The last thing the man told me was ‚ÄúI am now a guide and you want your excuse to be you didn‚Äôt know‚Äù. 

I was cursed with strong negative thoughts and thoughts of hell and condemnation. The truth is I just want to be an asset. I just want to help the people I chose to. 

I was given 10k years, New Avalon. And a resurrected brother.

spirituality,The world is coming to an end.,"This world as we know it is coming to an end. I can feel it deep in my soul. It sings to the very core of my Being. It tells me that soon this beautiful dream will come to an end. The birds and the trees and the profound intricacies of life are singing their final songs. Making way for something new.

I don‚Äôt know what Earth‚Äôs ending will look like. Perhaps it will end in the blink of an eye. Or perhaps it will end not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with something in between. Perhaps it‚Äôs ending will be dark, or perhaps it‚Äôs ending will be full of light.

There are many different kinds of endings. Some endings come at the close of a theater scene, where the cast takes a final bow before exiting the stage. Other endings signify not the final stage of something, but the beginning stage of something else.

Perhaps Earth‚Äôs ending will be physical. Perhaps there will be a bomb, or a plague, or a meteor strike from the heavens above.

But I don‚Äôt believe that Earth‚Äôs ending will be physical. I believe it will be spiritual. I believe  Earth‚Äôs ending will not signify the final stage of our time here, but the beginning stage of something else. Something more beautiful. Something more loving. A place where everyone from the insects to the animals to each other are treated equally with compassion. Perhaps the Earth we have all dreamed of really is possible.

But all I know is that the world as we know it is coming to an end. And I am grateful to have shared the experience with all of you. Whatever our next chapter has in store for us, I will see each of you there.

spirituality,God is a pedophile and Reality is a thought experiment.,"I'm aware my perspective will be unpopular and triggers a strong emotional response in people who will not accept what I have, and that's fine. Spirituality is an individual thing, and we all come to different conclusions as to who God is to us.

I have to say this everytime, buy no, not your judeochristian ""God"". God in the most general sense, the god that *is*. God is everything anyone is, as well as everything anyone is not. Everyone is anything god is and can be. If anyone could be a pedophile, so is God. Of course, human subjective morals don't apply to God, it doesn't matter one bit on any level other than human, but I like to point this out because it is the only logical conclusion when discussing the type of God I believe in. If God were not a pedophile, there would be no pedophiles, as anything that is must be God. There is no thing thqt God is not or is a creation of God. My God is non-judgmental of his creation on a moral level, though God may have created a version of itself to be a judge of human ideas and actions... Just as humans are a limited version of God, God may have created a version of itself to preside over humanity to judge them, this possibly being the ""Super-Ego"" within us individually. God is good just as God is evil. Non-duality of duality. Yin &amp; Yang. Light &amp; Dark. God is not either or, but both and neither at once.

The thought experiment this reality is exists to discover what *can be*. Every iota of progress forward or backward in time is a new discovery for God. From all perspectives down to sub-atomic, God is experiencing and discovering something new every moment. Beyond spacetime there are discoveries being made which impact us on our linear timeframe as well. It's a game God is playing with itself. And God said, ""Alright, let's see..."" and that's how it all began.

spirituality,"Live by faith in God, not money! :)"," Jesus said ''I have come that you might have life, and that you might have it more abundantly'' (**John 10:10**¬† )

Most church goers take this to mean that the [abundant life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeR7YrqxiuQ) is wealth and money, and lots of it! The prosperity gospel is popular, even though it flies in the face of everything Jesus taught about not working for money (**Matthew 6:24** ), about forsaking all our wealth (**Luke 14:33** ), about it being the POOR (**Luke 6:20** , **Matthew 5:3** ) who will receive the Kingdom of God, and about how, unless we choose to deny ourselves and take up our cross and follow him (**Mark 8:34** ), building our house on the rock of his teaching. (**Matthew 7:26-27** )

Granted, when we do forsake all and start living by faith, oftentimes God gives us 'wealth', but what marks the difference is that it is coming as a gift FROM God, to be used FOR God according to HIS will, and not wealth we have created by prostituting our lives to whoever wants to pony up the cash.

But, the purpose of me writing this was not to focus on wealth as it is defined by possessions and money, but as it is defined by the lack of these things. Though circumstances, material things, and good food can bring satisfaction to our lives and contribute to our abundance, they all pass, whereas I think true wealth (true abundance) must be something more lasting.

Jesus says he has come to give us an abundant life, so when does that start? What do you think you need in order to have an abundant life? Surely the abundant life Jesus is talking about is something right here and now, and NOT dependent on money or possessions coming to us in the future. Jesus wants us to have an abundant life, and like a lot of what he taught, there is a paradox. It is in forsaking everything we own and in choosing to stop working for money, that it comes (for life is what we are throwing away while we chase the things we need and want).

Most people will argue, ''But then you'll be poor...what will you have then...what will you be able to do''. Well, quite a lot actually! When we let go of the desire to control our lives and start to live by faith, then God really does give us an abundant life.

That abundant life may come in terms of more travelling, in speaking to thousands of people a week, in learning new skills, contributing to projects, inspiring people with music or art, helping under-privileged people to read, seeing different places each day, being out doors breathing the air instead of being couped up in an office all day, or kicking back with some fellow brothers and sisters and having a relaxing drink whilst playing cards!

But, the abundant life is most noticeably found (IMO), in simply trying to show love to others and to God. Realizing that his love (intangible as it is) and our reflection of it, is ALL that we really need. When we know this, is there any time that your life is not abundant, full of his life, love and grace?

spirituality,True spirituality has more in common with conservatism than liberalism,"Hi folks,
As you go inside...as you begin to appreciate What Is. You stop the churning up of manifold desires. You see that what is already there contains such virtue that it melts your heart.

I always thought of ""spiritual"" people as very liberal, very left. As a ""brand identity,"" this must be the case.

But leftism, despite infinite emotional care for the unjustly treated, seems more about tearing away the old and installing the new.

Conservatism, meaning ""to conserve,"" is far more spiritual. It grants that what is there has value. This value is deeply felt in meditation. And it was only found in slow, patient effort. You would not be quick to destroy.

Now...this is boring. This idea appears rather dim to the intellect, which likes to create bold new structures. We want to be of the ""avant garde."" But love, warmth and peace are already there in abundance. There in the established. In the no longer exciting.

When you understand this, your spirit rushes to defend What Is. Because it is more good than bad. And when there is good mixed with bad, bad can be transformed in the water of its relationship with the good.

When stores of good are not yet in place, little can be done. But the intellect is happy in this zone. Egoistic satisfaction multiplies, and becomes impressed with it's own glamour.

spirituality,Most Common Religious Misconception,"Hate to break it to you, but Jesus wont come to save you...but the good news is, He did show you how to save yourselves...thinking that Jesus will come down one day and save you is just lazy thinking and lame excuse not to work on your own self.

The fact is: All souls live on forever, there is nothing to be saved from, except from your own fears, hate, ignorance, illusions and ego...which always leads to death.

You can follow standard christian route: follow the commandments, be obedient, be good, wait on Jesus, grow old... die and be reborn..

Or, you can walk the Christ's talk: master yourself, be great, be glorious, ascend and achieve salvation of your own accord through your own self-mastery.

Nobody will raise you to heaven for you, nor will he trow you to hell. All you are doing you are doing to yourself. Don't let any religious people spill some bs that you are sinner, or that you need someone in order to save yourself. You have all it takes, you are enough, you are holy child of God, and God who is your greatest helper is always with and within you.

Upon death, all souls return to heaven from whence they came, but this is not what Jesus meant by Eternal Life, yes Eternal Life is the Truth, and we all go on forever, but ASCENSION is the ATTAINMENT of Eternal Life, while still in body, rather than dying.

The promised land and eternal life which all the holy scriptures talk about is Ascension, it is to overcome death, it is to raise your consciousness to high heavenly frequency and become one with God while here in flesh.

Once you ascended, there is no more death. no more birth, you are your Higher Ascended, Christ-Like, God-Like, perfect Self, a Holy Son of God. And power, life, light, love, wisdom and generosity, compassion, kindness and understanding of Supreme Spirit, becomes your own.

This is what Jesus had known, this is why He was Son of God, he lived up to the Truth of His being, he reached that higher frequency of Higher Self, He was God in flesh, and so are you, you just don't know it...yet.

So, will you give all of yourself to find the Truth, to know who you are, or will you waste your days waiting on death?

For that is what you are doing if you are not seeking the Truth, the Way, the Life, and the Light of your own Being.

‚ÄúMany are called but few are chosen‚Äù means that everyone is called but only few care to listen, and only a handful choose to answer the call of God.

Question is, what will you do?

It up to you, and no one else..

If you don't know what to do, then for the start:  
raise volume/vibe/frequency  
through Love to the ------------------------\[\] max.

spirituality,Being natural is the path to healing.,"Hey guys, 

A follow-up to another video I made recently.  Same topic, but this time short and sweet:

Many times we put on a fake happy face, and try to squeeze some sort of happiness out of life instead of just being honest about and accepting the fact that we're not truly happy.  If we can just be natural, which includes being authentically discontent sometimes, then this is the path towards true healing.  It also allows us to be authentic in our joy, love, and peace.

The teacher didn't get around to answering, but I did, and my answer was.  ""Well, I don't know.  But I'm pretty sure Gordan Ramsay enjoying his cooking is a lot more spiritual than constantly trying to figure out if everything we do is rooted in ego.""

Not everything has to be ""enlightened"".  It's OK to do things that make you feel good.  If at the end of the day they bite you, well, you learn!  But you don't have to force yourself to do things that go against your nature.  You don't have to drag yourself through the mud.  I mean, life is hard enough as it is.  I don't know about you, but I turned to spirituality in order to make life better.  I don't care about the folks who say ""there is no distinction between good and bad"".  OK, a useful tool for acceptance, sure.  But let's be honest.  Are we just doing this for the lulz?  Or are we doing this because we suffer, and want relief from our suffering?  So why create even more for ourselves?

That doesn't mean we don't have to face uncomfortable truths about ourselves along the way.  Or do things that scare us to death.  We most certainly do have to do those things.  But I feel like somewhere along the line that turned into self-flagellation.  Like it wasn't OK just to have a good day sometimes, even if you can't really put your finger on why.

So that's why I say: just live the life you want to live.  There is no right answer to life.  There is no one-size-fits-all.  We can learn from each other, for sure.  But I don't know about you guys, but I'm kind of tired of dragging myself through the mud.  I've learned a lot on this spiritual path, and I reckon I still have plenty to learn.  But right now what I'm learning is acceptance: deep acceptance and love for myself.  And you know.  The ability to say yes to what I want, and no to what I don't.  

And remember, humility.  Live and let live.

Have a wonderful day!",1590228679.0
spirituality,"Spiritual bypassing and a request that in the rules of r/spirituality, spiritual bypassing be explicitly banned","So I don't believe that all people here are aware of a phenomenon called spiritual bypassing that allows people to use their spirituality to justify any behavior, but especially to justify the oppression and abuse of others. I notice it is a huge problem in this subreddit and we need a rule against it or this subreddit is going to continue to enable the oppression and abuse of marginalized people. 

Essentially I run into this time and time again with my students and the general public, especially on reddit and definitely in r/spirituality. People who think that their religion or spirituality can explain away prejudice as acceptable, abuse as necessary, etc. Spewing things like, 'you cannot love yourself until you hate yourself' or 'if it was really a problem God wouldn't let it happen'. This is extremely harmful and toxic to people and society. Using spirituality to harm others is not new, it is something many religions have done for many years whether intentionally or not. It should not be tolerated here or in any spiritual community because when it is, abuse occurs and goes unchecked. I have seen it, time and time again. 

Why is spiritual bypassing not worthy of a suspension or ban from r/spirituality?

I argue it is and should be added to the rules. I argue telling someone child abuse, abuse, rape and or murder is okay, is never okay and should have repercussions from the r/spirituality team. I don't think we should tolerate child abuse or abuse of others as being okay for any reason, regardless of your spirituality. Excusing these sorts of behaviors enables them and leads to the oppression of the most vulnerable. 

It makes an abuser's job even easier and since abuse is perpetrated against the most vulnerable, excusing these behaviors with spirituality and or religion, contributes to the oppression and marginalization of others. 

I ask that we take a serious look at how we affect others and we make a rule against spiritual bypassing in r/spirituality. 

For further information on spiritual bypassing I suggest the articles [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/emotional-sobriety/201110/beware-spiritual-bypass), [here](http://www.uumidland.org/blog/2018/08/15/spiritual-bypassing/) and [here](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-spiritual-bypassing/).

No matter your religion, belief system or spirituality, spiritual bypassing can be used to oppress others or even yourself. Please don't let the inability to take self responsibility, oppress marginalized people any longer. If you know someone who uses spiritual bypassing, be aware that they can excuse any behavior, any at all with spiritual bypassing and decide if you are willing to accept that risk into your life. I for one, do not tolerate it in my life under any circumstances. I was abused as a child for 5 years and my abuser excused his behavior with his religion. Don't be that person. That person doesn't go down in the history books as the good guy, no matter what way you slice it. That person lost his family, his home, his job and his life because even if you don't want to accept self responsibility, abuse is not okay, in fact, it's typically illegal.

Please r/spirituality, stop allowing spiritual bypassing to occur here without repercussions. It's important that we don't let others cause unnecessary harm without accepting responsibility for their choices. People learn the hard way, if they are allowed to get away with abuse, they'll keep doing it. I really hope we can work together to reduce harm. No one deserves to be abused, let's stop enabling abusers in r/spirituality. Let's not tolerate spiritual bypassing as an excuse for abuse, assault and murder. We can do better than that, I know we can. 

Survivors should feel safe speaking about spirituality here, as it stands, it is not safe for us. It's important we reject spiritual bypassing in r/spirituality, for all our sakes. I hope that we can do better moving forward. We can only overcome spiritual bypassing if we come together and make a change. Let's make that change.",1589628683.0

spirituality,Had a discussion about what is love and I said it could simply be a collection of neuro chemical reactions in our brain. Eg mdma makes users experience feelings of love. It upset a number of people who were insulted that their experiences of love could be deconstructed to mere chemical reactions.,"I wondered what people in this community felt about that. 

Whether the human construct and love is simply an evolution of our biochemical makeup. Or if it is more. If there is a notion of spirituality rather than just neuro chemical make up. 

Also is there is such a thing as law of attraction and the universe, and is that really indicative of there being a god or simply chemical reactions and exchanges of energy on a much grander scale, in that it stands to reason that thinking certain thoughts will attract that to you because the universe is made up of energy, not even on a mystical level, but a purely logical and physical level. Neutrons protons and electrons and magnetic fields of energy are the make up of this planetary organism we are part of and came from. So it stands to reason that there would be some degree of interconnectedness through this exchange of energy otherwise known as the law of attraction. 

Further to this, the same day I had that discussion about whether love is chemical and biological or intuitive and feeling on a more spiritual level, I then decided to chill and watch a movie on Netflix and ‚Äòrandomly‚Äô picked a keanu reeves flick called replica, and I was so so surprised when his main character who is a professor trying to study the cloning of human beings and consciousness for the never ending extension of life, has a discussion with his wife about yes you guessed it ‚Äòwhat is love‚Äô and he argued the same point as mine almost verbatim. 
I was so shocked as it‚Äôs not exactly a common topic to be discussing that could have come about by mere coincidence and so soon after too. 

Ive always has insanely crazy experiences of ‚Äòcoincidences‚Äô in such unbelievable ways. What does it mean. This is no doubt synchronicity. But is synchronicity just an exchange of energy on a molecular level positive and negative energy etc as discussed, or is it something more divine and spiritual. And if it is how could you possibly know. Those who claim they experienced divine confirmation first hand have usually taken psychedelics. And that goes back to my very first point at the start about our human condition and experience possibly being simply created by our chemical makeup and nothing to do with divinity.

spirituality,Peeling oranges for luck,"So im sitting here currently on my bed eating oranges and I got to thinking that, for me personally, eating mandarin oranges is luckier to eat than navel oranges. 

I was at work eating oranges on a previous day and I like to peel my oranges in a specific way. I try to peel them so the peel is all still in one piece. Never was a reason for doing besides I just strongly felt to peel them like that, strong enough where I wont do it any other way. No one ever showed me or taught me to peel them like this. At work, someone noticed me peeling them this way and approached me. They spoke about how their grandma would always peel them like that and she considered it good luck. Now, if I had not; picked an orange to eat for work that day, while also working at the place I do, at the time I was at, at the same moment the other person was working, and whatever he had to work through to approach me then I would have never known (perhaps) that doing this was a form of increasing ones luck.

I have an idea of starting a YouTube channel more focused on metaphysical/spiritual truths presented in a pragmatic form.

I kinda doubt  I should start one, since this field is over saturated.

spirituality,"I believe we are Gods, but trapped and fed on","I believe we are Gods. Its been proven by many declassified CIA documents that almost all humans are capable of remote viewing, astral projection, ESP, and even things like telekinesis and reality manipulation. And the Archons have trapped us here to consume our energy like the Machines in the Matrix.  We lose our abilities when we sin and fall into darkness, hence why the ruling elite pushes such things at us like porn, alcohol and drugs, start wars, and so on.  The extra chemicals added to our food and water such as fluoride also effect this.

This is what Jesus was actually trying to tell us.  Its the reason that the Romans and the Jews had to fight off a revolution of the masses that lasted nearly 300 years that was started by Jesus.  This was the primary reason why they wrote the Bible in 325 AD that basically taught the masses how to be better slaves.  That also didn't contain any of Jesus's actual gospels.

I would recommend this gospel that was used by Jesus and his disciples

[**On the Origin of the World**](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/origin-Barnstone.html) **&lt;-Read This!**

It goes into depth about how Earth was created, and how humans ended up here.  And the real version of the Adam and Eve story that Jesus shared.  How the Archons enslaved humanity.  Why there are different races of man.

I highly recommend checking out some of the ancient texts from the Nag Hammadi.  They are almost all gospels and texts from Jesus and his Apostles that got left out of the Bible.  The Sophia of Jesus, which came directly from Jesus is quite mind blowing, he tells about how creation started, how the heavens were created, and even the meaning of life.

[http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhlalpha.html](http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhlalpha.html)

One of the strangest parts of the Bible that was written in 325AD is it almost completely leaves out the Archons, who Jesus claimed was the source of evil in our world and what actually caused the masses to stand up against them and the ruling elite who worshipped these Archons.

The Archons are lead by the Demiurge. In Jesus's and other gnostic teachings he is known as Yaldabaoth, Samael, Saklas, the Blind God, the Lion faced God, and the Beast.  Father of all the Archons(dark gods) and demons and creator of Earth and our solar system.  He was described as having the head of a Lion.

There's a lot of belief that he was the actual God in the Old Testament, and not the same God as the one Jesus came to tell us about.  Hence why the Old Testament God was so drastically different and dark.  The Lion of Judah is the 2nd biggest Jewish symbol after the Star of David.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Yaldabaoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge#Yaldabaoth)

Just look at ancient Egypt, they had three distinct ages, the first was a golden age, then came a dark age, where the worshipped gods were changed to the Ogdoad that resembled the known Archons, before the age of Osiris that brought back a new golden age to Egypt.

The Rich Elite of our world actually worship these Archons and Dark Gods such as Ba'al and Moloch(Bohemian Grove).

spirituality,13 Zodiac star signs explained for beginners (including the new one),"**Thought this would help people who don't know what star signs are.** 

What are star signs? 

Star signs are the 12 30 degree sections making up the full 360 degree rotation of the earth. If you imagine a line going from the earth to the sun and beyond, that line draws the zodiac as a large circle as the earth rotates around the sun.

This large circle is called the 'ecliptic' which is essentially just a flat disk extending outwards in line with the earth and the sun. 

This is different to the 'celestial equator' which is basically just the earths equator extended outwards The FOUR elements of star signs The 12 (well, 13 now) star signs can be sorted into FOUR basic elements. 

These elements have certain characteristics which describe the star signs within them. 

Fire 

Air 

Water 

Earth 

Here's what each sign GROUPING means. 

WATER SIGNS: Water signs are usually fairly emotional and sensitive. They're very clever, and tend to notice things very easily that most people might miss or ignore. They like keeping to themselves and tend to be introverts. They show lots of support and love to their close members of their inner circle, like friends and family. Water Signs are: Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. 

FIRE SIGNS: Fire signs are almost always very passionate and vivid. They can tend to get angry easily and easily emotional. That being said, they do also forgive people who have wronged them quickly. they act in the moment, with passion and emotion. They're highly intelligent and strong. Fire Signs are: Aries, Leo and Sagittarius.

EARTH SIGNS: Earth signs usually tend to be grounded and calm. They're realists and like being practical and sensible. That being said, they can also be emotional, just like the fire signs. Because they're SO grounded in the physical reality, the tend to be more likely to obsess over money or physical items. Earth Signs are: Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. 

AIR SIGNS: Air signs are social creatures. They like thinking, talking and interacting. They're airy and free, and don't like being tied down to things like jobs or even places for too long. Because of their light and free thinking, they enjoy deep philosophical discussions and ideas. Air Signs are: Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. Important note about star signs Make sure you understand that you can ALWAYS have exceptions. 

These groupings and their descriptions are not always accurate. You can have an emotional Air sign or a grounded fire sign. It doesn't really have to align always with these descriptions. 

That might help you understand why they may not match up perfectly for you or someone you know. What are the 13 star signs 

The 12 signs in order are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces There are 13 signs in total, because we've only just discovered a NEW star sign making it 13 total. 

This new star sign is called Ophiuchus.

spirituality,Physical existence is pain,"The universe, karma, and reincarnation is the enemy. They trap us in this reality full of suffering. It's a trap. With each life we collect more garbage to resolve in the next life. I have to escape this madness of reincarnation.

The human body is like a prison. It craves food, water, sleep, sex, etc. The body is an animal. It hinders spiritual development, growth, and self realization.

This world pulls people down. It's an evil place. It drags down spiritual development, it changes, brainwashes souls. This world manipulates good people to do bad things.

This world is based on the suffering of beings. Physical life is based on suffering. Physical beings grow by eating. Eating is evil. Carnivores take away the life of other animals, herbivores take away the life of plants. But in the end this dark world forces beings to hurt other beings in order to survive. It's a tragedy. It's sad.

I became vegetarian years ago, because I knew eating animals is wrong. Now I arrived at the state where I feel eating anything is wrong. Plants and vegetables live too, they are life which has to be respected and preserved.

I realized I have to die. I have to get out of my body. I suffer in it. And even worse as long as I'm alive I'm contributing to this suffering of the world. It feels like I'm trapped here against my own will. I need peace, freedom, and a place where beings are self sustaining, and they're kind and helpful to each other and there's positivity.

I just hate being here. I hate being human. I'm not who I want to be. I'm what the universe wants me to be, and what karma wants me to be. Both of which are wrong...

I want to be free. I want to explore a world of wonders, live in a world of peace, be a being of light and love, and to form myself the way I want to be and not be shaped by life and outer circumstances.
I want to be free from eating food, drinking water, needing sleep, sexuality, aging, and every primitive bodily function.

I don't hate my body, but I need to die and become something more. I just feel like I have to go. This world is not for me, and if free will exists then I'm asking the universe to take away my body so I can continue my own journey and become free from this reality...",1574881289.0

She had beautiful pale skin and so soft and gentle. She had pure white hair and light blue eyes. She was wearing a pink and white dress that looked like it was from the 1800's. I felt a huge surge of emotion come from my body when I met her. I cried a bit and then we danced. She said she was God and I was apart of her. I asked her why I've suffered so much and she said to endure, to become a higher being. It's hard to remember exactly what happend it was just so beautiful. She said she loved me and the only thing holding me back was my constant being on guard, she is always with me and she is God. I couldn't look at her face completely, it was like I was being blinded by the sun. Like my vision just couldn't reach the perfection.

spirituality,The True Spiritual Path.,"I may upset some people with this, but I feel it needs to be said. Of course, everyone is within their right to believe what they want. But if what you're interested in is Truth, and with Truth, freedom from suffering and growing degrees of peace and love. then this is the only path I know of which works.

Of course, you can fool yourself, and that's your right.  And I've believed in plenty of falsehoods along the way... they can be comforting and even serve a sort of purpose.  But for me I have always gone deeper into Truth, no matter how uncomfortable... because Truth is where peace lies.  You know, in reality.  When I'm in touch with reality, I'm good.  When I'm not, on some level, I will continue to suffer.

So I know we're in the /r/spirituality sub, and everyone has a right to share their stuff.  I don't make it my mission to go around telling people off.  But like I said, I do think this needs to be said. So:

The true spiritual path is not about spirit guides, or celestial beings, or fairies, or twin flames, or any of that.  The true spiritual path is about learning to live life on life term's... it's about total acceptance of reality for what it is, no matter how ugly or uncomfortable it may be at times.  This is the true spiritual path.

Some people say ""well you're just an atheist, then"".  Well, sort of.  But spiritual teachers are considered as such because they talk about matters of the heart.  What is certain is that, through the mind, you will never be able to reach. 

But through the heart, through love, through celebration and a deep receptiveness... surely you will come to know the Truth as it really is.  

Then you can love, then you can rejoice, then you can put down your battles and just be.  

And in its ordinariness I don't think it's *less* spiritual.  I think it's *more* spiritual.

I wish no harm with this post and I hope you all can get something out of it.  Be well.",1595027789.0

spirituality,"""quitting marijuana has opened up the world for me. i am proud of myself.""","Do your best to not be too harsh towards yourself when you do eventually take a toke.

Right now you are experiencing a pride-high about being clean &amp; sober. That will wear off and the desire to get high again will return, and you will do it. But we really don't have control over our urges because they have all been scripted. There is the urge to get high, and there is the urge to abstain. The strongest urge wins. Sometimes it's the urge to use, other times it's the urge to abstain. Neither urge is bad. Both are necessary for our life-story which has built-in changes and includes illness, injuries, diseases, bad moods &amp; misfortunes off and on from the womb to the grave regardless of what we learn or practice or realize or believe or experience or know.

In other words, you're gonna experience shit &amp; ice cream no matter how cautious or reckless, sane or insane, healthy or unhealthy you are. 

That pride you feel for being clean &amp; sober? Yea, that's the same kind of pride you should have when you're not. 

Honor thy inner stoner.  By all means quit when the urge to quit is stronger than the urge to use, but when the urge to use is stronger than the urge to quit, celebrate &amp; party and bust out the heavy metal and P-Funk. 

Ain't no titties or smoke or cheeseburgers or pizza or music after death. This here dreamworld is where all the color and action is. After death is just relentless bliss, a never-changing Home Reality of relentlessly never-changing sanity &amp; sobriety. We get bored with that never-changing Reality once in awhile and therefore script dreamlives with our fellow perfect spirits and then live them out in the flesh like we are doing at the moment.

To be honest, i didn't really believe in magick and demons and all of that, but i changed my opinion. So i made this post just to advice young people, like me who are interested in spiritual topics, and all hidden knowledge and occult teaching. Be aware of what you read, it's all fun and games, until you get possesed by a low vibrational entity and go insane. Especially those who read those topics, with egotistical motivation.

Do not question the legitimacy of Christ or else you do not have faith, to me that sounds like suppressing our natural instinct to question everything which is what we've been doing for thousands of years if not much much longer, a lot of things I read feel like it's just trying to escape our instincts, which is what people seem to be trying to do all the time, is deny the fact that a lot of our decisions in life revolves around our Instincts and biology, to deny that we are animals and equal to animals, because we have the ability to make our own choices, we are basically a being who thinks they have full control over their choices but biology plays a big role in our lives and we aren't even aware of it, almost anything we like to do can be looked at and diagnosed a reason, because so many people enjoy our own enjoyments that makes it a universal thing, hense you are not unique and will never be, because it's written in us to be a certain way wether we like it or not, we may have the freedom of choice and the ability to make critical thought, but it doesn't mean we aren't ruled by our instincts, religion is a product of our Instinct to want to feel a reason to be alive and feel purpose which religion and the idea of an afterlife gives us, without religion many many more people would be killing themselves, religious people try to see life as if there was no afterlife, no god, nothing and everything you've been following up til now does not exist, how does that make you feel? I wouldn't be surprised if that idea makes you feel Alone, sad, or even depressed, it's our way of life, us as a species needs something to make them feel useful, something bigger to believe in, otherwise it'd feel hopeless and miserable, so even religion is made from instincts. People are just like animals that seem to look a lot more complicated.

spirituality,HEAVEN IS A PRISON! How to break free from the matrix and the reincarnation cycle (very important ! Can save your soul),"
Paradise is a trap! The cycle of reincarnation is caused by extraterrestrial cosmic technology
Hi everyone, I joined this forum after my worldview was broadened due to some events in 2016. I watched a lot of youtube videos to reconcile my revelation with reality, and I came across this man named Simon Parkes. He seems to me to be a very intelligent and compassionate man who I completely believe in because some of the things he mentioned correspond to my experiences.

Simon Parkes has memories from before birth. He says we choose to incarnate as humans. After that I went looking for pre-birth memories and there are a lot of similarities between people's stories. Basically, as pure bodily spirits, the soul longs to experience contrast: sadness and joy, suffering and well-being. They like everything. You can find more information about this on youtube. People with pre-birth memories also say that we choose our parents.

But there is another thing Simon said: Earth is a prison planet. No one seems quite sure how we got here, but Simon is very sure that:

The light at the end of the tunnel that you see when you die is a TRICK. It is an alien cosmic technology created by a species known as the Archons (i.e. ‚Äúarchan‚Äù gels).

What happens when you die is that you have the free will to choose where to go. You can return to the void of nothingness and emptiness which is what TRUE paradise is, or maybe you can wake up in another reality / dimension as if you had a long dream.

But what you NEVER NEVER need to do is surrender to the light you see when you die. Resist. The light is actually a kind of soul harvest matrix that will fry your soul like a fly in a bugzapper and steal your memories (the process is to review all of your life experiences in a matter of moments)

But here's the kicker: Due to the Perfect Law of Karma, your soul cannot be forced into the light. He has the free will to choose to resist. To combat this, the Archons will create fake holographs of your deceased parents to tell you to join them. It's a lie!!! You must refuse to join them. Call on the name of Yeshua if you cannot get away from them.

If you go into the light, the life force that your soul gathers will be consumed, its memories will be removed, and the Archons will tell them that they have done something wrong / wrong and that they need to reincarnate and do it right. . Do not reincarnate, because you will simply return to the prison planet and your soul will again be tortured for another life!

Hollywood is VERY aware of this deception and instead of helping us, they are helping them. This is why you see ""Go into the Light"" all over the television. His indoctrination! They want you to be reborn over and over again so that your life force energy can be consumed before your soul is sent back to earth and recycled into a new container.

Choose to go into the void, where you can rest in peace for 10,000 years, and then have the Soul Generator incarnate you in another life form on another planet when you feel ready to live again.

spirituality,Where do we go when we die? Why do some souls wander?," Where do we go when we die? Don't you see with your own eyes that the body is cremated or the body is buried? Do you have any doubts about what happens to the body that goes underground, under the soil? Would you like to dig and check? You know for sure that regardless of whether we are cremated or buried, the body returns to dust. Then why this question? This question is because of ignorance. Because we are ignorant, we believe that we are the mind and the ego. And this causes rebirth because of Karma, our actions. However, if we realize that we are the Divine Soul, we are liberated and we are united with God. Souls don't wander. This is a figment of our imagination. It is a fairy tale that believes in ghosts and wandering Souls. As long as we believe in this ignorance, we will never realize this truth.",1603364255.0
spirituality,"""Things just happen"" is BS.","This idea that ""things just happen"" is not true. It's true only if you're looking at it from the standpoint of the ego.  Once you begin chipping away at the ego, which is obsessed with control, it *appears* that things just happen automatically.  But that's not actually true. You still have to make decisions.  If things truly just happen, you would never leave your bed.  

Philosophically speaking, sure, it makes sense.  You're hungry, so that obligates you to leave your bed.  Things just happen.  OK, I understand that.  But you still have to make yourself get out of bed. 

It's just that the ""you"" you identified with in the past is not the real you.  But there's still things you have to do, decisions to be made, etc. 

You can live a better life.  Oftentimes that means surrendering control and relaxing into the flow.  But even that is a decision on deep subconscious level.  

You can pursue the things you want to pursue.  You can try new things.  You can take risks. You can learn.  You can speak your mind.  You can go climb a mountain. You have so many options. 

I don't find it insightful of empowering to pretend like we have no agency whatsoever.  No, that's not true.  Throw out the philosophy.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.

The fact is that this life is what you choose to make of it.  I understand that it can be overwhelming.  And I understand that ""things just happen"" is a way of learning to surrender control.  And that ""there is no good or bad"" is also a way of accepting all the ups and downs of life. 

But these things are just *tools*.  Medicine.  Once you're well, go a little deeper!  You can just be a normal human being.  You can do the things you want to do.  You can make decisions. Expressing that is not an attack on your life philosophy.  It's just the way things are.  You're just a human being.

Next is the throat chakra, there are many techniques to activate the throat chakras. I'l teach you a beginner one. Breathe in twice through you nose and out twice thru you mouth in a fast repeating pattern, do not stop, unless you really can handle it, but this is when its getting serious so be prepared. you ears with seal up. good. it make feel like cold air but just think about being astronaut breathing that space suit air floating in a white void. next is the third eye chakra, is our pineal gland, cross you eyes and look up toward the center of your eyebrows. use the ceiling corner as a focus point if you need to. you will feel you pineal gland vibrating and the calcium shield blocking your pineal gland breaking. your eyes will rapidly blink, that when you know your 3rd eye is charged, focus your vision upward out the top of you head thru the 3rd eye. your head may feel like its splitting but think like a flower and bloom in the top of your being. Great now that you can activate your chakras. that just the beginning, now take lsd or mushrooms, or both, mix in some weed if you can handle. do it over and over. practice while your sober, do it when you trip. trust me, it works. once you master the technique then it is you own. its my technique right now because im teaching it to you. you'll be the teacher one day. you should get some selenite and get some acid and do that technique and keep a fire going, see what happens. activate you chakras all the time.  find teachers like ME.

spirituality,Miracles happen,"9 years ago I had an abortion. The whole experience felt wrong at the time, like there was absolute spiritual ramifications of that decision. I felt it. But I was young, and not in touch with that little voice inside us all. Since that day I was not able to get pregnant again. I had accepted that I was not worthy to be a mother because of what I‚Äôd done. It took years, but I finally made peace with that.

Then a few years ago I ODed. Had stopped breathing &amp; just slipped away. A friend desperately tried to wake me up, I wouldn‚Äôt come to until he asked ‚Äúthe guy upstairs‚Äù for help. Then I came back. I still couldn‚Äôt breathe, I remember thinking ‚Äúhow am I conscious when I can‚Äôt breathe? Where was I just now? How am I alive?‚Äù So many unanswered questions but I immediately, innately knew something big had saved me for a reason bigger than myself.

I‚Äôd been on a spiritual path for some time, but that experience kicked it into high gear. I was always spiritually sensitive, but that connection was loud now. Premonitions, both waking &amp; in dreams, intuition, the ability to see &amp; hear from the other side.

These ‚Äúgifts‚Äù have been ramping up since then, this year being the most intense. Meanwhile years of hard shadow work &amp; self-care finally led me to my truth. I forgive and am forgiven. I am here to love the unlovable, and heal the unhealed. Something is shifting in the world and I am here to help facilitate. My heart is open. Kindness is my language. Love is my air. I am one with all. I am one with you! We are one.

I know this to be true with every fiber of my being. There is so much beauty &amp; change coming, I feel it. I‚Äôve focused my energies this year on amplifying that love for all of mankind, and meditated with intentions of abundance.

2 months ago my path crossed with someone special. While I was not consciously ready for a relationship (I have work to do), my intuition was screaming. So many synchronicities I knew I couldn‚Äôt ignore it. Like I‚Äôd known this man, yet I don‚Äôt at all.

I knew before it was confirmed, but I am now 8 weeks pregnant. For the first time in my life I feel like I am right where I need to be, this version of me, and right on time. Like every bad thing that happened had to happen to make me this person right here right now, truly worthy of these blessings.

I am worthy. You are worthy. We are worthy. Never give up! Open your heart, and it will be filled in ways you can‚Äôt even imagine ‚ù§Ô∏è

spirituality,Message from TREES to people,"Recently, I received a very important message from trees to people.  The trees really wanted to share this with you.

""Call

You are conscious because you were born by a conscious

You are nature because you were born by a nature

You are the earth because you were born from the Earth

Everything is conscious because everything is a consciousness

Everything is connected because everything is one

Everything has a spirit in it, feel its call
And go back where you come from

We see your thoughts, we hear your words

Come to us, we call you, our Comrade of ‚ÄòExperience‚Äô

We need each other more than ever 

If reading our words you feel a longing for a forest, you feel the need to meet nature 
Do not hesitate, follow the voice of your heart

We are waiting to remind you of your connection with the Source

We are waiting to heal you

We are waiting to lead you out of the illusion of separation

Open yourself to our coexistence
And this will open the way to the end what you call suffering. ""

spirituality,The answer we are all searching for.,"Purpose. What is our purpose? We are born, given an identity, name, religion, nationality, a belief system that we are told to rely upon throughout our lives.  A belief system which in some ways is very analogous to other religious belief systems and in some way contradicting. As we set on this course we defend this identity ferociously without once questioning our existence because this is what we have been told to do, since we were an infant to adulthood. Without once scrutinizing and question what we‚Äôve been told or taught. We never like to introspect, and if some brave souls do muster up the courage to do so and ask relevant questions as to why are we following something so archaic in nature, whether be it the caste system, sexual orientation, vocation in life, or some of the religious scripts which implicitly imply that there is only one savior for the world and the way to that messiah is by following that particular religion.  In all the sacred texts it is said that man has been created in the image of God himself. That god is a term that we‚Äôve given but it could mean anything higher power, consciousness, creator, divine spirit, or angels that maybe my point is that if we are a mirroring reflection of the supreme power then aren‚Äôt we the creators of our lives. Let me give an allegory to explain my point. Take the creator or god-like a manufacturing plant for Apple, there's a blueprint for each prototype as to the specification and definitive characteristics that need to be manufactured and produced.  Once production commerces the output for each product remains the same as they‚Äôre all identical to one another because there is only but one blueprint for the iPhone. Now the plant won‚Äôt deliberately manufacture some of its iPhones at a higher standard than normal and some at a subpar level, that would just be ridiculous wouldn‚Äôt it? So once the iPhone is out it only depends on the user who possesses it how well does she or he utilizes its features and its full capabilities. Now that manufacturing plant is the ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù where the ‚ÄúCreator‚Äù or ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is manifesting life and we Humans are the iPhones. Now we‚Äôre all born the same and have an exponential capability to achieve anything we desire. We may be born in different circumstances, shapes, and sizes but that doesn‚Äôt take away the innate power that we possess. Yet once were born societal construct around us infiltrates our minds and makes us feel redundant and work like modern slaves being control by external factors whatever that may be. We as humans love to delegate responsibility and evade accountability. Whatever good happens because we did it and if there's anything bad then it's due to external reasons but not us. The majority of the population prays whether that is in a temple, home, or to an idol, we pray to better our lives to manifest our desires but in this process, we are differentiating ourselves from the supreme creator. You see as the above-mentioned analogy the universe is within us, God is within us but if we start to find outside of us then we‚Äôre creating a barrier between us and that energy. In essence, were making him superior because only someone superior to us will be able to grant our wishes if we can‚Äôt and this fallacy has penetrated the whole planet and made them believe that miracles happen but only if we pray externally. While were the one creating those miracles. Even if a person prays to an idol or in a temple they are creating positive outcomes in their lives by the sheer belief in that idol or temple's power to grant them their desires. But they forget that‚Äôs not the temple or the idol it's them and their faith and belief which is manifesting it. Now some wishes may be fulfilled and some may not but due to this frenzy and obsequiousness we fall prey to the rituals and customs which we feel are necessary and only if those are followed then can something be fulfilled. What we forget to realize is that we‚Äôre constantly creating our reality consciously or unconsciously. Take a moment and think about everything around you, from your family to the country and the government that‚Äôs governing. They‚Äôre being able to govern because we believe in their policies and even if we dissent they‚Äôre are those who do believe and like Aristotle famous hollowing middle-class theory, where the middle class has a sufficient amount of property and either one side of the demographic possess a lot and one side doesn‚Äôt possess at all, tyranny can take place from either side of the spectrum but its the middle class which keeps the balance and diffuses dissent or factions of any kind. The successful people they al, I believe realized the power of their mind and what they can do when they single-mindedly steadfast towards one goal and how the universe starts aligning itself to their goals but for that, you need to be determined and have persistent thoughts about what it is you desire and be in a state or condition where you‚Äôre able to receive it without being distracted by the 101 stimuli presented in our environment. I think I digressed here a bit but I do hope what I stated above makes a little sense, at least it does to me.


Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I have nothing against religion, sexual orientation, bigotry, or anything which could be contentious and fuel a debate. All I want to say is that in this world, we run after what can be termed as instant gratification such as material well being and forget that the true bliss is inner happiness whether you‚Äôre successful or not it doesn‚Äôt matter because success in itself is so subjective. For someone success could be financial independence, for another, it could be status or position in life and for someone, it could be to find happiness in the little things. Finding that bliss and happiness has been the most persistent question especially in 2020 and to be able to find that is to know who you are, and when I say who you are I mean not this body or identity but your should, what your heart calls for, what you would want to do but don‚Äôt because of society at large. If 2020 has taught us anything else is that the future is unpredictable, jobs, Colleges everything that we tirelessly work for can be gone in seconds and make us feel redundant and under-appreciated but then again why do we need validation from others. The only person who should validate you is you because you‚Äôre the most unique person ever to be born and it is true. Think of your own experiences, your journey, the situations or people you may have encountered in life, it's unique to you because of how you dealt with it and grew from it. So all you need to do is sit, for a minute and be grateful for all you have and then think about who you are and what do you want to be. Do you want to charter the safe territory of security or go the unconventional route of uncertainty but excitement to find your purpose?",1606301798.0
spirituality,How may one respond to being taken advantage of?,"I've been raised in an environment where asserting your needs is seen as being a ""hussy"". It took me quite a while to deprogram this irrational fear from me and though I've seen some significant improvements, I still find old habits die hard. I'm quite accustomed to being the ""low maintenance"" friend and being utterly terrified for asking for help. I give it quite readily, sometimes at great personal expense in the hopes it'll get reciprocated. But it rarely manifests that way. People I considered friends only kept in contact if they needed a favour, but if I simply needed someone to talk to, I'm met with radio silence.

 This has happened again today, where a man who has teased about wanting to date me (and knows my interest in him as I've quite stupidly confessed to him in the hopes of getting closer to him only to have his ego inflated), has made the effort to contact me unprompted...to ask me to run an errand for him. A stroke of courage had me confronting him in a joking manner (""haha i was wondering why you contacted me first"") and his response showed no remorse and annoyance with me because he did ask how I was first (which, really, is the barest minimum and lasted all of 10 seconds).

TL;DR: I'm trying to keep mindful that people are busy and that it's unreasonable for me to keep in constant contact, but it really is discouraging that people only ever contact me if they want something done for themselves. I recognise this bitterness isn't going to be good for me, so may I ask advice in how one can assert themselves without bitterness.",1606309392.0
spirituality,You are a new baby,"If you have been seeking liberation from suffering like me, having anxiety, depression, addiction issues, I wanted to share my own progress.

It‚Äôs like I see them now and can choose to just ‚Äúgo back.‚Äù The more I do that, the more I feel like each moment is truly free from suffering. I dreamt last night I had a baby with no pain.

I love you all so much. Keep doing what you are doing. It‚Äôs ok to be the seeker. Sometimes you merge and feel that God, guru and self are one, and sometimes your mind may still entangle you. It‚Äôs ok to have desires. All these subs tell you what you should do and not many tell what to expect by doing it. You don‚Äôt have to get rid of anything or deny anything, but continue your practice as loving awareness and that is enough. You can expect more freedom, peace, hope, vibrancy, truth, and love.

spirituality,Freaking out - manifestation,"Okay so, let me first of start saying that since becoming more aware of manifestation and spirituality the more I realize I've been manifesting for myself and was naturally spiritually inclined ever since I was a kid.

Looking back at my childhood, whatever I wanted I literally got (not from being a spoilt brat point of view) but from life in general, friends, relationships, jobs, presents etc etc.

Three weeks ago I decided to do a manifesto board out of pure curiosity and as an experiment and let me tell you something, this shit? Yeah it works. 

Three weeks ago I put a picture of the cayman island's on my board and have been focusing on it before sleep and upon waking for about a week and half ish?

Yesterday I got an email from someone who works in the cayman islands offering me a job in the firm and sector I wish to work in. 

I'm not quite sure how all this works but I had an awakening 2 years and noticed synchronisation, third eye opening, manifestation, it's going to sound absolutely mad but when I had my awakening I felt ""god"" like I was literally covered in unconditional love and literally nearly all my thoughts manifested..?

It's sort of getting to the point now that whatever I hold in my consciousness, in my minds eye, in my imagination literally unfolds and manifests, I may have to wait a week or longer but whatever pictures I hold, whatever thoughts I hold consciously and consistently automatically arrive and manifest?

*""And there came one of the seven¬†angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of¬†the great whore¬†that sitteth upon many¬†waters:"" (Rev. 17:1)*

&lt;1&gt;The ""great whore"" refers to power and wealth which are gained in order to acquire a name or fulfill desires.¬†Water¬†is the symbol of the consciousness.¬†&lt;2&gt;Therefore, this great whore, which is to gain wealth and power in order to make a name, resides in the consciousness of many.

*""With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."" (Rev. 17:2)*

&lt;3&gt;""With whom the kings of the earth"" means those leaders in lower consciousness who have gained high positions in society will try to be a friend of this whore. They will try to gain fame and name for selfish purposes. They gained power and fame by hoarding wealth and imposing suffering on their people in order to gather more wealth, power, and fame.

&lt;4&gt;Also people on earth (in their lower natures) ""have been made drunk"" by following this whore, ""her fornication.""

*""So he carried me away in the¬†spirit¬†into the wilderness: and I saw a¬†woman¬†sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."" (Rev. 17:3)*

&lt;5&gt;It is the same beast as the one who was wounded and then healed (Revelation 13:1,2...). It is the power of desires toward the attraction of the external world (Maya). It is because of these desires (which are in the¬†subconscious mind) that people strive to gain wealth and power, in order to fulfill their longings.¬†&lt;6&gt;However, the human has a thirst for limitlessness, and when he directs this desire toward the external world which is limited and finite, he can never quench his thirst. The finite universe cannot satisfy infinite longings. Only spiritual knowledge which is infinite can satisfy that immeasurable thirst.

*""And the¬†woman¬†was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:"" (Rev. 17:4)*

&lt;7&gt;Wealth is symbolized by colorful dresses, gold, precious stones, pearls and other things that people become attached to as the wealth of the earth. If they become your master, you are lost.

*""And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."" (Rev. 17:5)*

&lt;8&gt;Therefore, ""Babylon the Great,"" that city which is always referred to as a¬†female¬†(woman), is this great whore. It is a great attraction of¬†Maya¬†and symbolizes the power and wealth when they are gained in order to inflict suffering on others, or in short, the¬†false ego.

*""And I saw the¬†woman¬†drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration."" (Rev. 17:6)*

&lt;9&gt;It is the fear of losing power and wealth that causes people to kill the¬†Prophets¬†and close their ears to the truth.

*""And the¬†angel¬†said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the¬†woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns."" (Rev. 17:7)*

&lt;10&gt;As we remember, this beast is the same as the first one in chapter 13 that came out of the sea. He had seven heads and ten horns, symbolizing the power of the desires toward¬†Maya. This beast is the false desires that make a man pursue the¬†Mayaistic and egoistic things and become more and more attached to the external world. And the desire of becoming famous, having power, making a name and fame for oneself, and fulfilling these desires, is related to the lower¬†chakras, or the lower self of the human.¬†&lt;11&gt;The¬†woman¬†here is the same as the lower nature of the human which is carried away by these desires, and these desires are that beast with the seven heads and ten horns.

*""The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."" (Rev. 17:8)*

&lt;12&gt;""The beast was, and is not"" means that it is true that the power of the¬†tama guna¬†is over the¬†Soul, but really the power of this guna is not, because it causes just an illusion of separation of man from¬†God¬†that, by His¬†Grace, can be overcome. When it is overcome, there is no beast, and it ""is not.""¬†&lt;13&gt;So it is just something to overcome (through The¬†Grace). That power is really the illusion of the attraction of the external world. People follow this illusion of the external world because of their¬†false egos, which is the whore, or the excess, unnecessary, and unspiritual desires which are, but if overcome, they are not.¬†

&lt;14&gt;These desires are created by the power of the¬†tama guna, and the power of the¬†tama guna¬†causes the lower nature to pursue the wanting of the external world. But when man reaches the higher nature or higher¬†chakras, this same beast (or the power of the¬†tama guna, the lower nature) will become a tool for humanity in pursuing the path to higher consciousness.

&lt;15&gt;""The beast...shall ascend out of the bottomless pit.""¬† The bottomless pit is the depth of¬†ignorance. ""And go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world.""¬† This refers to those who do not pursue the right path and in the many¬†incarnations again and again fail in realizing the human potential of be(com)ing¬†Divine. Instead they go more and more to¬†ignorance, and become more bound by the power of the¬†tama guna.¬†&lt;16&gt;""Behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.""¬† So for them the beast is.¬† For those who overcome (by His¬†Grace), it is not, and yet it is.¬† But even those who overcome it, if they are not one-pointed toward¬†God, they might go under its influence, and it becomes ""is"" again.

*""And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the¬†woman¬†sitteth."" (Rev. 17:9)*

&lt;17&gt;As it was described, these seven heads are the seven attractions of¬†Maya¬†which cause the lower nature to pursue them. This¬†woman, or the¬†lower nature of man¬†(that which is attracted to gaining name and fame from power and wealth) sits on these seven heads of the beast who came out of the sea (consciousness of man) (Rev. 13:1).¬†&lt;18&gt;Also most of the governmental systems of the earth (mountain) are based on these attractions (seven mountains).

*""And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space."" (Rev. 17:10)*

&lt;19&gt;Seven times this beast, or this attraction of¬†Maya, has defiled humanity. Before the¬†Prophets¬†or the¬†Angels of the church came, he was defiling humanity. After the first¬†Angel, some people did not believe him, so he defiled them. After the second time, his head was healed and he came back. He defiled the people again and caused them to go to their lower natures. The third¬†Angel¬†came, and so on. This is symbolized by, ""one of his heads as it was wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed:..."" (Rev. 13:3).¬†&lt;20&gt;So it will be seven times. And after the seventh¬†Angel¬†comes, he will be finished after a short period of time.

*""And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition."" (Rev. 17:11)*

&lt;21&gt;As it is described in chapter 20, ""the¬†dragon"" will be taken and locked up for a thousand years (a long period of time) after the Kingdom of¬†God¬†comes to the earth. However, after this time, ""he must be loosed a little season"" (Rev. 20:3), or the¬†dragon¬†would come back, but this period would be very short.

&lt;22&gt;This last coming after one thousand years (a long time after the Kingdom comes) would be the eighth time of ""the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth."" He is the same as the one who was destroyed as the seventh king, ""and is of the seven."" But it will eventually be destroyed, ""and when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed..."" (Rev. 20:7) but after a short time it will be destroyed, ""...was cast into the lake of fire...and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.""

&lt;23&gt;So the phrase, ""he is the eighth,"" refers to this last time of the fall of man and the last lesson humans will receive in order to understand the nature of the¬†devil¬†and the beasts, and to become rid of their¬†mark¬†(greed), and go to¬†Pure Consciousness, where the¬†Father¬†is.

*""And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast."" (Rev. 17:12)*

&lt;24&gt;It is these ten horns that are the by-products of the desires toward the attraction of¬†Maya¬†that have never gained any kingdom. It is always the beast itself, or the desire toward the attraction of¬†Maya, which is the king. They are the by-products of that king. It is true that the desire and attraction of¬†Maya¬†are what people try to overcome, but there will be a very short period of time when people will still be under the influence of these by-products. They will rule humanity with anger, vanity, and fear even after they overcome the false desires. Still these psychological problems will remain in humanity, but they will not last long. They will be lost very soon after the Kingdom Of¬†Heaven¬†comes.

*""These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast."" (Rev. 17:13)*

&lt;25&gt;These by-products of the beast will try to bring the beast back and to raise the desires of humanity.

*""These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful."" (Rev. 17:14)*

&lt;26&gt;The Lamb will fight with these¬†devils and overcome them by his spiritual powers, and by the faithful Elects.

*""And he saith unto me, The¬†waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."" (Rev. 17:15)*

&lt;27&gt;As was mentioned earlier,¬†water¬†is related to the consciousness of the human. So it is through the consciousness of man that this whore or this lower nature,¬†woman, will persuade humanity to do whatever she wants. It is in all the people, in all the multitudes, in all the nations, and all of the time. All of humanity is defiled by these desires, attachments, fears and all the things that are related to the lower nature in their consciousnesses through this¬†woman¬†(""waters...where the whore sitteth"").

*""And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.""*
*""For¬†God¬†hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of¬†God¬†shall be fulfilled."" (Rev. 17:16-17)*

&lt;28&gt;Anger, fear, vanity, unhappiness, cowardice, and all these things that are the by-products of pursuing¬†Maya, will come to the people. They will become completely lost and their desires will be unfulfilled more and more. These things will awaken the people to the realization that, ""We are following all these things because we are attached and attracted to the external world. Whatever we are following is just like chasing the¬†wind. This¬†Maya¬†is never going to be captured. We are never going to be able to obtain satisfaction through this¬†Maya.""¬†&lt;29&gt;And these horns, which will bring frustration to humanity, will destroy the¬†woman¬†or the lower nature, not by the desires of the people being fulfilled, but by desires not being fulfilled or a new desire arising after any previous desire is fulfilled. Eventually humanity will reach the point of understanding that life is not just for following the heedless desires.

&lt;30&gt;They will find out that it is not possible to fulfill all the desires. And when the desires are not fulfilled, anger, vanity, fear and attachment will come to them, and they will feel miserable and depressed. The by-products of the desires will cause them to realize that gaining name and fame is not the goal of life.¬†The Goal Of The Life Is To Be(come)¬†Divine.¬†So these ten horns will eat the flesh of the¬†woman¬†and burn her with fire, and they will completely destroy this part of the consciousness of the human. That is what¬†God¬†planned for and put in their hearts, to fulfill His Will.

&lt;31&gt;That is why the¬†tribulation¬†will come to the people.¬† The¬†tribulation¬†will be good for them, because after they go through it, they will reach the point of understanding that, ""This is not the goal of life.¬†¬†I am¬†following my own egoistical ways.¬†¬†I am¬†trying to do everything for my little 'I,' and¬†I am¬†always thinking about myself.¬† But¬†I am¬†not happy.""¬† And they will come to realize that this is not the way.¬†&lt;32&gt;The way is to be¬†God-conscious instead of self-conscious!

&lt;33&gt;These by-products of¬†Maya¬†will destroy¬†Maya¬†itself, by itself. That is why again we see that there is no¬†devil.¬†&lt;34&gt;Even the¬†tribulation¬†and becoming lost is a process for reaching a point of understanding that there is more to life than just pursuing the external world and its attractions.

*""And the¬†woman¬†which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth."" (Rev. 17:18)*

&lt;35&gt;This lower nature, or the attraction of¬†Maya, or the pursuance for fame and name, is what rules the world and all of humanity. All the humans will have these things, even the greatest Masters. They will have to overcome this attraction and the desires of the lower nature to reach their higher nature.¬†&lt;36&gt;And that is why the¬†woman¬†""reigneth over the kings of the earth."" This lower nature has caused the kings to be so wrathful and egoistical. They think it is their might or power that has caused them to become kings, instead of realizing that it was the might and power of¬†God¬†that allowed them to become kings.

spirituality,Lets talk about personal encounters with spirits/ghosts you've had in your life.,"Ive spoken to somebody not long earlier on the subject of ""hauntings"" and seeing as i grew up in a haunted home it really has brought alot of memories up for me. We all lived there from me being 8 years old right up to late teens (19). 
Ive mentioned it before in my post history im sure of it. I want to give you some examples of what we as a family used to live with and id like to hear any of yours too. Then i got a question to wrap things up with.
All of this is my experience and family experiences only, theres quite a lot so im gonna number them and if anybody wants to talk on it, please say and ill tell you more. 

1) Spirits are either ""resident"" and are always in the home/dwelling or they are ""visiting"" meaning they are active at times and dormant at others. Do they actually leave during these dormant times? I dont know, they could be present and just not active at all... But it is easier to explain this way plus i do feel they do ""go somewhere"" i dont know where thats all. 

2) We come to get to know 4 seperate and distinct spirits who were visiting our home for well over a decade. The most common was what felt to us all a pair of children. Girls specifically. They had a playful, mischeivious type of energy and interacted with us the most out of all 4 spirits. The form they took the most was a small in height ""shadow figure"". We would all sit and watch TV with the door to leave the room in our view but not focused on as we watch TV etc and you would see a dark black shadow figure ""peak their head round the door frame"" spying on us but as soon as youd go to look you would just catch the last tail end ducking quickly away. They were curious and made alot of knocks, bangs and footsteps upstairs whilst the family are entirely all downstairs. It seemed a bit like they were tearing around playing or something... We also used to hear childish giggling sounds too. Like a kid in the middle of a game witha friend but never actually heard any words from them. The favourite thing they seemed to do was hiding possessions that you literally right by you minutes before when you know you haven't left the room. Only for it to turn up in the most bizzare places for a fact you *definitely* didnt go. House keys, mobile phones, money, tobacco, letters etc. It seemed more likely to hide things that are personal like keys or phones than a letter or something else. I have left my phone on a living room table and left the room for 30 seconds max, to come back and the phones gone. Im alone in the house and my phones turned up inside the fridge as a stand out example. This is why we saw them as kids making up pranks on us. Occasionally we saw things move by themselves and an ex gf of mine burst into tears because she said a set of keys came flying through the door by themselves once. Or tea towels set on the side suddenly flip over etc. It never seemed to be directed at anybody though.

 3) After that was two seperate entities, they didnt specifically give us the impression as clear as the children, only the feeling of a presence. Im assuming that they were human, but they didnt expressly show us this for or against. One was at best ambivalent to us living in the home and this was the next most likely to be active. The second presence didnt seem to occur often but it was distinctly ""scary"" and didnt seem to like us at all. We will call the non scary presence Happyspirit and the bad Scaryspirit so you keep track. Happyspirit seemed to be able to mimick voices of people who lived in the house when they werent there. For example, my mum once called me when i was out playing football as a teen demanding i stop messing around and come down for dinner. She swears blind she shouted upstairs for me and ive responded back two or three clear phrases in my voice dead on. But, she was home alone. It seemed to be more likely that we would ""feel"" the happy spirit and the scary one rather than see them. Happyspirit for example would often give us a feeling like somebody is running right behind you on the stairs, almost like breathing on your neck. I would very often feel like somebody is watching me/is keeping an eye on me. Both the scary and the ambivalent spirit both seemingly had a voice where the children only made giggling sounds occaaionally. If you imagine a moody teen whos stomping about the house in a bad mood with you for taking his xbox away for a bad school report thats not a bad way of seeing it. Not scary because its your child but very brooding and pensive. The scaryspirit only was active rarely and was again not particularly visible but made itself known with extreme cold or hot spots no matter what season it is outside. It made a room feel exceptionally uncomfortable, like a feeling of dread would hit alongside sometimes one of us would suddenly cry or get super angry out of nowhere. I think its as a result of the subconscious tension we all felt by this entity. It was the only scary spirit and it felt like it actively was hugely against us. It had a horrible ability to make a growling noise. Imagine a snarl like a wolf looking at you as lunch. Its like that but it seemed to get heard right beside your ear like its right behind you. It made alot of strange, mechanical almost but unnatural crunching/twisting/unsettling sounds that were difficult to explain what the hell they were. Being scared of it seemed to make it worse / more likely to happen again / last for longer at a time. It was a bit like being followed by a invisible but malevolent cloud who is trying its best to scare you and make bad things happen to us. 

4) Certain things triggered them into becoming more active in the house. For sure, if a new person came to visit or stay over it would usually mean more activity in a flurry about the home. Almost like they were stirring and unsettled by a strangers presence. (Stranger as in not the family who lived there). It seemed to us that they get used to people and recognise who is new who is known etc, so therefore its possible for a spirit to have an opinion on you and act accordingly, like we can do to somebody in life. 

5) I dont think that all spirits are humans that arent in a body anymore. In fact the entities all seemed to be a little... Lacking id say. As in they werent fully formed individuals. It felt more like an aspect of a person to some degree like a fragment thats in a kind of loop. We didnt know if they are looped by choice or if they dont know. The child like shadow people i first described felt like kids but the third and fourrh spirits didnt give a human like feel. Especially the evil intentioning one, where they didnt give a human feel to me they didnt specifically give any real clues to what they were. They felt specifically like ""presences"" and didnt show as shadows at all. BUT could copy voices/make any sound it seemed. Our animals used to behave very strangely and seemed to watch things happening in thin air. Our german shepherd was a brave girl but she on occasion acted really freaked out, which made us worse because its not like a dog is embellishing a reaction to get a response or scare us... How her eyes would track the room was spooky and dogs arent capable of lying.

6) When my nan died, not long after me and my mum was in our downstairs kitchen while she did the washing up looking out of a big window onto our back garden. My dad and brother were outside doing something with the shed padlock. It was September time and around 5pm so not dark as its still summer light hours but it was overcast and grey. Between me and my mum id say a basketball sized 3d ball of bright white light appeared, drifted between me and her (who were maybe 1m apart facing eachother talking) before sharply turning towards the ceiling and dissapearing. We thought maybe dad shined a torch in on us at first. But it was too light to have that affect and it was 3d like i said. She lived with us for a time when i was young looking after us. But she died of lung cancer and was ill in our home. Was that her?

7) Before the orb, my nans husband and my grandad died when i was 6 or 7 of Parkinson disease. Progressive super nuclear palsy to be precise. On the day of his wake, with the cab outside and everybody putting jackets on to leave i am with my dad and were in the kitchen. I go to the sink and dad pours me some water from the tap inside a clear glass mug of snoopy and peanuts. That was my grandads cup, and just as i bring it to my lips to sip i shit you not but the glass shatters into tiny pieces literally inches from my face. Not a single bit of glass cut me at all. Extremely bizzare and i promise the truth. I regularly must sound deranged saying these things but i have no need to lie. In fact im a medical professional so these things are even more seen as bullshit or an issue in that sense

I watched some of Mooji‚Äôs videos and listened to him on some podcasts, and his words and presence really resonated with me. He described his concepts with such simple elegance and it seemed to be coming from personal experience. I got the impression that he was an enlightened being.

How then, can a person with seemingly such wisdom, be alleged to be abusive and manipulative behind the scenes? [see the allegations here](https://gurumag.com/becoming-god-inside-moojis-portugal-cult/)

Same thing with Swami Rama, someone who can raise his heart rate to 300bpm through breathing techniques and achieving higher states of consciousness. While Yogi Bhajan, the man credited with bringing Kundalini yoga to the west, also has similar allegations. 

I can‚Äôt understand how people can achieve high states of consciousness without living through love and virtue. Isn‚Äôt that the core premise of being ‚Äòenlightened‚Äô? So are these people just straight scammers and not enlightened at all, or can you achieve these high states of consciousness but still be abusive etc? I just can‚Äôt see how that is possible. 

Or, am I just too gullible and naive to see that they are fraudulent lol.

spirituality,Controlling Thoughts," Normally, we are all slaves to our thoughts and once a thought is in charge of our life, the thought becomes feeling, the feeling leads to action. Therefore, it is very important to try to control thoughts. The mind is like a thought factory. It produces thoughts and these thoughts depend on the raw material we feed the mind ‚Äì the emotions we feed the mind. The kind of emotions we feed our mind, positive or negative, will determine the kind of thoughts the mind will produce. However, if we evolve spiritually, and we put our intellect in charge of our mind, then we will be able to control our thoughts. If we spend time in silence, and we try to subdue the mind's aggressiveness, then that meditation can create consciousness, that can control the mind.",1605723189.0

spirituality,Reflections on the meaning for my life and its relationship with money...,"Im young. After I became deeply involved with spirituality I started thinking about what type of life I want to live and I came to the conclusion thats it is one where I can experience every facet of human experience that is available and viable to us on earth. 

I love traveling so I want to see every place there is to see; I want to follow my career passion until it no longer interests me; i want to live in different places; i want to understand what it means to live frugally, simply; i want to meet different people and understand different point of views; i want to push the boundaries of my spiritual being and live and study in a buddhist temple for some time; i want to help people and the environment and explore my deepest connection, which is with nature...

Yes, ambitious, but its certainly what I find beauty in and not just something I want to do for fulfillment purposes.

Up until yesterday, the value of money for me was that I would need enough of it so that I could accomplish these things without having to worry too much about my financial situation. So enough, but not a lot. Im not heavily attracted to money although my career centers around it.

However, recently i started thinking about how it would be like to be wealthy, and observe the consequences of that as human being. I associated that to my desire to experience all facets of life and now I think its something I also want to attain at some point, mostly out of curiosity. I dont know if this is coming from a truthful place or not but it seems like it is. It also could very well be some illusion ive created to motivate myself or to excuse some hidden love for power and money that I didnt know I had.

spirituality,Suffering.,"Currently going through probably one of the hardest moments of my life right now, struggling with dissociation/derealization/depersonalization. It is very hard, However I know that I must go through this in order to become stronger. Its all meant to be. I know that I can and will make it out stronger than I was before, however whenever the symptoms get very bad i wonder why I was made to feel these super strange feelings. I know that these are all just thoughts and that anxiety should have no power over me, however it is something I feel is out of my control at the moment. I know that I have anxiety, that the thoughts in my head are just that, thoughts. However I still must go through having the illness, and experiencing something that I would not even wish on my worst enemy. Even though I feel as if I have conquered and have identified my anxiety, I still must suffer because of it. Why do I have to endure this pain when I have already learned my message from it?

spirituality,Society no longer cares about individual rebellion.,"Society no longer cares about individual rebellion. People are too busy, worked half to death, to care about your public revolt. Even if they notice, they won't take it seriously because it goes against their means for survival. They know that you can't exist without playing by the rules: job, taxes, loans. The people who pull the strings let you get away with it, knowing that you'll be back, working the machine in due time. They want people to live with the illusion of freedom and choice. Our public tantrums function as reverse psychology, as they enable a safe outlet for our frustrations, having us believe that we achieved something through opposing social norms. Yet, the energy that we put into them only weakens our energy that should be put into effective opposition. Social revolutions ended long ago, and whatever you see now is designed to be there, serving a purpose for those who permit it. We're all chained to the system no matter how outwardly you project your protest. Unfortunately, social protest has become part of the mainstream norm, personal image, ego, how people identify, and not about making a difference. When you go against the game, you lose.

spirituality,Should I be worried?,"(PLEASE KEEP AN OPEN MIND)
Hi, 

I'm Balen,
I've been practicing spirituality for the majority of my life. When I was young I would have vivid dreams, ( I had a dream where I woke up in my room and saw a evil red eyed dog at the foot of my bed, and it bit my leg, I woke up with excruciating pain on my leg, I was around the age 8-9). I meditate and practice chakra opening and balancing. I have my filters blown off on my senses, I feel everything so severely and sensitively which has made me a good helper/therapist. I learned a lot about life from a young age due to being exposed to a very abusive household when I was little (I am away from there and in a much better place now)

Im going to let you know about a few things before I get into whats worrying me, a few things I have experienced when I was little. 

When I was young I would have frequent headaches (psychic?) and color flashes (my vision would get flooded with color and I'd get a very painful headache)  and I would have very grown up conversations with adults from a very young age. I used to (still do) have very vivid dreams, in some cases I would actually get hurt in these dreams, or guided in these dreams. A few reoccurring ones are; Im in a forest clearing, completely surrounded by trees, suddenly black shadow figures would emerge from behind these trees with bright glowing eyes and chase me, I would get a intense buzzing feeling and it would always end with them standing over me and slowly getting closer till I'd wake up in a cold sweat with a horrid headache. And another one is I'd be in a city, covered in fog and getting chased by something, and the world would get darker and darker until I'd wake up again in a sweat. Another one is Im back at my abusive childhood home and im desperately running up the stairs to the front door (we lived in a flat, and the front door was upstairs (three floors) and every floor that I would go up would show a memory, but it would be twisted grotesquely, I kept having this dream until I finally made it out the front door (getting over a dark time?) 

Now to the bit that has happened recently that I need some advice with, please be honest and kind. I know there's probably scientific explanations for all of this  but I like to believe there's a little more to life than the scientific explanation.  Please be respectful and remain open minded. 

So last night I believe I experienced my first out of body experience. I thought it was sleep paralysis (and it may be) but I've had it before and this time felt completely different. I woke up at 2:53am, the number has stuck with me. I was thirsty and needed to use the bathroom so I did so, however I had a really off, queasy feeling the entire time, and I had a pressure in the middle of my forehead (third eye?). As I went back to ""sleep"", I woke but my body wasn't awake it was locked in sleep, and I knew this wasn't a dream because I felt the covers and air around me and the smell of the cool outside. I opened my eyes but my eyes still felt closed. And what I saw was my room but it felt different, like I was in the same place but a different plane of existence, everything felt not entirely there, like I was floating in space inside my material room. I felt present but non-existent. I then saw seven black orbs floating infront of me. I have to say during this time, my body felt like my atoms were on speed, my whole body was buzzing/vibrating, a type of sensation so overpowering i have never experienced before. The orbs scared me, gave me a looming sense of dread, so much so I seemed to return to my body and say ""move move move"" (my body to move) I focused on my fingers and they twitched and suddenly I was awake, out of that plane of being, shaken but intrigued. Every time I'd try to go back to sleep it would take me back there, and I'd force myself awake every time until I gave up and woke at half 5 am. I am very tired. 
Does anyone have a clue what happened to me? 
Today I have just had this looming sense of something wrong, something not quite right, some sort of energy looming overhead. 

Any and all feedback would be appreciated.  

I'll keep you guys updated.

spirituality,"Unconditionality within Positive and negative Thoughts, Circumstances, and Actions.","Everything you experience is neither positive or negative. If a thought, circumstance, or action is labeled positive, then that exact same circumstance, thought, or action must also hold the label of being able to express negative. If a thought, circumstance, or action held the absolute truth of only being able to be interpreted as positive, it can no longer be recognize as being something positive because the lack of being able to express negative would not exist. When anything is labeled as being positive, in order for it to be distinguished as such, it‚Äôs polar opposite must also be recognizable within the same exact thought,  circumstance, or action. Therefore, everything (thoughts, actions, and circumstances) truly rests in the center of their potential polar expressions, and is never at one point either positive or negative. Unconditionality comes into play as the thought, circumstance, or action has the ability to express both positive and negative ideas. Which also means that it is still resting in the center waiting for someone to give it meaning and interpretation. However, it is now the illusion of being interpreted in any one way and has not truly become either, as it is also has the ability to be opposite at the exact same time, which means it still has not ‚Äúmoved‚Äù from its core center of actually being neither. How are these thoughts,  circumstances, and actions interpreted as having meaning? Your beliefs about them is how we decide to label anything as being positive or negative in order to have the experience associated to both ideas. But we must remember at the core of our being, our beliefs are actually manipulating them by taking away their unconditionality and molding them into conditional expressions. When we perpetually do this on a daily basis, we are now unconsciously believing in this illusion of controllability (by assigning absolute meaning to everything) which then makes the individual, experience their idea of negativity because you cannot control an illusion. I say illusion because we assumed that the thought, circumstance, and action hold absolute meaning and we never allowed the idea of it being able to express anything else. If it has the ability to be both positive and negative, then it is the illusion that we assign it as only this way and not that way. When we dissolve this belief, and understand that belief is a tool that allows us to have the ability of assigning meaning. We reign in our illusion of control, and that was the control that nothing must mean something. That now takes off this self inflicted weight we all seem to carry by interpreting that our life is happening to us, with a new understanding that life is actually happening from us as the true experience is not what happens to you, but rather from within you. Because the true experience is the emotion and feeling associated with such ideas (thoughts, circumstances, and actions), not what you interpreted through the physical senses. And if life is happening from us, with nothing having absolute meaning because of its unconditionality. We can change our perception to understand that positive and negative thoughts, circumstances, and actions as something we can consciously label (as long as we understand that it does not make it absolute). If we can consciously turn nothing into something, then we can experience a life of freedom, now that life is truly happening from us. Which gives us the ability to decide that at any point in our life whether past, present, or future was/is actually positive (if you choose to) regardless of any previous experience. Just because an experience was/is associated with your old understanding of being negative or positive, does not negate the importance of that experience as it was/is one of many steps needed to take to realize you were already free with the illusion of control. Importance is not biased towards negative or positive, it simply just is and we can confuse important ideas as being as such. Just another example of emptiness with unconditional potential. This understanding is universal with all ideas that have the ability to express their polar opposites. In order for this truth to be true to you and not just for me, your belief system (which can either hold you prisoner or give you ultimate freedom) must be understood first.

spirituality,"I want to believe in judeo-christian religion, but am just so put off by the stories.","I grew up in a very strict Christian household, and I was given a decent Christian education on the Bible (when I was young I actually read it cover to cover).

I now consider myself agnostic- I don't know &amp; most days I don't care to know.

But some days I long for spiritual expression. I am most interested in Judaism, but when I read a recommended book on the basics of Judaisn- I couldn't get past the first chapter where it discussed Moses &amp; the burning bush. I just cannot believe these basic religious stories.

I dont want to be one of those religious people I detest so much (no offense, I'm sorry), where they claim to be a practicing member of some religion- yet know nothing about the religious text &amp; live a secret life of sin, while putting on an angel face at church every Sunday. I feel like following a religion whose basic stories I dont believe in would make me like those people.

spirituality,I can't help but feel happy that the world is actually slowing down for a change,"**Edit:** There seems to be some confusion and misundertanding. To be clear I am not saying that the COVID-19 outbreak is good. It is incredibly sad how many people are sick and dying and how many hospital workers are overwhelmed. This is someone's mother, father, grandmother, grandfather or sibling who is affected. I have a lot of sympathy for them and it sucks that they have to go through this. This pandemic is **not a good thing and that is not what I am happy about**.

**Edit 2:** Here's an article how 77,000 lives were saved in China just by reducing air pollution alone: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2020/03/16/coronavirus-lockdown-may-have-saved-77000-lives-in-china-just-from-pollution-reduction/#35c09aee34fe

This post is only to point out the silver lining of this terrible outbreak. We desperately needed this pause in society and to pause the cog in the capital machine because climate change is accelerating at an alarming pace. It sucks that it took a deadly pandemic to do this but people would not have slowed down otherwise. We had to pause our industry and emissions at some point or face the dire consequences of rising heat levels and sea levels.

TL;DR: While people are suffering the negative economic consequences of COVID-19, I am mildly happy that it happened because the world is finally slowing down and the environment is finally able to breathe for a while. Mother Earth deserves a break from all the exploitation we have done to Her.

This world has always been about maximum productivity, profit and constantly pacing. At least this is the case for the 21st century. The demand for the newest smartphone every year, new clothes every so often, extreme amounts of meat and food to consume is breaking our poor Mother Earth. 

She gives us everything we need and more. But somehow, we decided that we need to suck out the blood of the Earth to feed this insatiable hunger that most people have. That has led to the current climate crisis and our infinite desire has also fueled ignorance.

Now with the COVID-19 outbreak, the world is actually slowing down for the first time. Schools, offices, studios, factories and so many places are shutting down. People are being advised to stay home and travel less. The result has been outstanding on the environment. The waters of Venice are clear and cities in China have reduced NO2 emissions and they have clear air. 

Mother Nature loves us and she will do everything for us. But we, as a species have returned the favour with greed and lust. Now we are finally facing the consequences of what happens if you take things too far. I am not saying that I advocate for death and we deserve what's happening. The current situation is simply the consequences of our sometimes really bad actions.

People are losing money, the economy is slowing down and there are fears of a global recession. That doesn't bother me in the slightest, even if it was me in that situation. I am just happier that Mother Earth finally gets a break, even if it's very shortlived. We have done enough damage to Her. Sadly, I know we will go back to our normal ways once this is done. 

We are here on this Earth for a short time. Living in harmony with the environment and with your community is an extremely important part of this life. I wonder what it will take for people to satisfy their infinite hunger inwards and with God/The Universe instead of this material world and without draining the blood of Mother Earth.",1584345936.0

spirituality,"My brother and I were in a car accident as children. He suffered a traumatic brain injury, and died multiple times before going into a coma and recovering. I recently asked him what he experienced...","Backstory (skip to ‚ÄúStory‚Äù if tldr): (24M) have an older brother, Mike 26M) with whom I share a very strong bond. After I was born, Mike and I were inseparable. I was his number two of sorts. Mike was incredibly smart for his age, and at 7 was planned to fast track elementary school by a year or so. He was wicked smart. Mike and I early on began sharing out-of-body experiences. We often told our parents about experiencing astral projection and sleepwalking. I was talking to my neighbor who‚Äôs lived next to us our whole lives. She‚Äôs a very spiritual woman like my father. She said that when we were kids we would often separately describe dreams we had, but experienced congruently and shared in sleep. In retrospect, we were lucid dreaming, like most children. Anyways, Mike and I had a very strong, spiritual bond that resulted in a lot of ESP-like experiences.

In 2001, we were both in a near fatal car accident when a drunk driver ran a red light and t-boned our car with my 7 year old brother in the front seat. His head was hit by the truck through the window, his brain slammed the lefts side of his brain, and his head came back to red in the grill of the truck. I (5 at the time) was unbuckled and went flying under the seats where I was pinned. I lost consciousness instantly, but I survived with a broken collar bone. My brother was not so lucky. Mike nearly died on impact. He had severe brain bleed and was rushed to the hospital. That night, he nearly died multiple times. He honestly never should have lived, and it is, without a doubt, a miracle he is alive. My mother has an incredible story about the power of prayer, but that‚Äôs a for another post. 

Story: Mike is alive today and doing well. He could never make a full recovery as the damage to his brain was too severe. He lives an entirely different life now because of his disability. Externally, it all seems incredibly tragic, and in many ways it is, but Mike is one of the happiest, and most spiritually connected people I‚Äôve ever met. He had a ton of incredible experiences when he was in a coma. Mike, over the years, has been able to recall some of his experiences. Unfortunately, my parents each have their own brand of spirituality/religion so they projected a lot of their beliefs onto his experience. I decided to ask Mike again what he experienced right after the car hit. I was expecting Mike to say he couldn‚Äôt possibly remember, and of course his disability severely inhibited his memory. But no, he launched into what happened with little hesitation and spoke with an irregular clarity. 

Right after he was hit by the car, Mike said the force of the impact pushed him out of his body. He said he rose above the car, and could see everything. My father interjected to say he was flying around, and I quickly asked Mike if that‚Äôs what he meant. He said no, but rather he felt everything. That his sight was less physical and more innate. I almost cried when he said the next part. My brother is still very smart considering what he‚Äôs been through, but his disability makes it hard for him to understand some concepts. But he said that while he was feeling everything around him, he also had this knowledge that he was a part of everything but at the same time nothing. This was pretty heavy for him so asked him to go further. ‚ÄúWe have two selves, and I knew I wasn‚Äôt my body.‚Äù I was blown away. He‚Äôs never talked like this. Mike typically said he met a version of God, spent years in ‚Äúheaven‚Äù and then made a promise to sacrifice part of himself to return. He‚Äôs always talked about a duality of self, but never like that. He went on to say something that sounded like an alternate timeline to avoid death. It‚Äôs hard for him to remember and harder to make sense of it all. He is confident that he spent a significant amount of time in an alternate plane of existence that is ‚Äúinside‚Äù not ‚Äúabove‚Äù he would remind.

He‚Äôs a remarkable human and I hope to learn more about his experiences. He remembers things from being in a coma but not what happened 3 minutes ago. It‚Äôs tough to piece everything together, but I know whatever my brother went through caused his awakening (at a great cost). I‚Äôm going to keep an active dialogue with him and try to record everything into a sort of timeline, although he said time was pretty non-existent.

spirituality,am I the only one who wants to start a spiritual commune and live in nature away from civilisation?,"EDIT #3:
Alright, since some people do not have a FB account, here's the sub: r/communers

EDIT #2:
So, a good bunch of people have shown interest in starting some sort of self-managed commune(s). The imagined form of such commune(s) varies from one person to another.

This is far too early to talk of any serious project, but since there seems to be some serious interest in this, I thought of creating a Facebook group in order to connect and keep these people in touch.

Let's be very clear about it: the intended goal of this group, at least so far, is not to start something tomorrow morning, but rather to build a community of like-minded people. From there on, if this community manages to grow, it will serve as a starting point for people to come together and actually start something.

It will also allow each of us to indicate our location and describe how we can help (skills, knowledge, financial participation, ressources,... and so on).

I had to come up with a name to create the Facebook group, so I choose ""Communers"", but of course we can change that.

As you noticed, my original post contained the word ¬´¬†spiritual¬†¬ª. I‚Äôve decided not to use this word anymore, since spiritual/religious practices are personal.

Quit my stressful job that was ruining me on many levels. I moved away from family that was abusive and controlling towards me. 
I had fake friends that didn't give 2 shits about me. I realize the friend I've needed most is myself and the divine. 
Today I'm in Flagstaff, Arizona. No concrete plans. Just know I'm here to heal myself, start a new path, and pursue my calling in life as a psychic/empath/spiritual healer/guide.
Though the road seems so uncertain right now and I have many many doubts and the logical part of me is wondering what even tf is wrong with me for doing this..
I've felt afraid since I got here. No plans, no contacts. I'm lost. Been without a phone a whole day. But our ancestors survived on much much less. 
But I've also been guided.. the clock says 636 right now. I went to McDonald's my receipt said 222, I went to sizzler, my total was 555. I make a wrong turn and I'm filled with doubt, turns out I was meant to make that wrong turn and I see 7777. 

The energy here is so much, too much for me ego to process or understand. 
I now see the power in being such a sensitive empath. In the city I'm at the mercy of others so often, but out here in the wilderness I am king. Power and healing energy flows through me at such an intensity that everything stopping me from finding my true self is purged immediately in waves.

I know not where I go next, nothing feels certain being so damn empathic and socially anxious. But I can do this. It's such a difficult thing to trust. My logical mind can't take such a degree of freedom after living with controlling narcissists my whole life. 
Im completely free now and I don't know how to handle it. 
Please pray for me and send lots of loving and healing energy. I'm rooting for all of you that find difficulty in trusting. I'm rooting for all of you that have felt so chained, and controlled by others.


Edit: about to go drive from Flagstaff to Sedona right now. I feel such an outpouring of love from many of you, I'm almost in tears. The energy is very palpable. Im extremely grateful, after my adventure today we'll talk some more. 
Thank you again ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit update: I was meditating on Bell Rock with my aura down.. I felt the pain of so many, raw pain, sadness, anger, confusion. 
And then i was told ""your path is to love this too, to learnt to rise above this and empower yourself. Since you take on others pain and empower yourself regardless, your purpose is to understand people in ways that are above their current level of consciousness and then empower them to learn how to do this for themselves. 
Basically to learn to trust yourself no matter what, because as you trust yourself you will empower others to trust themselves."" 
And i broke out in tears.

spirituality,Schools should teach children mindfulness,"Many people and children are suffering of a depression. Or they are destructive towards themselves and sometimes even other people.

Many depressions or depressed feelings are caused by the fact that children start to feel like they are not good enough. This is one of the results of raising children in a system where there almost always is an illusionary goal that should be achieved. And only when they achieve the goal they feel like they did a great job. Like they're good enough.

But there is no ultimate goal. Everything is connected. Everything exists because of the surroundings so everything is one. Let's call this one big thing the universe. Are we as the universe going to somewhere? Do we need to achieve a goal? No we don't. So let's teach children this so they start to enjoy life at every moment.

Of course there are also illusionary goals outside of schools. That's why I think that it would be useful to teach children how to observe their thoughts. Because then they will learn to not get caught up by depressing thoughts. And when they will also learn to live in the present moment, they will really see the beautiful things of life because they are not living in their head.

So together with knowledge about life, observing thoughts, and living in the present moment. There will probably be less depressed children.

spirituality,Don‚Äôt wear your spirituality as a badge.,"Often in the spiritual community, you see people ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and discover a whole new world that they‚Äôve been missing in their life. It‚Äôs new, it‚Äôs exciting. You‚Äôre finally understanding what all your favorite philosophers mean, you feel a real connection with the world around you, you understand your suffering is a human concept, you just ‚Äúget it‚Äù and what do you want to do? You want to share it with EVERYONE! 

Sharing your newfound knowledge leads to some harsh judgments. You unintentionally show your inflated spiritual ego thinking that you can change everyone around you to think like you and be like you. You think by doing so, you will help their life be better for them. It worked for you, you want to see your friends, family, and coworkers happy and free from the suffering of this world, right? 

We must remember that the path to spiritual enlightenment is not a destination, it‚Äôs the road that we all walk. We must remember that every person is on their own special journey in life, many of which will never ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and that‚Äôs okay. We must remember that our light, our compassion, our actions, and leading by example is how we change those around us, not by preaching and judgment. 

Yes, I also get frustrated by closed-minded, materialistic, ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù (for a lack of a better word, I apologize), but instead I consciously do my best to greet them with kindness and compassion, not judgment. Not knowing or seeing the world as I do does not make them any less than me. Or better. I like to describe it as being on a different plane of existence than they are. Not better, not higher, just different. They will either have a spiritual awakening at some point in their life, or they won‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs okay. They are still a human like I am, with their own struggles and experiences and emotions and dreams and desires. Just because they do not see the world as I do does not make them wrong. 

Learn to appreciate each human life for exactly what it is, rather than try to change them. Lead by shining your light, not by judging and preaching. Let go of any notion that you‚Äôre somehow ‚Äúbetter‚Äù because you‚Äôre ‚Äúwoke‚Äù. Love a lot more, judge a lot less.

spirituality,Are people starting to realise that the systems we have created no longer serves us?,"All of us here know that in this life we will have to die to ourselves and be reborn multiple times. This metamorphosis into new life and growth is certainly not alien to us. Such transformation is usually marked by a period of darkness and depression, before we shed away the old and break through to what life awaits. 

From what I can see, the human collective is currently going through its dark night of the soul. Everywhere we see how our systems, the collective ego, no longer serves us. It no longer pushes us to grow and evolve. We all know what happens when we try to cling to dying egos...the universe will *force* us to die. The more we hold on to our neuroses the more painful it becomes.

Everyone reading this has insecurities and fears, but the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. It‚Äôs all inside of your head, let it out. Share your story, share your journey, share your life you are the person that you are because of your experience, the books that you have read and the people who you have shared or had your life interrupted by.

You didn‚Äôt ask to be born, you didn‚Äôt choose your family, you were born innocent. So never feel guilty for existing, if you have privileges acknowledging them and then taking down barriers that have been placed in the way of others, will set you free.

Mental barriers that we all develop over time, because we have been hurt, wisdom coming from pain‚Ä¶.But now they imprison us, some find it difficult to love, so difficult that they never love again.

Many develop spiritual barriers, never really connecting with themselves, because they are scared of what they will find within their own thoughts, they are worried about what they have buried deep within in their subconscious. Worry is interest paid in advance on a debt that you may never owe. Building up emotional debts to yourself is horrible.

spirituality,Social media is holding us back,"I feel as though social media is one of the main contributing factors holding us back from true spiritual evolution.

Social media keeps us stuck in the ego. We think that others want to know what we‚Äôre doing, where we‚Äôre going. We love sharing about ourselves and being the center of attention on social media platforms. It keeps us stuck in our ego and disconnected from the whole. I‚Äôm tired of spending my life just to take a nice picture to get that dopamine rush when ‚Äú27 people‚Äù like my picture or post. 

I‚Äôm so tired of living this way. I don‚Äôt like obsessing over how I look because of how someone else might perceive of me. I‚Äôm letting go.

The world would be a better place if we all stepped back from social media. If we all stopped obsessing about who we are and who we portray ourselves to be to others on the internet. 

And don‚Äôt even get me started on all of the spiritual teachers who claim to be so enlightened but their ulterior motive is the profits they gain from selling merchandise or crystals or jewelry. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs great that they are doing their business through social media and thriving but I feel like in spirituality, we are taught to let go completely. Of our self image/ego (which comes solely from how we dress.. wearing jewelry, certain types of clothes, expensive items) we put such an emphasis on living to impress others with our ‚Äúspiritual aesthetic‚Äù.. are we really even spiritual at all? 

I wish we‚Äôd all stop using social media and live completely in the moment. When our babies are born, instead of having a professional photographer in the room, we‚Äôd enjoy the precious moment fully without any cameras. When we go on vacation, we wouldn‚Äôt be worried about snapping the perfect picture to upload to Instagram, when we go to a concert, we‚Äôd watch the show in its entirety instead of recording 100s of videos that won‚Äôt ever compare to what we saw in person.

I just want us to recognize who we are and how disconnected we‚Äôve become through social media. I‚Äôm going on 3 weeks no Facebook, no Twitter, no Instagram.

And if we're not sure, there will be flocks of people happy to point it out to us.  Look no further than this sub!

You wanna fuck?  Fuck.  

Why do I get the feeling that we hold ourselves to an impossible standard in the name of spirituality?  Is that really spirituality?

Or is it more spiritual to just be the human being that you are?  You know, the fucking ANIMAL that you are. 

Y'all seen that movie *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*?  There's that scene where the gang discovers that they're not able to hide the fact that they took Cameron's father's Ferrari for a joyride.  And Cameron says at some point, **""I'm gonna take a stand, and I'm gonna defend it.  Right or wrong, I'm gonna defend it.""**

This looks to me like where integrity comes from. If not you're just gonna live your whole fucking life being pushed around.  It doesn't fucking matter if you're ""wrong"".  Own it.  Do what you feel to be right, FOR YOU, and be willing to eat the consequences, too.  But don't be so god damn wishy washy.

I'm not saying to be stubborn.  If you fall on your ass and find out you're wrong about something... then change!

But I feel like the spiritual path is not about some philosophical shit.  Don't hypothesize about truth. Fucking LIVE truth, or what you feel to be true. And when you make a mistake and fall on your ass, then you can learn.

But then it won't be some shit you read in a book, or shit someone told you and you took at face value. It's rooted in your being.

spirituality,It's OK to be happy.,"It's OK if you don't care about self-improvement, career goals, buying fancy stuff, ""making it"" in some way or another.  It's OK to just take naps and chill and play video games and dick around.  You gotta put food on the table but it's OK if you settle for a lower paying job that you like instead of a higher paying one that you don't.  It's OK for you to take help from your parents.  If's OK for you to take help in general.

It's OK to follow your intuition.  It's OK to listen to your heart.  It's OK to not take advice from anybody.  You don't have to be open minded, sometimes that stuff is just noise.

It's OK to show the world who you are.  You don't have to hide it.  You can just be honest.  You don't have to be your best self.  You can just be your self.  It's OK to love who you want to love.  It's OK to feel the way you feel.

It's OK to just do stuff because you like it rather than making a competition out of it.

It's OK to be selfish.  It's OK to do what you want.

It's OK if you're not perfect.  It's Ok if you get angry, get sad, have doubts sometimes and wonder if it's even all worth it.  None of that stuff is even a barrier to being at peace.  The only barrier to being to peace is being fake about it.

We put a lot of restrictions on ourselves, then we wonder why life sucks.  We never stopped to ask ""hey, what the hell do *I* want to do?""  No, we're always measuring ourselves up to some impossible standard and chasing the future.  We're afraid to follow our heart.  There seems to be safety in the crowd, even if the crowd is completely screwed.

At some point you gotta just stand up and say, actually, I don't think all that crap is for me.  I'm just going to love myself and be true to myself.  I'm just going to enjoy life, and live my life lovingly. I don't care if I have to go it alone.  I will go it alone.  Who knows?  I may inspire others.  But above all, I deserve it.

It's natural for us as humans to analyze the way that we measure up to the others around us, but that doesn't mean we have to allow it to influence the ways we view ourselves. 

Jealousy can be a very hard issue to deal with, but when we truly find self love and find contentment in our own presence, the approval or thoughts of others about us and our lives won't affect us as much. In my most descent video, I talk about how to get over jealousy, and some methods that helped me. 

These are just a few tips that have helped me in my own journey, and I hope that they help you as well.

spirituality,To Myself &amp; You,"I am so proud of you. Really, I am. Thinking about how much you have grown as a person. I know sometimes you worry about not living up to your potential, but the fact that you have come so far in such a short amount of time means you will grow so much more. You are incredible, for making small steps to discover yourself and life. This is the year of letting go and trusting the universe. Somehow, everything is working out. I want to continue to let go of my ego, work on being a better person, stay humble, and heal the world in some way.

I don't know what the future holds but I am excited. It will require me to step outside my comfort zone and really test my spiritual growth. Not only test, but for you to grow even more. Life is about learning to ride the waves better. I love you, unconditionally. All parts of you. The developed, underdeveloped, and undeveloped. You are whole as you are. There is nothing you will find externally that you cannot find internally.¬†",1593114393.0
spirituality,Today is 7 years clean and sober for me. Here's what I've learned.,"Hey folks!   I used to go support groups in the beginning, and that was most helpful to me!  If you're interested in knowing which ones, drop me a comment.  Anyway, one cool part about those groups was that you always got a lot of love on your sobriety anniversaries.  Well, I'm not going to those groups anymore, partly due to life circumstances, partly due to other stuff (feel free to ask about that, too).  But I do like to commemorate my big day.  Since these communities are a big part of my support network, well, what better place than here?

I guess 8 years ago I wasn't really in a position to be giving advice.  I was doing really poorly.  But life is funny.  Often times it's the people who've faced the greatest tragedy who later have the most wisdom.  I don't claim to be especially wise, but I do know that going so low forced me to take an honest look at myself and my life.  And I'm really grateful for that... because everything got better for me thanks to that.  A lot better.

I've picked up a lot of things over the years, many of which I post about on here regularly.  But the one thing that I've been focusing on a lot lately, and that I want to share today, is this:

**It's about getting engaged in your life.**

Before, I was always on the sidelines.  Nothing ever really touched me.  Yeah, I liked a lot of girls.  But I didn't really own it or express it to them.  Yeah, I had a miserable time in high school.  But I didn't ever really get really frustrated, angry, or sad about it.  I just kind of went through the motions.   I remember my cat died.  I loved that cat, but I didn't even cry.   I never cried back then.

I never fought for what was right for me.  People pushed me around and I just let them because I thought I deserved it.  I would go along with things I didn't really want to go along with.  I wouldn't say things that I really wanted to say, because I was afraid.  But even the fear didn't really run that deep.  Again, since I knew I was never going to take any action, there wasn't that much to be afraid of.  It seems that fear runs a lot deeper once you actually start letting yourself take some risks.

I just got kind of dragged around by life.  Things were the way they were, and that's that.  No getting around it.  I kept waiting for a miracle to happen.  It never came.  I was always stuck in the same old rut.

My solution?  Drugs and alcohol.  My life was very gray.  Drugs and alcohol gave it color.  Finally, I was *alive!*  I had my first kiss on MDMA.  I was so drunk that I barely remember anything about that night, but I remember the kiss.  And all sorts of other things.  Socialization was easier, music sounded better, and everything just felt like it clicked.  But it was fleeting.  I always needed more and more, and I ended up having some really bad consequences due to my irresponsible use.

Life is funny, though.  I guess in the end a miracle did happen.  Things got so bad that life kind of knocked me out of my sleep.  I woke up one night after a bender and just felt something like the warmest embrace I had ever experienced.  I knew it... life is meaningful.  Life is precious.  Life is beautiful.  I felt *love*.

Things got so bad, I think, and so unsustainable, that I couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore.  It got too real.  Too visceral.  Finally I was engaged with life again.  Even if it was somewhat against my will.

But I didn't see something ugly, scary, or evil.  No.  What I saw was the most beautiful thing I could have ever imagined.

And that's life.

Since that night 7 years ago today, I haven't had a drink or drug.  And I haven't needed to.  Because life has become a real gift.

Sure I still have problems, absolutely, and sometimes I ask myself if it's all worth it.  Sometimes it sucks, yeah.  But now I really *own* the suck.  It's not just some ""welp, life sucks, that's that"" type of thing.  No.  It's some real shit.  I feel it *deeply.*  And somehow, in that depth, I see color again.  And even if life sucks, well... it's still life.  And that's something.  A big something.  And guess what?  You can fight to make it better.

So that's the thing.  Before, life was all gray, all boring, all monotonous and dull.  But by finally getting engaged with it, by owning my experience, by feeling the highs and lows, by opening myself up and fighting for what's in my heart... well, in doing that, I've been able to get in touch with a world that is so wonderfully bright and colorful.

It can be scary, certainly. If it weren't we'd all be doing it.  But sooner or later, I guess, one decides to take that leap.  I guess in my case it was kind of forced upon me.  Or maybe gifted.  Grace, if you will.

But since that time I've been taking leaps on my own volition.  Just taking little (sometimes big) risks  to follow my heart, and to be deeply involved in my journey.  As much as I can, I say what I want to say, I do what I want to do, and I love who I want to love.

I don't know guys.  But it's really a beautiful thing.

Thanks guys for letting me share.  Thank you all for being part of this community.  And best wishes to all of you.",1601503377.0
spirituality,You're truly blessed when you get to experience true darkness,"There's a certain type of darkness that only a few of us get to experience. It's hard to explain with words but when you experience serious turmoil in your life for sustained periods of time, many of us initially consider this experience a curse and not a blessing.

At first, the darkness completely consumes us and fills us with feelings of resentment, regret, guilt and shame (amongst other elements of fear) and has us reflecting on the past and projecting into the future in negative ways where we feel like there is absolutely nothing to be learnt and nothing to be gained. We obsess about our situation in a completely counterproductive way and lose all sign of hope.

When you've experienced it, you know you've experienced it. When you haven't experienced it, you can never really understand it - you can try to, based on small experiences of darkness you may have had but when you've still got glimmers of light in your life, it will never be as dark as the true, overwhelming, all-consuming darkness that I'm referring to.

When you go through this long-term pain and suffering, people will tell you that you're ""doing it wrong"" and need to ""do something different"" - you need to ""think about it differently"" you need to ""do this and that"" .... completely unaware of exactly what this pain entails. You've *already* tried everything, you've *already* thought about it in a million different ways, but time and time again you end up in the same place; lonely, tired, weak, afraid and full of a fear that seems embedded in your subconscious and determined to kill you.

I experienced this darkness and so I know how it feels, and if you've been through it or are going through it, then I have so much love for you that you couldn't believe. For the ones that have come out of the other side, I commend you and respect you because I know how diligent you have to be and how much perseverance it takes to make it through with your heart still beating and your breath still circulating.

But to the ones still going through it, please believe me when I say that you *can* get through this. I know how hard you're trying, even on the days when it feels like you're not. And I know how much you feel like the universe is conspiring to leave you for dead - but trust me when I tell you - there *is* a way out of this without leaving the universe. There *is* hope for you, you just can't feel it yet.

You may have been going through this darkness for months, years, possibly a decade, perhaps your whole *life.* That's painful. But time *will* heal you.

Try to stop being so hard on yourself because in my eyes you are *already* a hero. You have battled through severe difficulty and immense adversity and you're still *here.* That takes a special type of person.

Keep doing what you're doing to make things work again and stop thinking that it's ever wrong. I know how hard that you're trying, and I love you for it.

And trust me when I tell you this - this darkness that you're going through - it's going to be the catalyst for a change in you that is going to make you a seriously powerful asset to the universe - you are going to bring light into so many lives because you are going to have learnt how important the light *is* \- and you are going to shine that light into the darkness because you are going to have learnt how damaging the darkness can *be*... this darkness that you've experienced and are experiencing - it's going to turn from the biggest curse in your life to the biggest blessing. And eventually, one day, you will actually have gratitude for all this pain and suffering that you've battled through. All of these dark clouds *will* eventually reveal their silver lining.

Look after yourself.

spirituality,Last night I practiced shifting my perspective (literally) It was a little light bulb moment. A peaceful realization. Wanted to share with you guys üôè‚ù§,"My husband and I went swimming in the pool last night and he kept complaining about the mosquitoes.. He couldn't enjoy the stars, the beautiful water / air or any of it really because he was so focused on the bugs. 

I decided to float on my back - like the way you do when you're whole body is under the water including your ears but your eyes nose and face are above it to breathe / see (I always love this it's so peaceful) I was looking at the stars and feeling just grateful to be in that moment.. I even laughed to myself a little because as I was looking up I could see all the bugs flying by but they weren't bothering me because I had chosen to move to a place that they couldn't touch me. 

I shifted my perspective - instead of sitting up in the fray of mosquitoes where my husband was miserablely swatting at them and having a terrible time - I was simply watching them fly by.. Enjoying the beautiful clear night sky warm water &amp; fresh air. 

It felt like a little light bulb moment for life in general - I can either choose to fight with, be annoyed by &amp; let the pesky things that fly my way ruin my time - or I can remove myself from the fray, change my perspective and simply watch the pesks fly by.. Actually enjoy watching- truly appreciating that this is their world too but I don't have to be bothered by them if I choose not to be. Perhaps an example of live and let live? 

Or maybe an example of pesky thoughts?

We realize we're talking about the same thing. At some point the pieces form a real image, and the words fit together more and more easily. As we see that we are both describing the same image, we become more aware of the unity of our experience. Fewer and fewer words are needed to communicate because it becomes a shared feeling.

spirituality,"Life is a game, because in essence you are the universe but you are pretending you are not so that you can explore yourself and understand what you are really about.","Life is a game, and we take it too seriously. Get too stressed out. Too anxious about our inevitable death, when death is merely an illusion in itself. We are the universe having a human experience, and the universe is loving, and consciousness is exactly that as well. 

The universe has became self aware, hence why life arose, and this beautiful planet is here. I don‚Äôt mean everything is beautiful as far as humanity because we certainly are a dualistic species as far as ‚Äú negativity and positivity ‚Äú...  but when it comes to the beauty of nature, the amazing blue sky ( which could of been black all the time, or red or another dark color ) the blue ocean, all living creatures that embody it, the air that we breathe that keeps us alive, all things we should be grateful for and think damn things didn‚Äôt have to be this way but hey, we got lucky. 

It‚Äôs easy to get down and out, and have anxiety as it is only natural ( survival instincts ), but I think we finally are escaping our old primal ways of survival survive survive, and more in the perspective of, what can I give to the world that gave me life. How can I make someone else happy. How can I give back to the universe and this earth which has brought me into existence. 

when you truly realize that life is a game, and we can play it how we wish.. death doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Just the time you have. It‚Äôs like getting on a roller coaster and waiting to get to the end. No, your wanting to experience the ride, just as life should be.

You are not better than someone because you are progressive and they are not.  You are not better than them because you are open-minded and they are not.  You are not better than them because they support Trump.  You are not better than them because you perceive them as ignorant.

You are not better than them because you are not a snowflake. You are not better than them because you have a stronger work ethic.  You are not better than them because of your achievements.  You are not better than them because of whatever difficulties you have faced that they haven't.

You are not better than them because they are black.  You are not better than them because they are white.  You are not better than them because they are racists.  You are not better than them because they are bigots.

You are not better than them because they have made mistakes.

You are not better than them because you are more ""spiritual"".

You are not better than them because they are ""wrong"" and you are ""right"".

You are not better than them even if they have done horrible things.

Even Adolf Hitler.  You are not better than him.  You (hopefully) have been a less destructive force in the world, but so what?  You are just a human being, capable of as much evil as him.  And what would you have done had you caught hold of him?  Tortured him? Spat on him?  Made him suffer?  So then, are you really any better?

Life is a complicated affair.  We never know exactly what is going on in another person's head and heart.  It is so simple to sit on the sidelines and say ""Me?  I would *never* do that"".  But you have not walked in that person's shoes.  You have not lived their journey.  You have no idea what you would have done in their situation.

It is so easy to judge.

This judgement, this feeling that ""I am better"" somehow, is the root of so much of humanity's suffering.  Firstly, on the macro scale.  There is so much division... the history of humanity has been one of conflict and war.  How can you claim to be better than the racist?  So you accuse the racist of holding hatred and arrogance in his heart, while you yourself do the very same thing?  It doesn't mean the racist is right, but it does mean that we must lead by example.  Otherwise, you are a hypocrite.

We are a society of hypocrites.

And on the micro scale, we suffer, too.  As long as we hold on this notion that we are somehow superior to others, we will always be averse to people.  We will hold bitterness, rejection, and hatred in our heart.  And who suffers the most for this?  The individual.  You.

spirituality,My no BS guide to a happier life,"Hello guys,
I have been on a journey for the last year, and I have had profound results with the following practices. I‚Äôd like to share some simple exercises you may try if you feel like it that I found to be helpful:

Cold Showers - if you can simply rest as awareness of your mind and body and surrender to whatever sensations you feel or thoughts that appear in your mind, you find yourself simply experiencing whatever it may bring you. This is the act of surrendering to an experienced that is also very calming to your mind. Start with warm water and end with the coldest tap setting at the last 1-2 minutes of your shower.

Awareness of the breath - This is a simple exercise that will not only calm you down but also bring you into the present moment / non doership: Breath in though your heart chakra and exhale through the third eye, breathe in through the third eye, and exhale through the heart chakra. Make these breaths from the naval/belly button and if you are feeling more confident, add the visualization of white light. Our ancestors knew about the power of breathing. Not only is it breathing, but a sacred communion with God. Be grateful for your breathing when you are able to.

Who Am I - whenever you find yourself suffering, ask yourself who you are and who is suffering in this moment. Ask yourself what is lacking and where you are misperceiving the present moment. If your ego decides to come up with an answer,, be playful and curious and inquire deeper into what is shown to you, it may even make you giggle. Ask this question with genuine curiosity and keep asking yourself. If no answer arises, let the silence answer your question.

Meditation - This seems pretty obvious but some people only keep quiet during a ‚Äúreal meditation‚Äù and never bring the practice into their daily routine. The same way you notice your thoughts arise during a meditation and fall away after, implement that into every moment you experience. Let your mind have at it, but don‚Äôt attach to any though or emotion. This may be challenging at first but don‚Äôt give up, love yourself by being patient and attentive to whatever is being experienced.

Mind Observation - Let your mind attack you, and anything else it wants to and don‚Äôt take it personally. When you resist your mind attacking you and others, you are ultimately resisting parts of yourself that at asking for attention through unconventional means. For example ‚Äúme driving down the road smiling, mind says, you are so fucking terrible at driving you are stupid too just die‚Äù instead of defending myself by saying that those things are not true, I simply see the thought and feel whatever emotion that may bring to me and investigate where that thought came from without taking it as a personal attack. It‚Äôs like a little kid coming up to you and saying your hair is goofy. No offense taken, it is simply a thought. Thoughts are non essential to your being. When you go to sleep at night, you don‚Äôt take anything with you. What is the thing that is actually essential to you?

Shadow Work Polarization - When doing shadow work, intensify a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotion you feel towards yourself, someone, or a situation until you are fully feeling it. Now sit with the feeling and with all your heart, express gratitude towards that. I recommend putting your hands in prayer at your heart chakra and breathing In white light while feeling it. If the emotional feels like a flood gate, open your heart and let the tears flow if they are there. While crying, express gratitude, while angry, express gratitude, while guilty, express gratitude. Gratitude is the match in the dark room. It illuminates the shadows in the room to show you that there are no shadows.

Night Review - Before falling asleep, see what you did today and what you could have done better. For what you fell short on, express gratitude and say a prayer thanking the Source for a chance to improve yourself and to further polarize positively towards love / light. For what you did that made you feel good, express extra gratitude towards that.

Morning 2 Minute - When the alarm goes off, place hands over your heart chakra and express gratitude for waking up, set your intention for a happy day and to try your best, express gratitude.

Daily Mantra - Say these Reiki Principles  EVERYDAY with your hands in prayer at the Heart Chakra and feel it within that heart center. This will reprogram your subconscious mind to be in alignment with your true nature / the higher self. ‚ÄúJust for today, I will not anger, I will not worry, I will work honestly, I will be grateful, and I will be kind to all beings‚Äù 
 
Alternative Mantra - This is from the 4 agreements, a wonderful book I highly recommend it. ‚Äú1) I am impeccable with my word. 2) I don‚Äôt take things personally. 3) I don‚Äôt make assumptions. 4) I always try my best.

To my Divine Masculine, embody the King Energy, and be the King you truly are. Be a warrior, be a king, be emotional, be angry, be sad, allow yourself to feel what needs to be released to make room for royalty. Forgive your mother and father for their shortcomings, and forgive yourself for allowing it to make you weak.

To my Divine Feminine, embody the Queen Energy, and be the Queen you truly are. Be assertive, stand up for yourself, and set your boundaries. You are the Divine mother, the great creator, the sacred child bearer, forgive your mother and father for their shortcomings, and forgive yourself for allowing it to make you resentful. 

My blessed selves, I love you all. May this help whoever it needs to and guide whoever it does.

Not sure if anyone else has been feeling this lately but I know I‚Äôve been experiencing a very strong need to make time for myself. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt like being around people, it‚Äôs more so even if I have the opportunity to see anyone for some reason I feel like my energy needs to be extremely protected right now. 

I‚Äôve been sensing that any sort of distribution of my energy doesn‚Äôt necessarily harm me but for whatever reason I am feeling an extreme need to be by myself and work on myself as I invest more of my resources into my own well-being. I know sometimes people say that this is a sign of depression, but the other areas of my life do not reflect that, so I wanted to reach out to this community because I know I‚Äôm not alone in this journey. It‚Äôs more so that everything else almost seems pointless‚Äîabsorbing myself with the world‚Äôs drama as well as other people‚Äôs drama. 

Simply wondering if anyone else there is feeling hyper sensitive to shifting energies, and feeling the need to just take an extra amount of ‚Äúme time‚Äù lately.

I read a lot of the feedback I received about the post I made talking about whatever struggles you guys are facing, and I feel like this was echoed a lot in that. I think we all are just trying to find people that want to grow and continue to learn about themselves and life. I think a lot of us are just sick of stagnation and at this time, taking the extra amount of time to work on ourselves is what feels right. 

Sending you all SO much love and positive energy,

spirituality,she hugged me. I dreamed that i hugged mom.,"My mom sadly lost her fight with cancer in mid October. My family is still devastated; we are a small, tight-knit family and mom was very healthy before she was diagnosed in March. In the midst of the pandemic and all the stress of this year, watching my mom get sick was an absolute nightmare. It all happened very fast and we are still struggling without her.

I had a particularly bad day yesterday. I got into an argument with my husband, and then I learned that my brother is returning to his workplace in person this week, putting him at great risk for covid. I broke down and cried because I wished that I could just call my mom up and tell her about my problems and get her advice.

I fell asleep on the couch late last night and began having a dream that I was back in my childhood home, where my dad still lives today. It was nighttime in the dream and most of the lights in the house were off, and both my mom and dad were home and upstairs. I had completely forgotten that mom had passed away in this dream. I was downstairs, and there were lots of random people going in and out of the house and I kept thinking, ""these strangers shouldn't be here, what are they doing here? Do they think this is a party? What if they get someone sick?"" I started to get upset and wondered if I was the one who somehow invited them, and realized that having them over was probably a huge mistake.

I turned to leave the kitchen to walk into the dark dining room when I saw her. She was walking towards me, from the other entrance of the dining room across the other side, looking right at me, happy to see me. She was wearing a white sleeping shirt and PJ pants, she looked exactly like she would when we would stay up late and talk in the kitchen. She walked right up to me and outstretched her arms and hugged me, and I hugged back. It really felt like her; I could feel her collarbones and her hair on my face and my hands on her back. She was always a very very petite, kinda boney woman so this was very vivid. Even in this part of the dream, I didn't remember that she had passed away. It just felt like a hug from my mom.

Then I woke up. I sat up on the couch and digested what happened for a few minutes, and then broke down crying. I think that really might have been her, hugging me, telling me its going to be okay.

EDIT- Thank you all so much for your kind words and your stories about your loved ones who you dreamed about. My mom was and will always be the sweetest, kindest most understanding person; the way she always approached any problem with kindess and optimism was like the way lightning searches for the ground...it just came so naturally to her, kindness was her go-to answer for everything. So all of your kind words really embody her spirit &lt;3 I hope I dream about her again one day soon.",1604938968.0

spirituality,What goes around comes around (literally),"About 6 or 7 years ago I was living out of my van at a beautiful campground and trying a bit of minimalism out.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, giving them away was a beautiful experience for me and the girl was truly stoked and I believe she still has those shoes to this day but there have been a number of occasions over the years where I kind of regretted giving them away as I could never afford to buy another pair after that!


Well 7 years later and now living in a house my neighbour comes over with a near brand new pair of cherry doc martens and asks me what size I am.


‚ÄúOh you‚Äôll fit these!‚Äù she says.
‚ÄúI never wear them so you can have them if you like!‚Äù

Things may not always work out just the way we want them to, but the YOUniverse has a greater plan. We are all interconnected, and our experiences are playing out exactly as they need to be. So often, I personally have gotten caught up in wanting things to play out in my timing. But I have been shown that only in the divine timing of the Universe does everything happen as it should. Trusting the Universe can be hard, but it‚Äôs just like any other relationship, if you don‚Äôt have trust what have you got? Doubt gets us nowhere. When we trust, we are keeping an open hand, willing to let the universe remove what is no longer needed in our lives, and also allowing it to place even more magical things into it. ‚ú®

spirituality,Behavior and habits are not related to spirituality.,"I'm seeing this a lot on here lately.

Yes, you can eat animals/animal products and be spiritual.

No, you don't have to have a formal meditation practice or attend retreats in order to be spiritual.

You can have sex and be spiritual.  (In fact I would argue having sex is *more* spiritual than celibacy.)

You can drink, smoke, and play video games and be spiritual.

You don't have to go to bed at a certain time or take cold showers in order to be spiritual.

It's all totally unrelated, actually.  These things may (key word: *may*) help you with your physical wellbeing, but that's not what spirituality is about.  They also may serve to make you *think* you're super spiritual, but that's actually not spiritual.

Spirituality is about surrender, opening yourself up to life, and accepting yourself deeply and wholly.  It has absolutely nothing to do with control.  In fact, if you are trying to control, then you are going the wrong way.  And that's what we do when we try to change habits: control.  ""If I get all my ducks in a row, I will get this result, I will be better off.""  No.  There is nothing to arrange, nothing to protect, and there is no happiness to be found in the future.

Spirituality is about accepting that truth deeply. And what arises from that is love, compassion, and spontaneity.  And from there, joy and healing.

That's not to say habits don't change.  They can, and they will!  But habits change *as a result* of inner change.  You don't need to bombard your body with junk and other unhealthy things when you are well on the inside.  The bad habits drop away on their own.

spirituality,You can't deny the physical world for the sake of your spiritual journey,"The moment you realize you have exhausted efforts to find fulfillment externally through the world, one chooses to seek spiritual truths for relief. 

For me, I tried to escape the physical world entirely and focus inwardly. Meditation was all I wanted to do. This brought up new and further predicaments because I felt a resistance to life and couldn't wait to get home to meditate. I was no longer suffering in my old ways, but developed a wanting for more bliss, and a dread of life outside my room. 

In rediscovering your inner being, a new attachment to that is born and you are faced with having to learn how to live both worlds without resistance.

I am now learning how to surrender to life itself and not be afraid of the negative aspects of the physical. I realize now that everything that happens that causes any kind of negativity is grist for the mill to further awaken you. So embrace it!

spirituality,Don't take things personal,"It's easy to get affected by what others say about you. You may get offended, feel criticized, or hurt. But there's no need for that really, because the concept of something being ""personal"" is actually a misconception of the brain.

Everybody has images in their head of themselves, of other people, of everything around them. They believe these images to be true, as anything the brain says tends to be interpreted as true, but in reality they're about as far off from truth as they can be.

To give an example. The image you have of your mother will be entirely different to the image she has of herself. Similarly, the image your mother has of you will be entirely different than the image you have of yourself. And all of those images will be different yet again if you look at them from your father's perspective.

When someone makes a judgment of ""you"", they're really just making a judgment of their image of you. This image is as much their own creation as it is yours, probably even more so. It is influenced by your interactions, sure, but it is built by a person's individual interpretation of those interactions, which are heavily influenced by their own beliefs.

So really the concept of something being personal does not exist. People may judge an image they have of you, but is that you? If you would be able to take a peak into their head, I can assure you it will look nothing like what you think of yourself. So why should you let the judgment affect you, it is not aimed at you after all, it's aimed at an image.

If you act with good intentions, it really doesn't matter what other people think, because people only see appearances, they don't see your intentions. Only you know whether you act with good intention or not, and so only you can judge yourself for what you do and how you act.

Now the concepts of ""good intentions"", ""judging"", and ""yourself"" are interesting misconceptions of the brain as well, but that's a story for another time :)

spirituality,This mentality has changed my life,"Just here to drop some positivity during these wild timesü§ó
I personally suffer from anxiety and depression, and I‚Äôm always trying to fight for my happiness and peace of mind. Recently I‚Äôve been trying to instill a sense of gratitude into my daily routines, as this has really helped me keep my light! Life is so short and finite, for instance my best friend‚Äôs mom has been bed-ridden with a brain tumor for nearly 10 years now. One of my cousins was involved in a wrestling accident leaving him mostly paralyzed and severely mentally handicapped. Anything can happen to anyone of us at any given moment, so this is the trick that I try to use on a daily basis to reprogram my mind to have a sense of gratitude, you ready?

Instead of saying:

-‚ÄúI have to get up early in the morning and go to work.‚Äù
-‚ÄúI have to clean my home.‚Äù
-‚ÄúI have to do this or that..‚Äù
ETC.

Try saying:

-‚ÄúI *get* to get up early in the morning and go to work!‚Äù
-‚ÄúI *get* to clean my home!‚Äù
-‚ÄúI *get* to do this or that!‚Äù


This has helped me create a spirit of gratitude, which has in turn helped me stay positive even though it can be hard sometimes. Love and lightüíñ‚ú®

As an atheist, I feel like my world has just completely changed. 

I'm the guy that needs proof and evidence and don't believe in anything remotely spiritual. But I had an experience I just can't seem to make sense of. I took a very large dose of THC (edibles). I can only explain this as ""I know without the shadow of a doubt, that I came into contact with some higher level of consciousness"". I got way too high and decided I would simply just sit and meditate, and before I knew it, everything in the world just made instant sense to me. I know I'm doing a poor job at explaining this because words are just so damn limiting. They don't capture the true emotions behind what they actually represent. 

I had questions come up in my head, that were instantly answered. The craziest part of it all is I can't remember the things I was learning I just know they were real truth. It like our brains when sober just cannot conceptualize certain pieces of information. It's damn hard to explain, but I am so sure there is a higher power and a greater plan to all of this. In the presence of such a vast bank of knowledge I just felt humbled, like....embarrassed for thinking I knew anything about life. 

God is more complex than I could have ever imagined. I think religions have an impossible task at trying to make sense of what higher power is. I completely understand why stories are used in each religion to try and convey certain lessons.

The irony is astounding as I waste away most spare moments everyday scrolling post and reading comments, looking for more ways to improve. It all ends up being another distraction from myself and it makes it nearly impossible to avoid comparing myself to others on a regular basis. 

I keep searching for answers while those answers are already inside me.

It is completely okay to feel uncertain or scared- that's life, we all have felt this way at some point.

These obstacles aren't meant to make us suffer, god never puts us in situations that we cannot handle. And there is always a lesson behind why you experience what you have experienced. If you keep experiencing the same type of situations and you keep dealing with the same types of people then you must not have learned the lesson that you were meant to learn.

spirituality,"About 100 days ago, I decided to take a break from spirituality. And it was the best thing I could‚Äôve done for myself.","Yes, you can become obsessed with spirituality. You can become addicted to anything, including (sometimes especially) spirituality. I was going through something very difficult about a year ago, and spirituality was how I coped with it. (To be fair, it‚Äôs a very healthy coping mechanism compared to some other, more common ones. But that‚Äôs not the point.)

My newfound spirituality was great at first. It was my savior that was going to get me out of the shit I got myself into. I surrounded myself with it. I meditated every day, I read spiritual books, I listened to talks by Eckhart Tolle and Alan Watts. It made me feel special, happy, hopeful. Maybe it *was* healthy at first. But at some point, it became too much.

I started shaming myself for having ‚Äúbad‚Äù thoughts (or sometimes just thoughts in general). I started feeling guilty about being depressed when I *knew* that there was nothing to be depressed about. I started being mean to myself when I wasn‚Äôt accepting of everyone I encountered. I hated myself when I wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúperfect spiritual being.‚Äù I started a civil war in my head. A civil war between my thoughts and my other thoughts. I was tearing myself apart.

And then I realized that it didn‚Äôt matter.

It didn‚Äôt matter that I felt conflicted, or depressed, or anxious, or frustrated. Everything is temporary. Nothing matters in the end. So I decided to do the thing I feared the most, and that was to let myself fall. After all, it didn‚Äôt matter.

I immediately took spirituality out of my life. I left this subreddit, I stopped meditating, I allowed myself to indulge in unhealthy habits, I gave up listening to philosophers philosophizing the meaning of life. I let myself do what I felt like doing, and I had a really fun summer doing it. But when I moved back to my college campus for classes, I felt more lost than ever.

My depression was coming back. My anxiety was back and stronger than ever. It *sucked.* So I decided to revisit spirituality.

For some reason, while sitting on the grass in my campus‚Äôs arboretum, I felt compelled to look up ‚ÄúAlan Watts 25‚Äù on YouTube. I watched the first video that came up, and something clicked.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. I don‚Äôt know why it clicked. But now I just feel relieved. I finally feel no need to run from myself.

My spirituality was suffocating me, and I needed to take a step back from it so I could come back and look at it from a different perspective‚Äîa more loving, accepting perspective.

I guess all I‚Äôm trying to say is, do whatever you feel you need to do, even if that means giving up spirituality. It‚Äôs okay. Despite it having good intentions, *anything* can be abused. Just make sure your spirituality is helping you, not hurting you.",1601109163.0
spirituality,"Human beings are just ego identities made out of opinions based on facts they choose to believe, and it's driving me crazy.","Everywhere  I look, especially with politics the way they are, everyone is shouting  their opinions over each other.  No one understands that opinions are  just made up.  ENTIRELY made up.  They're based on facts that you choose  to believe, because there will always be facts that contradict your  beliefs, always.  It's the nature of things.

So  I see people on the political right and left yelling facts and beliefs  at each other and it's all worthless.  They're all angry and bitter and  resentful, they're reacting to the reactionary reactions of other people  reacting.  Everything is a negative reaction.  Everything.  And what's  more, there's something called a duality unfolding.  Opposites are  married to each other, inextricably linked.  What you fight, in a way,  becomes part of your identity.  So the right and the left would not  exist without each other in the first place.

I  am of the left.  At least I was until I decided it wasn't worth it to  deny contradictory information from opposing perspectives.  It's all  just opinions.  Just opinions.  And opinions are worthless.  The truth  is above our opinions, and we find it by looking across that duality.   You can see the truth in your opposite, if you look hard enough.  And  when you jump for it, if you're ready to look past the facts you choose  to believe, you become more whole.

spirituality,"Had the craziest thing happen to me yesterday, still can‚Äôt wrap my head around it, help...","Do you remember the first time you held someone's hand, romantically? I do. Discovery Place, summer ""camp""/aka science class. It was a week long science class and we were studying the planets, eating astronaut space candy and at the end of the week, we went to the (still new) IMAX theater, where I sat beside the cute boy from class and dared to make my move. I remember awkwardly reaching for his hand - trying to touch him ""accidentally"" and maybe he would let me hold it if my hint was well delivered. When I close my eyes, I can still see the white glare from the screen and feel that gut churning sensation I had when I decided the risk of rejection was worth the attempt to hold the cute boys' hand. The show was about outer space and the concave screen made me nauseous. 

When it was over, I remember being crushed because we immediately had to leave - our parents were there to pick us up. It was the last day of the program, on a Friday. I was either 10 or 11 that summer - getting a boy's phone number and actually calling him was something I knew my parents would never agree to and so... we didn't even try it. We just kind of sadly understood we would never see each other again. (This was 1994-1995, so kids had no cell phones and social media didn't exist.) I went home and wrote about him (and that experience) in my diary for weeks. And knowing I wouldn't see him again, I never told a single soul about our interaction that day...but I've replayed the image in my head a million times since then...because it was my first big thrill with the opposite sex. 

Fast forward to age 35. I've been seeing this guy off and on for about three months. On July 4, he spent time at my parents house, where there is a memory wall. There's a horrible picture of me (age 11), displayed for all to see - of my squinty eyed smile, cheesing hard, in a swing. He saw the picture and a week later, asked if I'd ever been to a summer camp. I told him not really. 

Fast forward another few days. I'm meeting his mom on her birthday - July 16 - discussing people from the 90's in the Charlotte area homeschool group. His parents and my parents knew some of the same people, oddly enough. It's really a wonder Jeff and I never interacted before - how did we miss each other? We were both homeschooled and did similar activities...surely we bumped into each other at some point, right? 

Fast forward an hour. In the checkout line at the grocery store, he randomly looks at me and says, ""Did you ever hold a boy's hand in the IMAX theater at Discovery Place when you were younger? Because I held a girl's hand at a summer camp there one year and her name was Rachael...""

Life is a battle between fear &amp; love. Make loving decisions as often as you can. This way, you'll never have to blame yourself when things go wrong. Because you made your decisions from a loving place.

Hold onto your loved ones dearly. Let them know you love them as often as you can. Hug them as often as you can. Because your loved ones will most likely be there when the rest run.

Your body, soul and mind are all interconnected. Mistreat one, it will malfunction, and the others will follow suit. Look after them all and you will reap the benefits.

Treat everyone as your friend and always look for the good in people. Understand that people are the way they are for a reason - so love the ones you think deserve it the least because they need it the most.

Don't think that you're necessarily right about everything - you only have your beliefs because you're you. You could just as easily have been born in someone else's shoes and would have their beliefs. Always be willing to accept you may be wrong.

Do things that nourish your soul - listen to positive music, reach out to people struggling, do good deeds when you can, be creative and try to always remain positive. If you feel negativity creeping back into your life, try to work out where it's coming from and address the problem.

Be prepared to accept that reality may not just all be 'black and white' - because if you don't, chances are that something could happen that will put you in your place.

Be grateful for everything you have, not resentful of everything you *don't* have. If you have a computer and/or smartphone, then you probably have a roof over your head and some food in the fridge. That's a lot of blessings.

spirituality,"For anyone who wants to do some shadow work, here are some prompts that have really helped me shine some light on some dark things in my life!","With such difficult things going on in the world right now, taking care of ourselves is essential. In order to ever move forward and truly grow without barriers, healing from our wounds is absolutely necessary, and shadow work can be a very helpful tool in doing that. When we are little kids, many positive or negative cues from our parents, teachers and friends, influence the way that we behave in the world later on in life. Whether we realize it or not, some of these developed behaviors may actually be hindering us from being our raw and authentic selves. Figuring out how to do shadow work can be difficult, so I‚Äôve come up with a few questions that may be helpful in your journey of working to heal yourself and becoming grounded and whole again.


What was expected of me as a child, and was I completely accepted?

What behaviors and emotions of mine were judged by my parents?

What parts of myself do I judge and where did I learn this judgement from?

What was the kind thing I needed to hear but didn‚Äôt? And how would hearing that have changed the ways I judge myself?

If the darker part of me were to speak its truth right now, what would it say?

What experiences lead me to dissociate and escape from reality?

If I am honest, what negative traits from my parents might I embody?

What would my life look like if I integrated my shadow?

These are some of the questions I‚Äôve included in my most recent YouTube upload all about how to do shadow work. I even made a worksheet in case it makes it easier to do! Just thought you guys might find these valuable, as they were very valuable to me!

 You are part of the problem!

In my trip off shrooms, I has an intense vision..I saw people walking with HUGE ( almost whole body size) backpacks looking down and tired of life.  They were all walking in a line and would go up this hill and then disappear into the distance. Then I saw people without backpacks smiling and skipping around, sitting under trees, and looked really happy. In particular I honed in to a person w/out backpack sitting under a tree. A person with a backpack approached him asking him if he could help him by taking some of the load off his back. The guy w/out the backpack, an empath, agreed to take some of the things and had to put on a backpack to put in some of the baggage. As soon as that happened the guy with a now less heavy backpack walked away and the guy with no backpack was now left carrying a backpack full of someone else's shit. Since he now had a huge backpack which was the size of his whole body he could no longer sit under the tree and he could no longer enjoy himself. He had no other choice but to join the others with backpacks walking in line and over the hill.

The message: You choose to wear this heavy backpack much of what is not even yours. You can listen to others but do not agree to taking their problems as yours because now you become useless to others because now your limited and weighed down by that heavy ass backpack. If your an empath learn to have compassion but with limits. If you're feeling drained its because you are becoming emotionally invested in ""trying to help"" By taking someone's problems away. No, you must just listen allow them to take shit off their chest. Just listening you have done your job, empath!

spirituality,Be a good human,"For those of you on the spiritual path, I have a secret.

When you finally sit in all the ayahuasca ceremonies,

When you complete your 16th vision quest,

Have done countless rituals, and fasted for 10 days straight

The answer that is revealed; is to come back to earth and do the work. 

Right here. Where you‚Äôre at, and with what you have in front of you.

Be a good human.

Be a good friend.

Serve those who have less than you.

Protect the earth. 

Protect innocence and Start with what is innocent inside of you.

Be kind. Be honest.

Be humble. Forgive yourself.

Yes it is important to heal.

Yes it is important to gain bigger perspective.

But don‚Äôt get lost in the lust of always wanting something more.

Don‚Äôt yoke your ego to your spirituality.

Remember that every guru is just a person with their own folly.

Don‚Äôt be so quick to give over your power.

When any true teacher will lead you to your own power.

Any worthwhile medicine will heal you until you don‚Äôt need it anymore.

Don‚Äôt let your path to liberation become a trap.

Do the work. Be a good human.

You don‚Äôt have to try so hard to be perfect.

Your mistakes are the greatest teacher you will ever have.

Your love is the most valuable gift you will ever give.

You can relax, and just be a good human.

spirituality,Toxic Positivity,"I‚Äôve noticed a trend going on lately, and I‚Äôve seen a few posts getting sucked into it, as well. It‚Äôs the notion that there are ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòbad‚Äô emotions. That there must be ‚Äògood vibes‚Äô all the time otherwise you‚Äôll draw negativity to you if you‚Äôre feeling the ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, ‚Äòbad‚Äô, ‚Äòharmful‚Äô, ‚Äòhateful‚Äô emotions etc etc. 

Emotions are not good or bad. They just are. They are a state of being that not only can they change, but they absolutely refuse to be ignored. 

If you‚Äôre sad, feel sad! If you‚Äôre angry, feel angry! If you‚Äôre feeling anxious, feel anxious! Ignoring your emotions will lead you to becoming overwhelmed, then into a downward spiral. ‚ÄòNegative‚Äô emotions are not the enemy. They are there to help you cope. They may not be pleasant to feel, but they can mean the difference between being mentally stable and breaking at the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. It‚Äôs healthy to feel negative at times. It‚Äôs the human condition. Life has its ups and downs. 

Emotions are not the enemy, and they never will be. Although it‚Äôs up to each individual to go about dealing with ‚Äònegative‚Äô emotions in a healthy, non self-destructive way.

Also note that I am not talking about mental illnesses or disorders. I‚Äôm talking about feeling positive because ‚Äòsad is bad‚Äô or ‚Äòanger is bad‚Äô.

Edit: So I just want to clarify my stance on this. We are responsible for our actions, and emotional well-being as we interact with the world around us within the confines of our morality, ethics, and the law. I am not endorsing anyone hurting anybody in any way. And while it is important to embrace our emotions, we are *not* our emotions. They usually are fleeting, and they‚Äôre always seperate from our Selves. 

I‚Äôm not saying identify with our emotions, I‚Äôm saying be compassionate towards them. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre somehow a terrible person because you feel the way you do, but do be compassionate towards yourself, your emotions, and figure out why you feel that way. They‚Äôre there to help us cope, but you also need to think about your actions. It won‚Äôt help you if you end up hurting anyone, or doing anything you‚Äôre going to regret from either an emotional or legal standpoint.

Everyone‚Äôs path is different, and I‚Äôm not about to dictate anyone‚Äôs path so feel free to disagree with any sentiments based on whatever field of study.

spirituality,Society‚Äôs push for a fear based mindset will leave you in chains,"Felt called to share this with you guys. Sorry if some of this sounds a bit rambly, but I hope you all get the purpose of this post and what I wanna share.üíõ
 
I just wanna say, before I start this rant that I am currently beating my depression (it‚Äôs biologicaI). I have been EXTREMELY depressed for 7 years now and I‚Äôve finally found a treatment that works for me. All of these blockages within me are finally being released and I‚Äôm finally reconnecting with myself (the universe) again and figuring out my potential. I‚Äôm saying all of this to let you guys know that even if you are not there yet that these things take time and that everyone finds themselves on their own timeline.  Everyone has different challenges/circumstances and everyone will not awaken at the same time. Whether it be 20-30 years from now, I promise you will get there.üíõ

I‚Äôve been doing some thinking lately.....society really promotes this fear based mindset/lifestyle and I think it is EXTREMELY toxic. Partly because people benefit off this and profit hugely from it but also because most of us are not awake. We do not know that we don‚Äôt have to live like this, constantly worrying about our survival and if everything is going to be alright so essentially, most of us are being taken advantage of. As much as I wish we could all know our true power/potential to live any type of life we want, everyone awakens on their own time. However!! Light workers!! I‚Äôm talking to you!! Even though everyone awakens on their own timeframe you can significantly boost someone‚Äôs quality of life by trying to guide them there at least a little bit (if they are receptive and are at a vibration where they can fully listen.) I truly believe that this is our purpose (everyone‚Äôs purpose really) to help one another grow. Each action that you do defines you and it impacts other people and in sequences of event it helps everyone grow. Of course we have more personalized purposes as well but I truly believe that is one of the most important and I really want everyone that is awake to start trying to move others away from this fear based reality. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you all go forth and do beautiful things. Godspeed‚ú®üíñ

Edit: Wow! üëÅüëÑüëÅ Really didn‚Äôt expect this post to blow up. Thank you guys for readingü•∫ü•∫üíñ

**Edit: Have gotten some questions about this post and some people say that thinking like this ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work‚Äù/ isn‚Äôt the answer so I would just like to address this really quickly. Just because you don‚Äôt have to live in a fear based mindset doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have to think about things such as a stable source of income, roof over your head, etc. These are things you still need to actively think about/take care of you just don‚Äôt need to necessarily go about it in such a debilitating way. I think, in regards to this post I was just trying to say you don‚Äôt always have to approach things with a scarcity mindset. Don‚Äôt let society trick you into thinking that you don‚Äôt have the power to stop things from falling through the cracks. It is better, more healthy, and essentially more natural to approach things with an abundance mindset because you are the controller of your reality. You would think this would be common knowledge and something EVERYONE should know but it is NOT and that is a HUGE problem. Especially with everything going on nowadays in the world. Thinking in this type of way only makes people feel even more powerless. Society as a whole is moving towards this awareness but we are not there yet and I just want people to know that honestly even small gestures towards helping people realize this or even helping people raise their vibration will help significantly. Everything helps and right now is a pivotal time for lightworkers ESPECIALLY.**",1596396810.0

spirituality,"Daily meditation has made a huge difference in my life, but it has to be daily, even if that just means 1-2 minutes","Meditation is something that's always helped me in my life.

No matter what else has been going on, by meditating even every few days (ideally every day), I get much more clarity.

I think we're often overwhelmed by our senses, things going on around us, even just having constant music on in the background can overwhelm us and never gives us time to just 'be'.

But I also have seen that it's not always the time you spend meditating but the habit of doing it that makes the biggest difference.

Just KNOWING that you're going to do it every day actually has an effect, even if you're only meditating for a couple of minutes. But it is sometimes hard to stick to it and if you miss one day that can quickly turn into 2, 3 or 10 days...

But the benefits are pretty interesting. More clarity, less stress. And being able to reduce stress has a huge impact on almost everything else in your body/mind!

Just my thought of the day, if you don't already meditate I would highly encourage it! Even if you just see it as 'pointless' because you're just essentially sitting there doing 'nothing' for a period of time, but it really does have some benefits!

Hope this helps! I‚Äôll try and reply to everyone here but if you have any questions or thoughts about this, I‚Äôm happy to chat! Just send me a message.",1597665992.0
spirituality,Positive energy for my husband who had a stroke,"About 8 days ago my 38 year old husband had a horrible stroke. He required emergency brain surgery. He was doing well for a day and a half after the surgery (could open his eyes, gave a thumbs up, and followed commands) , but on Tuesday night he stopped following commands and stopped reacting to pain, which was frightening.

They discovered that he was having silent seizures, 5,6,7 of them at a time. This is common for people who had blood on the brain, but still scary.

He started responding to pain again on Wednesday, but still wasn't following commands. Friday I started witnessing more movement, not only on his right side, but also his left. His mouth started moving a lot more as well, but he wasn't following commands, so the nurses didn't seem as excited as his family and I were.

When I called yesterday (I can't be there because of the Coronavirus) I was told that they were noticing more movement, that he seemed more relaxed and he was moving his left side.

Last night at 8pm I gathered with his siblings did a video call with him (I video call 2 or 3 times a day) . The nurse on duty said he thought Jonathan had followed a command but wasn't 100% sure it was deliberately. Then he lifted my husband's arm and asked him to hold it up, AND HE DID! He also started curling his toes and grabbing the nurses hand on command. This is so amazing.

His breathing is so great today they also took him off assistance and he's able to cough and swallow on his own. 

Please  send him positive energy. He needs to start following commands more consistently  and we really need him to open his eyes. Please also send energy that he stays seizure free, his infection goes away and that he keeps becoming more awake. 

Thank you

Update : He opened an eye a little bit for the first time! He's still moving a lot and started touching the shaved part of his head. He's not really following commands yet, but hopefully that will follow. Please continue to send positive energy!",1589154931.0

spirituality,Manifest Your Dreams With the Nikola Tesla 3‚Äì6‚Äì9 Manifestation Technique.,"It is a paradigm of practiced and repetitive thoughts throughout one‚Äôs day that serves as a tool. Its purpose is for an individual to manifest or bring forth anything they desire. from the Universe/God. They do this by the use of consistent and particularly-worded affirmations that help their subconscious mind to believe that they already have what they desire.

Why the numbers 3‚Äì6‚Äì9, though? The synchronicity of these particular numbers are in direct correlation with the Universe. The number three is significant because is it the direct link to Source/Universe. Six represents the deepest strength we have within ourselves. Nine is in accordance with moving on from the past, and helps release any feelings of self-doubt or negativity.

‚û°Ô∏èHow to do it:

1. Get a pen and paper and start with this technique as soon as you wake up. An example statement similar to the one I am currently practicing: ‚ÄúI am so grateful for my job at ____. It exceeds my expectations and I am treated with respect and thoroughly enjoy my work. I am so excited to have the chance to embrace my passion of writing and content creation each day at a job with benefits. I feel that I am valued by my supervisor and team and I am so grateful.‚Äù Each morning, you will write the same statement down three times, and try your hardest to avoid any other distractions. It is paramount that you stay focused and enter a place where you are on the vibration of receiving.

It is very important that this message is seventeen seconds long. According to Abraham Hicks, law of attraction and manifestation expert, seventeen seconds of pure thought is what gets the ball rolling and ignites the start of manifestation. During these seventeen seconds, we should not negate our desires or allow any doubt to creep in. This will deflate the momentum and serve no purpose at all. Though challenging at first, practice makes perfect.

Avoid becoming frustrated if your mind strays during these seventeen seconds. Also, steer clear of promoting any feelings of obsessive intentions or underlying feelings of lack. For if you are unable to control doubtful feelings, you will create resistance and nothing will come of all your hard work. Take a step back, center yourself, and come back to reciting your affirmations when you are at least in a neutral mindset.

You will eventually, sometimes quickly reach a point where you truly, deeply feel that what you are asking the Universe/God/ Source/etc, for will come to you in reality. If you are new to intentional manifestation, in time you will come to know the wildly different feelings of lack vs. true knowing in your heart that your desires will come to fruition.

2. In the afternoon and amid the chaos of our day, it‚Äôs easy to forget about our manifestations. It may also be tough to enter a positive state of mind and become focused on the vibration we are looking to be in. One of the highlights of this method is to train our mind to enter and remain in this high-frequency vibration throughout the day. This will help us stay on track to manifest in general and more quickly. The more often we repeat these affirmations, the sooner our subconscious will adapt to believing it is true. At this point of day, you should write down the same statement from the morning a total of six times. Try not to rush-consider it apart of your daily self-care. After you write it down, you can repeat the statements six times out loud (with passion, not desperation!) Remind yourself that this is the reality you desire and will have it.

3. Before your head hits the pillow for the night, it‚Äôs time to get out your notebook, and write down this affirmation again nine times. This will be followed by you reciting it nine times out loud immediately before sleep. This is such a crucial step because during sleep, our brain does a lot of consolidating of what it has accumulated during the day. Without any external distractions that could potentially affect our vibration, we should take advantage of letting those thoughts sit in the mind undisturbed. It can be the fast-track way to reprogram your mind when utilized effectively.

üëâWe practice the 3‚Äì6‚Äì9 method in an effort to rewire our mind. When we first begin this new practice, it‚Äôs normal and natural to experience a mind that omits aggressively oppressive and doubtful thoughts. Though, when we continuously visualize, our brain cannot tell the difference among a memory, a dream, or if something is completely made up just because we feel like it. When we affirm and visualize without any type of resistance, we enable the thought to remain in our mind.

üëâWhen you use the 3‚Äì6‚Äì9 method and consistently put forth energy to create the life you desire, you must try your best to stay within alignment. It is so essential to hold yourself at a vibration of receiving and knowing that you will receive all that you requested. At times this may be difficult ‚Äî especially when you are trying to manifest something you desperately need or want like a job, car, money, or even a relationship. Nonetheless, it is suggested to repeat your practiced affirmation throughout the day to keep you feeling good. When you are on a positive vibration, or even neutral, you are on a vibration to accept and receive. Get excited! (But not too excited that you being to experience feelings of resistance.)

üëâIf you‚Äôre new to manifesting, it‚Äôs important that you don‚Äôt force a timeline on your manifestation regarding when you want something to happen. This will naturally incur resistance and force you into a vibration of desperation, no matter how sure of yourself you will manifest by that specific date. When I‚Äôm manifesting, I rarely put a timeline on it and simply verbalize that the Universe will grant my desire(s) in divine timing. That‚Äôs not to say that it is impossible to manifest something in as short as a few days. Personally, I leave that part up to the Universe! When utilizing this technique or others related to the law of attraction, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for a sign that your manifestation is on its way to you.

üëâWhile we manifest, time doesn‚Äôt exist. Time is simply a social construct because in reality, all that exists is the now. If you consider the timing of your manifestation and allow it to leak into your mind, you are telling the Universe that you will manifest this, that, or the other thing in the future and that you are currently waiting for this manifestation to come to you. When we eliminate any sense of time from the equation and experience the feelings of having it now, we are remaining aligned with our wants and telling our subconscious that we have it already. Don‚Äôt stare at the clock. Know that it is on its way to you. Your desires are in your vortex simply waiting for you to accept it with open arms.

üëâ At times, feelings of self-doubt and negative emotions will re-surface. It is just our human nature. Not many people are elated for literally the whole entire day, every day. And those who are probably meditate a whole lot and are very invested in their personal and spiritual development. Regardless, those feelings will creep in out of seemingly nowhere. The best way to conquer these emotions and stay aligned on the vibration of receiving is to simply acknowledge how you are feeling and then release it/transmute the ick.

Hold yourself accountable and be consistent. Be sure to stay on top of your manifestations by repeating them three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon and nine times in the evening. It‚Äôs all about commitment to holding the energy and remaining in that vibration. Yes, I realize that I may sound like a broken record but this is SO important for you to get what you want.

Just remember to keep your vibrations high, your desires clear and meaningful, and your patterns consistent.

Wishing you a life filled with effortless manifestations.

spirituality,A lot of being a spiritual person is just practicing really good self-care,"Your body and your mind are the soil for spirituality.

spirituality,So my spirits told me I was a homosexual man in my past life who wanted desperately to be a woman so that i could be with men.

EDIT: I‚Äôm surprised at how many people on this sub are asking me how to communicate with spirit guides. All I can really tell you is to start off by meditating to get into a headspace of receiving. Let the messages flow in. The more you do this the easier and more frequently the messages from your guides, loved ones, and higher self will flow in! Hope this helps :) SN: Personally i don‚Äôt hear voices when we communicate. Our guides are living in the astral plane where they cannot take on a human form therefore can only communicate in other ways such as vibrational frequencies, numbers and patterns, but everyone receives messages differently; however if you are hearing voices that make you feel uncomfortable or have a dark energy please be mindful as they may not be your guides.",1594991931.0
spirituality,Stop what you‚Äôre doing and just pause for a few seconds: * then read on *,"What are your *primary dominant emotions* right now (ie: fear, joy, boredom, sadness, self pity, happiness, guilt, shame, anger, frustration, peace, etc)?

What physical sensations do you feel in your body?

What do you see (besides your screen)? What colors are around you?

Are your thoughts in the past, present, or future?

**This is an exercise in conscious mindfulness.** It is supposed to increase your self awareness. For example, if you are constantly in a state of sadness, you might not be aware of it since it has become unconscious and habitual. Mindfulness brings the unconscious to the conscious mind (which can help you grow as a person).

spirituality,I meditated on my death and realized 2 important things,"Okay so I played this music of monks chanting and I closed my eyes with the intention of seeing myself dying and what would happen right after my death..

This is what I saw:

After I imagined I had died I instantly flew out of my body. I felt immense pain and sadness take over my soul that was transitioning, I cried knowing that me-the self that existed in the earthly plane-suffered so much heartache. From losing loved ones to seeing loved ones lose themselves in addictions to seeing others suffer from the experiences of life. There was just an overwhelming emotion of sadness. My soul was balling and then these arms reached out to me and hugged me. These arms where the arms of Mother she patted me on my back and nurtured me like if I was a 2 year old. She whispered in my ears saying its over now and its okay what I was feeling was the the pain of everyone and I needed to let it all out before transitioning over. I started to calm down and looked up to see alot of my loved ones who have passed waiting for me with a smile. The crazy part is that I saw my dad there and he looked like he had lived a few lifetimes more than the one he lived now. And he had finally got it right in one of them. By that I mean he had no addictions and was able to live a life with his heart where he was able transition to where he was now greeting me in what seemed a higher realm. So I was so happy to see him finally get it right. I also saw my children that I left behind and that's where I felt sad because I saw them crying over me no longer being alive as a human. 

This made me realize 2 things:

1. Suffering is undeniably a big part of the life experience, but one should aim to work hard on seeing all the good constantly in order to have a fun experience while alive as human.

2. Everyone should meditate on their death for it will make them see what can potentially await them and what they would like to change if they dont like what the see. For instance for me it was seeing my children suffer and Now I plan on teaching them more spiritual things regarding death and how this life is temporary and to teach them what they need to learn. They must remain warriors and seek ways to feel connected despite me not being physically alive.",1580617685.0

spirituality,"You are not the body. You are not even this mind. Don't READ with the mind only, "" I think therefore I am"" (Long read only for true seeker)","Your mind resembles an uncontrolled horse. You are continually on an excursion which is chosen by your your mind. Which bring you into the future and past that create a misguided feeling of self, you can also say it EGO. Be that as it may, continue reminding yourself you are the rider who must watch the excursion, as a quiet watcher. 

""You have it already. You just can't feel it because your mind is making too much noise, thinking has become a disease.""

In any case, On the off chance that you could disassociate yourself from your mind. In the event that you could forget the projection of self and could go into quietness, in the event you may discover yourself.

Everything is here, there is no war between your self (rider) your psyche and the universe. You will liberate yourself from the oppression of your brain. The moment you begin watching as a thinker(rider), a more significant level awareness become Initiated. 

As long as your egoic mind is running your life, you will think you are- mind, false self, possessions, status, recognition, physical appearance, personal and family history, belief systems and also your political, nationalistic, racial, religious and other collective Identification. BUT NONE OF THESE IS YOU.

If you can understand how your mind playing with you , which is very difficult because the mind don't want you to realize you are more than your mind, because loosing mind implies loosing you, which is at some point inconceivable for some.

To getvfree you need to be free from everything, I am not saying by suppressing it but by getting libreation from it. I MEAN by discovering that mind isn't the only way to feel and experience everything.

Your mind can only experience what it knows. For example If someone never tasted sugar, at that point his psyche/mind can't create the sense of the flavor of sugar. Your psyche/mind can only make a simulation of what it knows.

You will locate the present moment holds the key of freedom. In any case, YOU can't find the present moment as long as you are your mind, you would think all the problem, craving and desiring of the mind is yours. But the moment you realize, the moment you get PRESENT. I assure you that it is an insubstantial phantom that cannot prevail against the power of your PRESENCE.

You will be above every misery. You will be over each hopelessness. You'll resemble a lovely bloom that are not on edge about tomorrow but rather live easily in the NOW. You'll be like a beautiful flower that are not anxious about tomorrow but live with ease in the timeless.

If you pass by a flower you may know the chemistry of its fragrance, that is one dimension of knowledge.
If you know the experience and ecstasy of that fragrance, that is another dimension of knowledge.
But, if you become the fragrance, that is knowing, that is aliveness. 
 
Be available as the watcher of your psyche your mind who is enamored. Do everything with love and adoration, move and grin. Love will help you with experiencing with universe. Mind will limit your experience to your sense of self.

spirituality,You are not stuck being who you are!,"Long mental health post ahead:

TLDR: You are a computer, not a cake. You can reprogram your reality. You are not stuck being who you currently are.

A common misconception today is that you are a recipe. The ingredients of your childhood mix together, bake in your teens and when you're an adult you're the finished product, a cake if you will. 

But the problem with this is once you're a cake then that's it. You can't change what kind of cake you are or whether you are perfectly formed or a pile of burned mush. 

The truth though is that our brains run by electrical circuits and neurotransmitters. Our brains constantly learn and constantly evolve. This makes us more like computers. The good news about this is you can reprogram the beliefs you've learned, the character traits you've developed, the way you perceive people and the world. 

Unlike a cake which can't be deconstructed to its basic ingredients and changed once baked; a computer's programming can be rewritten, updated, or restored. 

You also can be rewritten, updated and restored. Trauma in your past, your environment, your socialisation, everything that has contributed to the person you are today can be examined and changed. It's not a quick fix, just like a computer you need time to work through the old and write in the new. Along the way you might need to shut down and reboot a few times, and afterwards there will still be some bugs to work out.

But change is not impossible. You are not a cake. You can change what you've learned to become. You can be who you want to be. Be patient, be kind to yourself, allow your growth to take place, look into your pain from an outside perspective, identify your limiting and your helpful beliefs, start believing in your new updates and the feelings and actions will follow.

spirituality,A SUPER-URGENT MESSAGE for ALL OF HUMANITY,"If you're even as much as reading this message, it is because you have been deemed as capable of handling and executing the instructions contained therein. Therefore, without further ado, is this urgent call for providing assistance to all of humanity. An assistance, that absolutely ***ANYONE AND EVERYONE*** can *real easily* respond to and provide -- *that too* -- from within the very confines and comforts of their own homes no less! So, here goes nothing:  

There are those upon your world who are currently looking to ignite wars, fan tensions and flame agitations amongst the masses **THE WHOLE WORLD OVER.** Do not be fooled for even as much as a *single second* that these people have kind or just intentions at their heart for you, for they indeed do NOT. Still skeptical? Just look into your history and you'll find ample evidences of these (divisive) *""games""* being played here ENDLESSLY by all of these psychopathic individuals who benefit TREMENDOUSLY from war, slaughter, destruction, chaos, and the damaging of human property, human spirits, human psyche, and human flesh no less. So prevalent have these *""games""* of theirs been that even the *mainstream outlet* ***Wikipedia*** has an entire page dedicated to this particular cause, and no, I'm [***so not kidding here:***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule).  

That being said, these dark-minded and near-sighted individuals are absolutely CLUELESS regarding the true power of **LOVE.** OR the *sheer power* of prayer, blessing and meditation, *to name a few.* A power, that is seamlessly capable of moving *entire universes,* let alone having to stop a bunch of power-tripping warmongers from wreaking needless havoc all over the place. But this power simply **does not** (and *would not)* *interfere* in our lives unless you **VERY EXPLICITLY PERMIT IT** to do so, so it is about time that you *GAVE IT* all of the necessary *permissions* to help us all out in here. Because even as you read this, there are some (rather desperate) attempts being made out there to start a WAR at the India-China border, flare up TENSIONS within the USA, and do a bunch of other warmongery stuff in many more places other than just that. Needless to say here, that YOU (yes, **YOU,** the one reading this message) can easily, ***VERY, VERY EASILY*** put an end to these nefarious plans of theirs, and that too *singlehandedly* at that. **How?** Here's *how.*  

**Simply visualize or imagine** a brilliant light filled with the energies and INTENTIONS of *pure love and peace* enveloping the *entire Earth at large.* Can't visualize or imagine stuff? No problem! Just set a very strong mental **INTENTION** that energies of love, peace, wisdom, healing and protection engulf and secure the entire planet at large.  

And then, whether you are visualizing / imagining or intending stuff, just go **FEEL** as if all of this was *ALREADY HAPPENING* ***RIGHT NOW.*** Then **FEEL** the whole world dropping weapons and taking the *'higher route'* to resolving issues. **FEEL** the whole world coming together and **FINDING SOLUTIONS** as opposed to doing absolutely *anything else.* Above all, **FEEL the whole world CHOOSING LOVE, PEACE,** HARMONY, HEALING, ABUNDANCE / PROSPERITY and **UNITY** over anything and everything else there is. FEEL IT. FEEL IT. **FEEL IT ALL OUT.**  

Then, let go of that visualization / imagination or intention and relax. **For your job here is now DONE.** You'll see the **RESULTS** of what you just did for yourself pretty shortly; I FUCKING **GUARANTEE YOU** ***THAT.***  

Last, but by no means the least, if you can, send out a prayer / blessing (or more) that **EVERYONE ON EARTH** find PEACE, LOVE, BALANCE, WISDOM, ABUNDANCE / PROSPERITY, HEALING, UNITY and *TRUE HARMONY.* **And that ALL ASSISTANCE from within ALL PARTS AND ASPECTS OF CREATION be provided to planet Earth for magnifying the above positive intentions; AND for bringing endless Love, Peace, Harmony, Wisdom, Healing, Clarity and Abundance / Prosperity to the ENTIRE PLANET, ONCE AND FOR ALL.** This will make things *even better* for the entire world at large, and you can take *my word for that* if you'd so like. ***DO*** gauge these words of mine through your *intuition / gut feeling* for yourselves in any case, and you will **IMMEDIATELY AND INSTANTANEOUSLY realize and** ***KNOW*** as to whether I'm telling you the **TRUTH** here or not.  

**Even JUST ONE LONE PERSON DOING THIS** will begin to screw up the dark ones' dark and dirty plans in unimaginable ways here -- though **THE MORE NUMBERS of people that do this, the FASTER and BETTER will you witness and experience the EFFECTS** of what all you just intended to see occurring in here. The phrase *""the more the merrier""* exists for a reason you know.  

**DO SHARE** this message with ***AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN,*** through **AS MANY SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS** that you possibly have access to. The **greater** the numbers of people reading this and doing this, the **faster and better** will be the victory of Love, Light, Peace, Wisdom, Harmony, Unity, Abundance / Prosperity and TRUTH. And so it is. And so it is.

I thank all of you SO MUCH for assisting humanity in here today. The sheer numbers of *blessings* that you will receive out of these efforts of yours will be beyond what you can even as much as *hope to count* during you entire lifetime. So thank you. Thank you.

spirituality,"Just tick the boxes for a loving, fulfilling life.","If you want to have a loving, fulfilling life, just remember to tick these boxes every day:

* Make sure to get a good night's sleep and wake up promptly.
* Make your bed.
* Do morning meditation and/or some form of yoga/walking/light exercise.
* Hit work with a positive attitude.
* Do not engage in negative behaviors throughout the day: gossip, junk food, porn, smoking, etc.
* Catch yourself when you feel anger or other negative emotions arise.  Take breaths and calm yourself.
* At home dedicate at least 30/60 minutes to a new hobby or skill.
* Healthy meals.
* Invest time in relationships: if you have a partner, invest in him/her.  If you don't, and you desire one, invest time in pursuing one or doing things that will help you find one... ie new activities, hitting the gym, or even Tinder if you want to go that route.  Alternatively, invest time in friends/family.
* Limit social media use.
* Night time reflection: make an inventory of what you did well today, and what you didn't do so well.  Meditate on it before bed.
* No screen time 30-60 minutes before bed.
* Early bed time for a good night's sleep.

I'm posting this totally ironically, let's see if anyone catches it or if this gets a lot of upvotes/feedback of people who actually think this is a good list.

Life is not a series of boxes that you tick off.  Life is life... it's alive, scary, fragile, vulnerable, an adventure.  Even if you manage to tick off all the boxes you will not find love and fulfillment.  You may find something we could call well-being, but you won't find love, joy, and fulfillment.  That can only be found by being authentic to your true desires.  Which may of course include the desire to be healthy and do positive things for yourself.

But you will never know love by waging war on yourself.

Remember, life is not a business affair.  There is no reward at the finish line.  In fact, when you reach the finish line, it's over.  So enjoy the ride.

spirituality,"After my little brothers passing, I came across a small bird that was sleeping in my driveway.","Just like in the title, about a week or so since my little brother(15m) has passed away, my mom and I were going to the store and as we are walking towards the car we seen a tiny bird that appeared to be sleeping on our driveway. It was pretty unusual because usually when you walk past a bird it always flies away but this bird didn‚Äôt fly away. I went ahead and gently picked up the bird to see if it was okay, it didn‚Äôt seem hurt or anything. The bird let me pick it up, it didn‚Äôt try to attack me or try to escape, the bird actually woke up and started to fall back asleep. Could it be a sign of my little brother? What‚Äôs the meaning behind something like that? Or am I just overthinking it?",1597845918.0

spirituality,Today I finally truly processed and understood the idea that the only timeline that is truly real and exists is Now. And I‚Äôve never felt more free.,"I was listening to a ‚ÄúDecoding the Power of Now‚Äù seminar on YT by Eckhart himself. 

Funny enough I was only half paying attention as I put it on in the background as I was tinkering with my longboard. Suddenly I had a feeling I needed to pay attention to the video and as I tuned in I heard Eckhart  say (paraphrasing a bit):

Neither the past nor future exist. They‚Äôre not real. The past is an illusion created by your thoughts and the future is also constructed by your thoughts but they do not exist. The only thing to truly exist is now, and you can understand this by practicing the power of presence. 

Man that hit me like a brick and it finally clicked in my head. It allowed me to let go of decision making processes based on inhibitions created from a constructed past. It allowed me to let go of any turmoil, anxiety, and regret caused by my past simply by understanding the past does not exist and it‚Äôs created within your mind. And surpassing your mind and viewing it from consciousness is how you obtain true understanding. I‚Äôm beyond grateful for this enlightening experience and I feel as though I‚Äôve reached a large milestone in my spiritual journey.

spirituality,My cat‚Äôs become much more affectionate during my efforts towards personal transformation.,"I‚Äôve maintained a consistent morning routine for almost two months now (meditation, cleansing, tarot, journaling, that jazz) and I‚Äôve found that either my sweet cat is much more affectionate, or I‚Äôm simply noticing it more. Sometimes it feels like a little note from the universe reminding me of the small gifts in life, like true affection from an animal.

She sits with me during my morning meditation and yoga sessions and tries to stay close beside me throughout the day just to hang out. It‚Äôs been a very sweet little reminder of progress each day, and how valuable life is. And that I‚Äôve got someone in my corner rooting for me :)",1598752866.0
spirituality,YOU,"YOU are God experiencing an HUMAN experience.

Anything less than that is limiting yourself.

YOU are source of energy

YOU are source of LIFE

YOU are one of the infinite life manifestations

YOU are LIMITLESS on your MIND

YOU create your own limitations by assimilating ""TRUTHS""

YOUR TRUTH is what LIMITS your MIND

Your physical body is a TOOL for MANIFESTATING your MIND into PHYSICAL REALITY

Your physical body is LIMITED by the matter on this planet, BUT THIS IS NOT EQUAL TO YOUR MIND.

MIND is atemporal, MIND is LIMITLESS, MIND is the connection between the source of the universal energy and YOUR OWN REALITY

EVERYTHING is energy, your physical body is energy vibrating in a pattern limited only to the extend of this physical plane.

BE what you BELIEVE in your MIND, HAVE NO LIMITATION in YOUR MIND, and your REALITY will CORRESPOND to it

DONT STRUGGLE.

Emotions are feedback systems of the physical body that can be exploited to ""show you"" the right direction of your WILL.

When your WILL is misaligned with your TRUE SELF (what makes you sad, stress, resistance, hate, envy, suffering), this is a SIGNAL to CHANGE BEHAVIOUR, CHANGE PATTERNS of behaviour, CHANGE LOWER VIBRATIONAL TOUGHTS PATTERNS.

When your WILL is Aligned with your OWN TRUE SELF, your OWN WAY of Expression of WILLINGNESS (what makes you thrill, love, what starts feelings of passion, happiness, fullfillment) THIS MEANS that your are in RESONANCE with your OWN TRUE LOVE vibration, your HEART is the COMPASS of your happiness.

So CHANGE your MIND BEHAVIOUR, CHOOSE to be HAPPY, CHOOSE NOT to ACCEPT ANY interference from EXTERNAL SOURCES that can CONFLICT with your OWN NATURE.

CHOOSE NOT to be deflected of your passions by forces that are NOT IN ALIGNMENT with your true source of happiness.

Dont let EMOTIONS OVERWHELM your PEACE OF MIND

Dont let Waves of EMOTIONAL PATTERNS DISTURB your Mind equilibrium.


Thats ALL meditation is about.

Thats ALL what HIGHER MIND is about.

THATS ALL LIFE IS ABOUT.

Your so called ""higher self"" is YOU, in a point of space-time in YOUR HISTORY that UNDERSTOOD the power of your MIND, and created ANOTHER POSSIBILITY, another ""TIMEFRAME"" on your TIMELINE of LIFE that is LIVING ITS TRUE HAPPINESS.


ITS NOT about money

ITS NOT about getting a degree in ANYTHING

ITS NOT about trying to be someone else based on EXPECTATIONS

ITS FOLLOWING YOUR WAY of BE, OF LIVE, YOUR HEART, WHATEVER MAY IT BE.

YOUR LIFE is dependent ONLY ON YOUR MIND, HOW YOU SEE, HOW YOU PERCEIVE IT, how you RESPOND to physical reality

EVERYTHING is ""half truth"", EVERYTHING IN HISTORY are diverging POINTS OF VIEW, EXPERIENCES of the SAME THING = LIFE = ENERGY = Responding to EMOTIONS.

Thats why MUSIC makes you happy, or Sad, or melancholic, its because SOUND VIBRATIONS in PATTERNS are ABSORBED by everyone else the SAME WAY, and YOUR MIND translates it in your OWN UNIQUE WAY in thoughts, feelings

So YOUR point of view of LIFE is YOUR OWN, UNIQUE, POINT OF VIEW of THIS UNIQUE MANIFESTATION in space-time.

You have the FREE-WILL to CHOOSE between FEED WELL BEING or BAD BEHAVIOR.

The reason people are suffering and CAUSING suffering is because they DONT KNOW, because the are TRAPPED INSIDE their heads, believing in LIES, ILLUSIONS, hunting SHADOWS. Causing pain to thenselves and each other, crushing everyone around then with their egos, SELFISHNESS, LACK OF LOVE, LACK OF COMPASSION, LACK OF COMPREHENSION, Because they DONT KNOW, or DONT WANT TO KNOW, how their mind/ body works. They are ignorant, not by their faults, but by the fault of the collective unconscious, that TRANSMITS all the LIES througout the ages, misleading people, creating PSYCHOTIC BEHAVIOUR, a BIG WAVE of FEAR of death, echoing through all Earth, reflecting in BEING. FEAR creates FEAR, ANGER creates ANGER, RAGE creates RAGE, because we are MIRRORS of each other, MIRRORS of how we DEAL with OTHERS. What you Get is what you Give, AND THIS FOREVER WILL BE.

YOU are in the COMPLETE CONTROL of ANYTHING that comes towards you, and your RESPONSE DEPENDS on your STATE OF MIND, and that changes how your BODY will correspond with EMOTIONS.

EMOTIONS are vibrational patterns of Heart, Gut, Glands, BRAIN.

The controller of EVERYTHING IN YOU is your MIND.

KNOW yourself, and you'll have the KEY to the universe.

KNOW your mind, and you'll gain CONTROL OVER EMOTIONS, AFTER THAT you will gain complete control over YOURSELF and experience life as IT IS and not by EXTERNAL TRUTHS, NOT BY ""GIVEN FACTS"".

Its not a ""switch"" you can flip and everything will come into place, you need to FOCUS, you need to have FAITH IN YOURSELF, you need to LEARN to LISTEN to your body, you need to KNOW WHAT are YOUR TRUTHS, YOUR BELIEFS, what WORKS FOR YOU and what is another POINT OF VIEW, diverging FROM YOU.

YOU HAVE A CHOICE, ALWAYS HAD and ALWAYS will, you will ALWAYS have the last word about ANYTHING that comes to you, because thats how reality works and its ALL in YOUR MIND, and its YOU and ONLY YOU that can change that, whatever way suits you best based on your HEART, your LOVE, your PASSION.

Follow your HEART

spirituality,"Sometimes you just need to let nature heal you. Don‚Äôt regret anything, just learn, and love all","I wasn‚Äôt feeling very good today and I even cried. I realized a simple solution to the problem and now I feel super charged. I was spending most of my time in the house always looking at my phone, spent a lot of time online on other things like a ps4 and my computer. Phone, then another device, then back to phone before I slept. I was feeling awful. 

Solution was simple. I went outside, grabbed my chair, and meditated in nature. For the first time in awhile I actually enjoyed meditation. Maybe the signs that caused me to go out to meditate was the universe trying to get me to go out there and get healed for real. Not talking just a jog, but I meditated for about 20
Minutes, then I just accepted the universe, god, Gaia, love, everything. I realized everything is a lesson. I‚Äôm not done learning lessons. So I‚Äôm ready for it. Lessons, lessons, lessons. It‚Äôs what it all is. I have them, you have them, we all have them.

spirituality,"If you avoid conflict to keep the peace, you start a war inside yourself. My story inside","Hi everyone, I have been looking ""lurking"" through this sub for months and I absolutely like the vibe and energy around here, I just want to pour my heart just for the sake of it even if none read or give me solutions I guess its only good to get somethings of my chest.

I have been living in a huge turmoil in the last couple of years, I have been in accidents, near death situations which absolutely changed my perspective on life. 
long story short (and I hope some people understand what I'm about to say) Basically because I have lived through pain and suffering for a long time I took it upon myself not to cause pain on anyone or anything at all. 

After a short period of my unfortunate life situations I wont say I had an awakening cause I dont like labeling experiences but I had a revelation of sort I was absolutely living in peace everything was going smooth and ironically thats not how life always works.

People I knew from my past started surfacing in my life, people who absolutely screwed me over really bad in the past they wanted to reconnect and be part of life again. ""naively"" me I prematurely accepted their peace offering and made them part of my life again. 

Idk what to say cause this is the hardest part  I got screwed over 100x more this time the problem is I totally take the full responsibility and blame myself for everything that happened to me I willingly gave up my own power to these people not deliberately but because of this revelation/awakening that I had that some may even call it ego deathI was living through.

I tried to be more patient and more open and accepting I am an extremely empathetic person I totally get where people are coming from even their short comings. 
I just dont know how to say this but in the past couple of months it felt like something or a thing took my ability to react I felt like a sponge I just kept absorbing and absorbing all the shit coming from anyone and I couldn't react at all, I kept giving people benefit of the doubt give them excuses take the high road and didn‚Äôt even know that what I was doing was slowly screwing with my head and overall health.

Until one day something huge happened from someone I never thought would happen from and it was my breaking point I didn't do anything to them I just left and that was my downfall. I went into a depressive episode that lasted for a year or so I was absolutely living like a numb person and everything thing that happened to me in the past came to haunt me back all the negativity I have been absorbing all my short comings and weakness screwed me real hard.
I was living with panic attacks and anxiety I was basically paranoid and the hardest part was the people who took my kindness for weakness. 
I just dont want to write much about this ""dark time"" cause I guess most of us went through this dark night of the soul. 

I started reading about shadow work and that I have been suppressing my shadow and it was the hardest thing I could ever do with facing my demons and weaknesses and admitting it to myself damn that was absolutely hard!  Now after all I went through I started rebuilding my esteem bit by bit again I cut all the negative people from my life and I guess life is starting to get more kinder to me now.

Now the absolute dilemma Im living with right now is Im starting to stand up to myself again Im becoming more assertive and I draw lines again I stood up to a lot of people who screwed me before and they didn't like it so I cut them off without even blinking. The shadow work I did made me notice a vast endless power that I never knew I had in me before.

The problem is Im still afraid to ""Act"" when I find myself in conflicts or situations when any problems arise I get paralyzed its like part of my older self still wants to seek peace above anything, and other part of me want to act and do and to make me stand my own ground affirmatively, basically I am damned if I do and I am damned if I dont. If I dont react my old wounded self keep reminding me again and again of all the times I didn't act and got screwed over and if I act I keep blaming myself that I could be hurting someone even if they are the one initiating the problem cause I rarely initiate a conflict and like this quote ""If you avoid conflict to keep the peace, you start a war inside yourself"" and that is the turmoil Im living with how can I continue the path of enlightenment and spirituality while being brave and affirmative?

Any possible solutions to what I stated above will be absolutely welcomed if you want share same experience as I had above Im more willing to listen.

This took me four or five minutes, but I wanted to hear what she had to tell me. Once I found the page, I began running my finger all over the page until I got to the right spot. This is page 53 of children's book named ""When the Tripods Came"" [photo](https://imgur.com/a/2LXvJep). I have only ever read it once and it has no significance.

spirituality,You don't have to improve yourself. You don't have to do better. It's OK to relax.,"I see this message a lot: change your habits, lift yourself up by your bootstraps, do better, etc.  Only then will you be happy.

If you are miserable, it is your fault.  You are not trying hard enough.  Work harder.

It's true, in a way, that if you are miserable, it is your fault.  But the question is not one of ""doing better"".  The question is not one of changing habits. The question, rather, is one of **changing your perspective.**  Life, no matter how awesome we arrange it, is always going to have its shortcomings.  We're only human.  Sadness, frustration, and loss are a part of the game no matter what.

Can we work to limit these things?  Yes.  We can, and we should.

But even if we achieve our dreams, what then?  Will that make us happy?  Perhaps in the short-term.  But then what?  Then we'll be coming up with some new dreams, some new goals.  And meanwhile life keeps escaping us.

So all I am saying is that you can make your life a blessing NOW.  Accept your humanity, accept your weakness, accept your lack of control.  Accept and love yourself deeply.  Don't try to improve upon life... it is already in such harmony!  Accept these things, and suddenly, even coal becomes a diamond.

There is beauty in sadness, hardship, and in fragility.  If everything were sunshine and roses, it would all be very empty.  

Enjoy the little things.  Some of us have been hit hard by the quarantine... and that is an issue, yes, but I like to think that most of us here are not in danger of losing everything.  For many of us, the biggest problem we have right now is a sudden surge in free time.  So enjoy it!  Enjoy sleeping in.  Enjoy wasting time on Netflix.  Enjoy video games.  Enjoy getting in touch with old friends.  Now is your chance!

And in general, way beyond this situation.  Enjoy love, enjoy sex, enjoy rest, enjoy good food.  Who told you these things were wrong?  If you cannot enjoy the simple pleasures of life, what *can* you enjoy?  If you cannot fall in love, how can you love yourself?

And don't get me wrong, because the old conditioning will come in.  So I'm not saying to do more.  I'm saying to **do less**.  On whatever level you are able to.

Just trust, be patient.. relax.  The miracle of life is all around us.  Sometimes we just have to open up our perspective a bit.",1586215898.0

spirituality,What Enlightenment REALLY is.,"Most of us believe that enlightenment is something to attain. We have a concept of what it is in our minds. But the mere act of *thinking* about enlightenment is what confuses us so deeply.

Enlightenment is not *thinking* you are one with the universe. It‚Äôs not trusting that the universe will keep you and your friends alive, or get you the things you want in life. This is a very Western (and selfish) view of Eastern philosophy.

Enlightenment (or Nirvana) is simply letting go of this human body. It‚Äôs letting the universe do what it does. It‚Äôs knowing that if this body dies, the universe goes on. Everything continues. Everything is eternal. In the end‚Äîthe *true* end‚Äîeverything will be okay. Because there *is* no end. It has always been okay. It *is* okay. The simple fact that you exist is enough to be at peace.

Anyone who says, ‚ÄúI am enlightened,‚Äù does not know what it is to be *truly* watching. Anyone who preaches the ‚Äútruth,‚Äù does not really *know* the truth. Anyone who spreads the ‚ÄúLord‚Äôs word,‚Äù does not know that the Lord‚Äôs word is not word at all! It‚Äôs silent. It‚Äôs breathing. It‚Äôs moving. It‚Äôs still. It‚Äôs the entire universe working together in harmony. To think that we are apart from this one, vast organism is primitive thinking. To believe that the human brain‚Äîa speck of dust within this world‚Äîcan discover the universe‚Äôs secrets is a fool‚Äôs belief. These secrets are right before us!

I don't know why people make snide comments about other countries. Every place has it's own problems but this tribalistic ""oh wow what a shithole we're a better country"" or whatever I find really gross. 

It doesn't matter if you are from Brazil, Nigeria, India, Romania, USA or wherever you are in the world. I'm a strong believer that there are good, loving people in every corner of the world. These people are often overpowered by people with more selfish goals in mind.

I find myself sometimes fantasizing about exploring my own country or taking a plane to Brazil (or any other country) and living there for a long time. I can't achieve this because I'm pretty broke right now but I hope someday I can! Other cultures are just too bloody fantastic.

spirituality,Motivation for Meditation- For those who struggle to sit on their bum each day this one's for you,"Although I‚Äôve been on this journey for quite some time, it took me the first two years to find the reason to make meditation a daily habit, so, I would like to share with you what it was that gave me that final push. I would also like to share the changes I have found within myself since I started daily meditation in the past six months to help motivate you further.

&amp;#x200B;

Meditation was completely against my grain. I spent the first two years devouring book after book because as I understand the main goal of meditation is to see reality as it truly is, I thought I might be able to achieve this through the intellect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did come across some mind-altering books in this time, that did indeed change the way I viewed myself and the world from duality to non- duality, yet this did only reach the intellect and was not deep enough. Did I think I was one with everything? Yes! Did that change how I interacted with the world? Unfortunately not. I'd have to experience the truth to see it, not just read about it.

&amp;#x200B;

So finally, I admitted I will have to meditate to understand. I would sit and oh, the frustration! Only a couple of breaths and my mind would be off in hell somewhere. So, I‚Äôd bring it back, again and again, and again. I thought this was supposed to be relaxing?! I would have to use such will power to keep hold of my breath I was more stressed than when I started!

&amp;#x200B;

This called for further research as I was sure I couldn‚Äôt have been doing it right. I found it wasn‚Äôt exactly what I was doing was wrong, it was my understanding that was wrong. I thought I was in charge but I wasn‚Äôt. There is no I to be in charge. Once I understood that this identity we have is just like a river made from the reflections of our experience, there was no I to hold on to and I learned meditation was the art of letting it all go.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned in order to get passed the initial struggle, it did not call for will power at all but wisdom power. The wisdom to know, ‚Äòthis too, shall pass‚Äô. Once I let my thoughts flow like a river, I would no longer try to catch thoughts and tell myself, no! I would just let them pass and return to the breath. I would no longer set a timer and I would not expect anything so there was no pressure. I used techniques to anchor myself and I found the wonderful breath and oh, yes it is wonderful. If you can get yourself here, the peace you can find will be enough to keep practising.

&amp;#x200B;

All my life, since I can remember, up to the last few months I was anxiety-ridden and deeply depressed from unresolved trauma. Getting out of bed every day would be a struggle. Most days I would cry, even in public, I couldn‚Äôt control it. I would avoid people and I would dread each and every social interaction. I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone to accept me because I for sure didn‚Äôt! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I wake up most days with a smile. Life has turned into HD. I accept myself. When I see people, they no longer scare me and instead I do my best to make them smile. My ability to stay present is increasing all the time. I‚Äôm no longer trying to fill my days to serve the future but to serve others.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish I started sooner!

spirituality,"(2020) Rebirth | A documentary about psychedelics being the catalyst for the psychological evolution of human beings. Their demonization by society is due to their ability to upend the system. Ushering a paradigm shift that will change the world. Inspired by Bill Hicks, Graham Hancock, Alan Watts +","# Link to presentation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjqiye1TYx0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjqiye1TYx0)

Based on 'Supernatural: Meetings With The Ancient Teachers of Mankind'. Written by Graham Hancock.

The final instalment of the Awakening Documentaries. Evidence has been surmounting to support the theory that Psychedelic plants played a key role in the psychological evolution of Human beings. The use of psychedelics not only coincides with the rise of art and culture, but they are also directly associated with the genesis of all religious based and spiritual traditions. These key agents for our evolution have been demonized by our society, due to the cultural stigma created by the war on drugs. Stunting our evolution as a species. And during this time, where humanity threatens to destroy itself &amp; the planet, Ayahuasca -- the most powerful psychedelic in the world -- emerges from the Amazon jungle with a message for the human race‚Ä¶

Rebirth is a documentary that dissolves the artificial boundaries we‚Äôve created. It shows how all religions are a valid path to gnosis, especially when decoding their underlying view of reality. It is a documentary that explores the deepest mysteries of the universe, while attempting to bridge the gap between science and spirituality. I hope you watch it in-full, as a book can only be truly understood if read in-full.

spirituality,Why I don't wish on shooting stars anymore,"I was having a really good night the other night. A friend messaged me and wants to come visit and I'm just in a positive place.

I went outside to smoke and I saw a shooting star. My mind starting thinking of what I want to wish for and I stopped myself and just said, ""I wish for what I already have.""

This was freeing, because instead of being overcome with greed and ruining the moment, I was able to just replay the shooting star in my mind and enjoy the moment.

Disney programmed us to wish upon a star. That's consumer culture. You always yearn for something you don't have and therefore can never be happy, so you'll keep buying stuff. When you stop this, and just thank the universe for what it shows you, there is a deep sense on contentment.

I'm not trying to sell you something, so I can tell you things unbiased truth. Everything is within you. You don't need to want for anything. When you see a shooting star or any sign, don't feel the need to ask for something. Just be thankful for what you have and watch how the world starts to just unfold in front of you.

People sell you the Law of Attraction which makes you think you have to ask the universe for stuff. I didn't ask for that meteor to crash through our atmosphere, but the universe gave it to me anyway and it was a special experience. 

I hope this helps others struggling to find their way. The universe has a plan and you're just one piece of it. Just be present and watch what happens.",1597749395.0

And it‚Äôs made me go crazy. I‚Äôve realised how much the society that we live in tries to lower our vibration and I‚Äôm so angry that the ‚Äòhigher up‚Äô people have this much control over me. 
Also, I‚Äôve been having realisations every day. I discover something new about myself or come to new realisations about how the world actually is and how time isn‚Äôt real and we‚Äôre all just one collective consciousness and it‚Äôs freaking me out a bit. Everyone seems to think I‚Äôm crazy when I talk about it and I feel so alone. I feel so anxious and depressed while also feeling like I‚Äôm being freed from all the lies I‚Äôve been fed.

spirituality,The words you speak hold more weight than you realize. Choose carefully,"Each word in the English language, just like each person, each place, and each event, carries a certain frequency. But because words are used so often collectively, they carry a much heavier energetic weight than we realize. 

Moving into the 21st century, humanity is beginning to awaken. Our biggest responsibility is to raise the frequencies of ourselves and those around us. This will help dissolve the old paradigms and make way for newer, more beautiful ways of life. 

And since our biggest responsibility is to raise the vibration of the planet, we must stop using low vibration words. Even words like ‚Äúbad, negative, lame, unfortunate, fight,‚Äù and so on carry lower frequencies. These frequencies manifest around us.

They say mother Theresa would never join an anti war protest. Rather she would only join pro peace protests. Why? Because when we pursue anti-war, we are really resonating on the same frequency as war. We are fighting war‚Äôs battle, and therefore perpetuating war. But joining a pro peace protest holds a completely different frequency.

Language is one of THE MOST powerful tools we have. Use it wisely. We must spread love, beauty and positivity with our words, not the alternate. I believe this will create a change more profound than we realize.

spirituality,"It‚Äôs okay (and I recommend) to let yourself experience anxiety, depression, stress, sadness, confusion, and loss of faith after a period of spiritual awakening and bliss","Hi all, I just wanted to share something that I have struggled with but recently found a way to reduce my suffering over. I see a lot of people have a hard time w this in these sort of subreddits so I hope my experience can help. 

I had a spiritual awakening initially through psychedelics, meditation, and therapy a few years back. Looking back (through a biased lens I‚Äôm sure) I felt a sense of awakening, fascination, motivation, bliss, cultivation of faith, and dramatic healing. People around me noticed and came to me for advice and company. It felt good. I felt like I was truly experiencing stages of enlightenment and continued to cultivate these feelings for years. I still had hard moments - my parents divorce, abusive bosses, a dramatic moving out, and all the other general hard life stuff of your early 20s. But I still felt this net positive. 

Recently these sort of feelings have faded. I found myself rolling my eyes at spiritual teachings that once made me cry tears of happiness. I completely lost faith in meditation as something I should do, I fell back into deeply addictive patterns, and all that good stuff. It *mostly* felt like I had just reverted to a pre-awakening state. However, there was the memory of this previous period that gave me faith that it would be ok. Once I recognized this, I just let the suffering and world take me. I let go of any feeling of ‚ÄúI ought to meditate‚Äù ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be struggling with x or y‚Äù etc. I just let myself be the way I was. And I‚Äôm okay. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfall off the track‚Äù or lose my way. I realized that this period is just as spiritually significant as the one before it. Less flashy and blissful and exciting, but just as important if not more. It gave me a lot of perspective on other people suffering too. During my initial awakening period, I definitely had the view of ‚Äúwow my friend sure is depressed, why doesn‚Äôt he just meditate or listen to this lecture?‚Äù Now I lived in a world where I had done all of that - I had all my memories and experiences with deep spirituality and I was still struggling. I saw myself in all of my friends I had previously had a judgmental confusion about. I had the epiphany that it‚Äôs not only about what you choose to listen, study, or do - it‚Äôs also about your own personal life path (or karma if you believe that) and what sort of suffering you need to go through. I realized I had to go through these darker sides of my soul with all my renewed perspective so I could look at them more compassionately. 

Let yourself go through these dark periods. Don‚Äôt fight them if they feel inevitable. You will survive. You will reinforce your faith or belief. You will come out stronger and more well rounded. Let yourself live in your neuroses and bad habits. Just keep awareness. You can‚Äôt ever forget where you‚Äôve been. These hard experiences are just as spiritual and will have a huge impact on your life. Through this you will realize you are always free no matter the contents of your mind. 

And of course, continue doing your best to heal. During this period I continued therapy and used CBD, but I didn‚Äôt latch onto the idea that I should be super happy and not have any problems. 

Hope some of you at least found this interesting if not relatable!

Edit: just to add on, this period made me realize the importance of exercise and eating enough consistently as well. These dark periods are showing us something and it‚Äôs good to find new methods of awakening. For me it‚Äôs been cardio exercise this time!",1561312858.0

It is not because of more stress, more discomfort, more tenseness but because we feel so much relieved, satisfied, assured or want to feel secured, satisfied, assured by addition to possessions, relations, ideas that we do not recognize the fact that brain operates though contrasts only.

We have been cultured to believe that we can remain pleased, relieved, satisfied, if not now then in future when we get a good degree, good job, promotion, more money, possessions or by religious-spiritual ideas, activities.

This thinking keeps us in- 

Waiting mode, we live superficially.

Frustration sets in as nothing can give you stable relief.

Every time contrast is being created between ‚Äòwhat you want‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat happens or what you think should happen‚Äô. You have to be comfortable with this contrast, this gap, this discomfort, if you call it so. This contrasting process is life, it never stops. 

The comfortableness with contrast puts you on the fluid ground, the ground of all possibilities.

Brain can not see, visualize, think, experience anything, which is not a contrast including any feeling. Brain can not work without contrast. Desire, uncertainty, any problem, any disliked situation provide contrast to manifestation, to what you want. This is the endless process.

Just notice your pattern:

1. You are working as compulsion and seek relief by entertainments, holidays, intoxications, religious-spiritual ideas, activities.

2. You want to feel relieved, satisfied about result, about tomorrow now.

3. You resort to solacing ideas when you face irritating, discomforting situations.

4. When any difficult problem is solved or you acquire something ‚Äì you think as if relief, pleasure you experience will be stabilised.

5. You think as if some one else (guru and so on) has solved the enigma of life as a comfortable end or is living as psychologically comforted.

6. You think as if you can find flawless choices and be relieved.

Just being aware of the pattern causes a short-circuit in the pattern. You are face to face with the fundamental resistance of being human. 

You are on the Original ground.",1602269369.0

We should wipe out the hurt. We should accept, surrender, laugh, live in bliss, peace and joy - that‚Äôs the way to happiness!

spirituality,Offering gratitude whenever a negative thought comes up.,"Earlier this week there was a day I woke up and early in the morning I noticed a pattern of negative thoughts during my morning routine. Mostly silly things but negative in nature, and then it came to me. Whenever I had a negative thought I would stop and think to myself. 
- I‚Äôm grateful to be aware of this negative thought 
And I would try to emit an inner feeling of gratitude towards this awareness. Within moments the pattern reversed and I had a more positive thought pattern going on.

spirituality,"If you pay close enough attention, you will notice that deeply spiritual people all move invariably with the same cadence and flow.","I  was in the mental hospital once.  It sucked.  Of course it did.   HOWEVER.  I had an experience in the hospital that was but an inkling of  what was to come, as I went back into the world, and particularly for  me, went back to AA.  I got a chance to meet the chaplain, while I was  in there.  He was cool shit.  He knew how to speak to people.  He had  this care, a comfort, and a confidence in him that was profoundly true,    and I noticed that his movements, unlike mine which were rigid and  shitty, had a rhythm and a flow.  He spoke with a soothing rhythm, he  moved with a soothing rhythm.  This dude was rocking in the rhythm of  the moment.  Apparently you can see experts of dialectical behavioral  therapy rock in the rhythm also.  Come to think of it there was someone  else in the hospital who rocked in the rhythm. I cant remember what she  did but she was very kind.  Very aware.  At some point, likely after I  told her during my psychosis I believed the 12 steps were inside of me,  she informed me that she had done the steps herself, and she assured me  of their power.  She didn‚Äôt do them for alcohol, but she didn‚Äôt disclose  what her catalyst was.  Even better.  Just letting me know the power of  the steps when I doubted the most.  That‚Äôs why she was there, what a  gift.

As I went back to AA, I  started to notice the different ways that people carried themselves, and  the ways they spoke.  Some were hunched and mumbled, some proud and  egoic, but some of them...some of these people were mutants.  I could  see it in them, and hear the truth for the first time.  You haven‚Äôt  heard the truth until you‚Äôve heard it uttered by an old hillbilly with  no teeth who hasn‚Äôt showered in a month.  That‚Äôs some unadulterated  truth right there.

Its like once I  saw the rhythm in these people I couldn‚Äôt unsee it, and suddenly they  were like roided up cartoon characters as far as I was concerned,  heaving with spirit muscle.  But they just weren‚Äôt moving.  When a  spiritual person moves, its like poetry.  But the real power is watching  them rock in the rhythm without moving.  I watched this guy chair a  meeting, that‚Äôs the person who shares their story first.  This guy told  this crazy story about drugs, and money, and jail time, and arson.  He  told it with calm and authority.  He leaned back in his chair, its like  he was at attention and at rest at the same time.  He was nothing like  me.  But his story was so powerful I found him at his car after the  meeting and asked him if he had a moment.  He turned, said my name, and  asked ‚Äúwhat can I do for you?‚Äù

I  was surprised to say the least.  In a room full of 40 people, he  remembered my name from going around the room at the beginning.  Just  the one time.  He was rocking in the rhythm so hard, he was paying such  close attention, that that reaction came to him as effortlessly as me  yelling ‚Äúhey.‚Äù  Maybe more effortlessly because I didn‚Äôt want to bother  him.  The more someone is rocking in the rhythm of the beat of the  moment, the more the moment is accessible to them.  They experience more  and process faster.  They know what to do, they know what to say.  They  don‚Äôt move much.  They don‚Äôt speak much.  Pay attention to how people  move, and I guarantee if they have true cadence and flow, they‚Äôre down  with the rhythm.  I also guarantee they see hear, taste, smell, and feel  more than the rest of us do.  Because they are more inherently and  solidly grounded to the rhythm of the beat.

It  doesn‚Äôt even matter what they practice, that‚Äôs the point.  They all  rock the same way.  The twelve steps for instance act as a universal  translator, like in star trek.  You work steps, you‚Äôre getting in the  rhythm.  There‚Äôs obviously plenty of ways to get in the rhythm, this is  just the one I see around me personally.  You work steps, you find a  higher power, you‚Äôre essentially training your brain to understand that  it is without a doubt not even remotely alone.  It‚Äôs inside of  everything else.  And you rock in that rhythm instead of your own.  Cuz  your own rhythm sucked.  Check it out if you ever get the chance.  Watch  how they move.  I don‚Äôt know about you but I want to rock in the rhythm  so hard it kicks me back all the way to the cosmic moment, where it all  begins, the big bang beat.

My deepest desires include finding a social connection and community with people I value the most, playing songs and dancing and drawing art with them, hunting and foraging for food together and calling it a day by a bonfire. 

Even in an evolutionary context, we have not moved on from the hunter-gatherer/nomadic lifestyle yet. We lived that for hundreds of thousands of years and everything about modern society is just so new. I attribute some of my feelings to that but it also feels like I was a hunter-gatherer in a previous life and I've suddenly been thrown into this world of insane technological marvel and magic.

I'm more than grateful to be born in this time to a good family with good friends and the opportunity to be who I want. I can get food delivered, a taxi or just about anything that I need/want with just a few clicks of a button on my magic brick. It is actually magic and something we take for granted.

Yet, I feel like I just kind of adapted to all this and I'm living with it because our era demands it. I value my experiences with other people more than anything in the world.

spirituality,Remember to always question spiritual teachers,"Some people might find this post offensive but I feel it needs to be said. 

I‚Äôve found it easy to get sucked into the teachings of one ‚Äòspiritual guru‚Äô or another. 

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with looking up to someone or wanting to learn from them or believing in what they have to say, but as the teachings of Buddhism apparently mention, always remember to take everything with a grain of salt and keep room for you to not get attached to any particular doctrines and ideals. Question every idea you are taught. 

The reason I say this is because many ‚Äòenlightened leaders‚Äô over the years have and continue to be false prophets - antisocial Individuals who use ‚Äòspiritual master‚Äô as a pathway to control and god-like praise. 

I see many people and forums online spreading the teachings of people like Osho, forgetting he ran one of America‚Äôs most infamously violent cults. Or Mooji, who is exposed online every day with video evidence depicting similar cult-like behaviours. 

Even Jesus had some contradictory teachings that when questioned, could paint him in the light of simply someone with a messiah complex. 

The truth is we do not know who is really a spiritual master and who is simply a delusional manipulator. There‚Äôs absolutely no way to tell for sure. 

Always question the possibilities. Always question your beliefs. Always question the teachings of others.

To me, the book is basically be your true self, carnal and not carnal. It's okay to be yourself. It's quite alright to be human. But you are in charge of your own reality, you are your own god or goddess. And also if somebody mistreats you, it's okay to fire back, nothing to the extreme of course.

Everything is one with the universe.","Upon opening my third eye potently and having it open for a few hours I thought I would share my story and give you guys some good vibes today and days after when other people read it. It's the story of how me opening my third eye erased all my fears, fear of death, fear of anything you can think of and made me realize we are the universe. Here it is. 

 You are, the leader, the creator, the judge and the jury of your own universe. Your mind is a powerful tool, more powerful then you know. We as humans trick ourselves into believing we're all individuals, everyone is different with different personalities and basically nobody's the same. Which is true to an extent, we are all different in the lives we live, the people we care about, the way we talk to people, but we are all ONE. One conciousness. Experiencing the same thing at the same time. When I opened my third eye, I was embraced by the most LOVE I've ever felt in my entire life. It was the universe, God, ( we are god and the universe, kinda like how Jesus came down as a human but he was still "" the father and the son"" at the same time. Not trying to push religion because Im talking about the spiritual journey as humans not formed religion) anyways, I was crying because the experience was so powerful. Basically it told me, ( not through words but communicated through feelings) that everything I worry about, my fear of death, fear of people's opinion, etc etc was meaningless. There's nothing to be afraid of. In the end, everything WILL be 100% okay and that the point of life is to just enjoy every second and live to the fullest. I now know when I die, I will go back into the universe, just as I was before this life. We, humans are here, conscious so the universe can perceive ITSELF. If there were no conscious beings throughout the universe, how could anything ever know it exists? How could anything see the beauty of anything? Which is why conciousness was developed, and we‚Äôre here now. We are the universe, experiencing this human life, because we (the universe) decided to. The reason this knowledge isn't already built into our mind, is because it kind of takes away from the human experience. If we knew we were the universe right off the bat, we wouldn't be doing what the universe intended for us to do. Living and experiencing the Human life. That's why we grow up, have hardships, fall in and out of love, have bad times, have amazing times, because we as the universe WANTED to experience all of that. A world where we can basically do whatever we want. Have a family, make some money, get passionate about sports, or video games, or anything you find interest in. That's why everyone is so different. The universe (us) wanted to experience every kind of life. Even the worst life you can imagine. Because in the end, we will transition right back to the universe, with the most love you will ever feel. If you look into near death experiences, or people dying in general there's a common theme of happiness upon letting go. Your pineal gland is releasing DMT upon death, it's basically the universe telling you it's okay to let go, come back to us, your true family. If you want to open your third eye and experience this for yourself, I have to say it would take time, listening to meditation music, becoming one. Letting go to the experience. I personally experienced this on a dose of LSD recently, I took the easy way out and can't recommend you do this but I know the same states can be achieved through meditation. The LSD kinda forces your third eye to open up, if you can't do it yourself. I became one with everything. Psychedelics are called psychedelics for a reason, it changes your perception into a point of view and shows you things your two human eyes can't see. I had my eyes open when I was embraced by my true universal family, the universe itself, but I also closed my eyes and could continue to see the same thing. Having my eye open would just overlay the experience over reality. Just don't doubt yourself. You have the power, you CAN get to where you want to go even if you have no clue which direction to walk. Sometimes you just have to take a random path, and see what you can do. Just know, everything will always be okay in the end, no matter how down and out you feel about yourself. I'm hoping on your journey of enlightment you come to the same conclusion I do and realize how awesome life can be once this is realized. Thanks for reading if you did, willing to listen to others opinions and talk.


Also, for anyone curious, LSD is something to be cautioned about. It is not for everyone, I've had some of the most scary experiences in my life on LSD where I thought I was going to lose my mind forever, but I also had the best experiences of my life. Do a lot of research if you ever consider doing a psychedelic, like I said it is NOT for everyone and can be very dangerous given a bad setting, a bad situation, a BAD LSD TAB. Just be cautious, I didn't want this post to sound like "" yeahhh try drugs"". I just happened to have a spiritual awakening on LSD, so it had to be mentioned. Thanks again. ",1542304030.0
spirituality,8 Law of Attraction Tips from Abraham Hicks to Manifest with Ease,"


Manifesting should be easy. But we create resistance. I love how Abraham Hicks breaks down basic Law of Attraction principles with humor and class in their popular workshops. And in February, I had the good fortune of attending the San Francisco workshop in person. I laughed, got calibrated, and had a blast! AND I took LOTS of notes to share what I learned with YOU! In this post, I‚Äôm sharing 8 Law of Attraction Tips from Abraham Hicks to Manifest with Ease.

8 Abraham Hicks Law of Attraction Tips
Learn how to manifest with ease with these 8 Law of Attraction tips from Abraham Hicks - one of the BEST teachers of the Law of Attraction 

#1 Negative Thoughts Are Good
Whaaaaaaat?! I know! Shocking!

But one thing Abraham teaches about a lot is the idea of ‚Äúcontrast.‚Äù That when you see something you don‚Äôt want, you also know what you DO want! Sometimes contrast is good and even needed to help us understand what we do want and what to focus our manifestations towards.

In this workshop, Abraham explained that when you encounter something you don‚Äôt want, you launch ‚Äúrockets of desire‚Äù the other way towards what you do want and place what you do want into your ‚ÄúVortex.‚Äù Note: The Vortex is a big Abraham concept, so hopefully you‚Äôre familiar, but drop a comment if you‚Äôd like an post for it.

My Takeaway: when you encounter a negative thought, focus on the opposite ‚Äì what you DO want. Keep your thoughts on the positive ‚Äúend of the stick.‚Äù

#2 Don‚Äôt Assert. Attract.

When we manifest, sometimes we try to *make* the manifestation happen. We put so much effort into it. We try to assert it. As a Type-A personality, I totally get this. Because I‚Äôve tried it.

Abraham explained in the workshop that when you‚Äôre asserting, you‚Äôre manipulating.

But you can‚Äôt assert or manipulate a manifestation into happening.

Instead, you have to sit back and attract it. You don‚Äôt have to script everyday to make a manifestation work. What you want is already in the Vortex, your job now is to allow it. To do things that make you feel good so you can get into the right frequency to attract it.

My Takeaway: Remember to not manipulate manifestations and get into energetic alignment with what you want instead.

#3 Memories and Past Are Foes of Where You‚Äôre Going

The topic of therapy came up, and Abraham said that they don‚Äôt really like therapy. This was interesting for me because one thing I‚Äôve been exploring is how past emotional trauma can impact us in the now. And how releasing emotional trauma can help you with health, happiness, clarity of thought, and MUCH more.

Abraham explained this one with an example: If you were sitting on a train and on one side was a junkyard and on the other was an ocean view, would you have to clean up the junkyard to look at the ocean? No! You just choose to look that way.

According to Abraham, the same can be said of memories and the past. When we think about those things, we can sometimes calibrate to lower vibrational experiences and get back into that lower energy. So instead of thinking about memories and the past, the idea is to choose to look at the ‚Äúocean view‚Äù.

My Takeaway: Whilst I‚Äôm still balancing this with what I‚Äôve been learning about emotional trauma, I do think it‚Äôs important to not wallow in the past and calibrate to it. I intend to focus towards the future and calibrate to the good.

Speaking of calibration‚Ä¶

#4 Don‚Äôt Calibrate to Unstable Things

Abraham noted that we humans often calibrate to unstable things. The main thing we talked about here is calibrating to other people instead of calibrating to our Inner Being.

We allow someone with a lower vibe to take us to lower vibration too.

For example, you‚Äôre feeling good and you‚Äôre aligned and then you run into someone who‚Äôs having a bad day. Next thing you know, you‚Äôve lowered your frequency to match theirs and not be too happy in the face of their bad day.

My Takeaway: Remember to calibrate to your Inner Being and keep your vibration strong around others.

#5 You Can‚Äôt Change the Way Someone Feels About You, But You Can Change the Way YOU Feel About Someone Else

A woman got in the hot seat, and she was really upset that she could be in a high vibe when she was on her own, but she‚Äôd get low vibe around her mom. She felt like her mom was disappointed in her, and this caused the woman a lot of low vibe feelings.

Abraham explained that the woman couldn‚Äôt change the way her mom looked at her life choices and whether she was disappointed or not. But the woman COULD look at her mom differently. She could see that her mom was acting out of love because she wanted success for her daughter but had a different definition of what that was.

My Takeaway: When you‚Äôre feeling upset by how someone feels about you, remember that you can‚Äôt control them and trying to do so will only upset you. Instead, choose to see that person differently. See how they can ultimately be acting out of love.

#6 Be Thrilled About the Process of Your Manifestation Coming Together, Not Just It Arriving

When you are only excited at your manifestation having arrived, you miss out on the fun of life. Abraham wants us to be thrilled as the manifestation is coming together. Eagerly observing how the various ‚Äúcooperative components‚Äù are coming together. And enjoying the full process.

Not enjoying the process is like buying a new house and being miserable from the house hunting to the decorating because you‚Äôre just so frustrated the house isn‚Äôt fully set up yet and WHY is it taking so long!

It‚Äôs much more enjoyable to have fun with the end-to-end experience.

My Takeaway: Find ways to enjoy the process of your manifestation coming together. Get excited when you notice little pieces coming together.

#7 How to Understand Your Vibration

Curious about your vibration. Here are 2 ways to find out how - so easy! 
This one is simple.

Abraham said there are two ways to understand your vibration:

   1. How you feel
   2. How things are turning out for you

How You Feel

When you are aligned with your inner being, you feel great and ‚Äúfrisky‚Äù. Your vibe is high. Your Inner Being is pure, positive energy, so if you feel anything else, that means you‚Äôre out of alignment and/or low vibe.

How Things Are Turning Out for You
If things seem to be going wrong left and right, you‚Äôre probably not aligned to your Inner Being. Your Inner Being wants the best for you! It wants everything to work out in your favor.

#8 How to Calibrate

At the workshop, Abraham taught us a method for calibrating that I haven‚Äôt heard them teach before. So maybe it‚Äôs a newer method? Here‚Äôs how you do it.

You‚Äôll want to use this if something is throwing your vibe off or making you feel bad.

Grab a notebook
On the left side ‚Äì write down what‚Äôs bothering you and how it‚Äôs making you feel
On the right side ‚Äì write down things that help you calibrate back to your Inner Being
For example:

Your friend was upset by something you said, and now you feel like a bad person
On the left side ‚Äì write down: ‚ÄúMy friend is upset by something I said‚Äù
Add: ‚ÄúI feel like a bad friend‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel small‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm a bad person‚Äù, etc.
On the right side ‚Äì write down how you REALLY feel about yourself and use ‚Äúor‚Äù questions if it helps (this is what Abraham did): Am I a bad friend or a good friend? Good friend! Write ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good friend.‚Äù Am I a bad person or a good person?‚Äù Good person! (and keep going ‚Äì calibrating back to your Inner Being who is pure, positive energy)
Note: This one is easier to explain via video, so def watch the video for a better example.

My Takeaway: Use this calibration method to re-calibrate anytime you‚Äôre feeling off about something.

spirituality,"‚ÄúEverything you perceive, externally, is the manifestation of some internal part of you. If it was not, it would not be present in your perceived reality.‚Äù ~Tony Warrick","Hey Soul Fam(‚Äò:

Have you been trying to manifest but are struggling to see results or even progress? Manifesting seems pretty simple conceptually. Regardless, we tend to make it a lot more complicated than it needs to be. In my own journey I‚Äôve faced many blocks when trying to manifest certain things or situations, and only with time and observation have I been able to identify what some of those blocks have been for me. I‚Äôve identified 4 manifesting myths that I think anyone who is trying to manifest should know about and consider in their process. I hope that whoever comes across this finds it to be helpful, because identifying these myths and changing how I go about manifesting has truly helped me in my own journey, and I hope it does the same for you.

1. You always have to be positive
2. You have to fixate focus and obsess about your desire
3. Thoughts on their own create reality
4. You are in TOTAL control of your destiny 

Addressing these myths definitely took some work and time for me in my journey, but I do think that in essence, manifesting sabot knowing what your desire is, and taking it upon yourself to take on the role of the version of you that has already manifested that reality. Always practicing gratitude will enable you to resonate at the abundance vibration, and because of the fundamentals of the law of attraction, you will attract more abundance! Ultimately though, realizing that the Universe, Source energy, God, whatever you want to call it, as well as the intentions and energy of other powerful cosmic beings around you are all playing a part and have an influence on your experience is key. Be aware of your inner and outer environments, and always remember that things are working in your favor. Everything that has happened in your life and the lives of all who went before you, whether good or bad has brought you to this very moment, reading this very word. You are incredible, and as long as you don‚Äôt attach yourself too much to any outcome, things will unfold exactly as they need to.

If you want to hear more about these points, feel free to check out my most recent YouTube upload, I would really appreciate it. I‚Äôm almost at 500 subscribers, and I just want to say how incredibly grateful I am for every single person in this community for being so open to even hearing what I have to say. I appreciate the support I‚Äôve received so much, but at the end of the day the reason I have a channel running is to simply share with you all thoughts and information that I think you would resonate with and find valuable.

spirituality,Why do we have to work/make money just to enjoy life to the fullest? Questioning the nature of reality...,"

spirituality,Let‚Äôs just remember this while meditating.,"I see people saying ‚ÄúI suck at meditating I get so distracted.‚Äù 

Now there are various types of meditation but the most popular is mindfulness, specifically meditating on the breath and for good reason. It‚Äôs fantastic. Though it‚Äôs hard to suck at. 

People say they suck because they struggle to not get distracted. In fact getting distracted is so off putting that some of us stop meditating or find meditating difficult. Let me tell you, meditating should be the most easy, difficult thing you ever do. If it‚Äôs just difficult you should tweak your technique by remembering the following:

Becoming distracted is good. In fact, meditation is in the act of meditating. That is to say, the returning to the breath is the whole practice and hence it should be revered. Being distracted is to be celebrated. Why? Because without returning to the breath there is no meditation. The whole practice is about catching yourself becoming distracted so you can return to the breath. Once you‚Äôre hella good the only difference is that you enter deep state between noticing thoughts where time and space seemingly disappear.

When you stop becoming disheartened and annoyed by distraction and instead be grateful for being given a chance to return to the breath then you will take huge leaps in your practice.

Enjoy your meditation it is beautiful. Embrace the distraction because where there is distraction there is meditation.

spirituality,"Stuff only gets weird in transitional moments of expansion. This is because your mind is bewildered at first, then it gains it's senses and then afterward you have a new normal.","Dark night of the soul(ego loss) will happen again and again, sometimes a few times in a month, or even a week. 

Your spirit is constantly trying to shed off the excess, mainly egotistical attachments and worldly concern. Sitting in nature or meditating long enough, the full process of that shedding naturally happens. 

Flow and ego loss experiences give glimpses into the nature of the unfettered spirit. With enough glimpses, it blossoms into a deeper understanding of the ineffable nature of selfhood. 

Modern life forces us into acting out a persona to some degree. We play the persona and begin to believe we are the persona. Then you glimpse an ego loss experience and feel euphoria, you sense all new spiritual territory and there's a quick yet profound feeling of having attained some enlightenment.  

Then when the realization starts to truly set in that you're actually ineffable and you can never know yourself, there's panic and dark experiences of agonizing bewilderment that set in. Usually this results in reattaching to a previous persona.

spirituality,Went to a bar for the for the first time since starting my spiritual awakening,"I live in a fairly small town and there is one bar that all of the university students go to on the weekend. I worked there for about a year, made a lot of friends with the regulars, and other people who worked in the industry and fell into the lifestyle that working in a bar comes with. 

I quit 3 months ago. I was unfulfilled, depressed and I hated the idea that I was contributing to a part of society that wasnt very productive. I could no longer entertain the idea of getting fucked up every weekend. I lost a lot of friends who I thought I was close with. I became depressed because i thought something was wrong with me for not wanting to go out, even sober.

I went out last night for a friend's birthday. I was reluctant to go but ended up going and just being sober. For the first time, I saw the bar and industry for what it was. I ran into a lot of the old crowd I used to hang out with. All I could feel was the hurt I knew they were carrying inside. I didnt feel as close to them anymore, and I know now it's because we bonded over suppressing negative and uncomfortable emotions by drinking all the time. I was not tempted to fall back into the life I once lived, in fact it made it easier to let go of that depression and FOMO I'd been feeling.

The spiritual awakening and self-love journey has been the most difficult thing I've ever gone through in my life. There are days where I feel insane and want to die. 

Last night I recognized how far I've come. Even though I'm not through it, seeing that progress gave me the strength to go on.

spirituality,"You are not learning new things, but remembering old","If you feel like you are just beginning to learn about yourself and spirituality in general, you need to rest assured with the fact that this path you have chosen is not you learning new things, but remembering. 

For anyone who believes in past lives or reincarnation, this journey you are on today is the result of an infinite number of years in which you have been learning more about yourself, the world and each other. 

It may seem hard at first to nail down your meditation, to nail down your research and to figure everything out as fast as possible, but this journey is one which you have chosen to take as a spirit in the everlasting quest for true peace.

For some it may be easy to follow this path, and for others it will be harder, but you must take into account that you are just remembering things you have learned throughout your life as a spirit, and not learning them newly. 

Whilst we can learn new things in this life that we have never learned before, many of the things we find ourselves involved in can be attributed to many years of learning as a spirit, as we live through the lessons we have chosen for ourselves.

This one fact can be taken in our stride as we continue down our chosen paths, which are the paths we should be following.

Remember that the journey can often be better than the destination, as you continue to remember more details about why we are here and what we have come to accomplish.

spirituality,This Will SHAVE OFF Years From Your ‚ÄúSpiritual Journey‚Äù,"The purpose of meditation is to ‚Äúbecome present‚Äù or to ‚Äúconnect to your presence‚Äù, your beingness, your aliveness, your existence and to RECOGNIZE this beautiful existence as all their truly is within this NOW moment.

There‚Äôs a few things I‚Äôd like to point out that will dramatically help you save time and remove struggle or self-judgment from your spiritual journey instantaneously.

1. Realize you‚Äôre (always already) present.

You can‚Äôt turn off presence (awareness is another word for this), it‚Äôs always functioning.

It‚Äôs like a constant, 24-7 spy cam that‚Äôs always noticing everything that happens in your life.

It‚Äôs like the ocean itself feeling it‚Äôs waves rising and falling each moment.

It‚Äôs like the sun bathing the earth in a constant warm light, sometimes a piece of the earth is facing the sun and in the light and sometimes it‚Äôs not and darkness descends upon it‚Äîbut the sun is always shining on some surface of it.

It‚Äôs like sunlight shining on your face, sometimes it‚Äôs cloudy and you can‚Äôt see the light but there‚Äôs a dimness filtering through, other times it‚Äôs very sunny and warm.

You‚Äôre always existing, even when you‚Äôre asleep... when you awaken, there‚Äôs a subtle knowingness as to whether you‚Äôve had a good sleep or not and you can remember having been asleep.

2. Every experience is simply more confirmation of presence and existence.

Every experience you have is like a firework exploding in the vast, endless night sky of your existence‚Äîthe night sky being your ‚Äúawareness/presence.‚Äù

An experience is made up of presence, which is what makes up everything in existence. 

It is the fabric of reality itself.

An experience also has 3 parts to it:
1. Sensory‚Äîwhat you can see, hear, touch, smell and taste about this experience.
2. Thoughts‚Äîwhat you think about this experience, what you believe it means, what you assume about it, what you like or dislike about it.
3. Emotions‚Äîhow you‚Äôre feeling about this experience.

When we‚Äôre present to this NOW moment and connected to our presence, sensory becomes the dominant side of experience because the mental side (thinking) is completely made up.

It‚Äôs a little story we‚Äôre telling ourselves about what‚Äôs happening and what we believe it all means.

All of these thoughts are just more fireworks exploding in the night sky of your awareness.

They‚Äôre bright and vivid but eventually they disappear into the endlessness that is the sky.

And they don‚Äôt actually consume the sky itself, they are taking place within the space of it.

We can choose to emphasize and place our attention on the story side of experience or the presence side of experience which lacks thought and is extremely powerful, peaceful and relieving.

Throughout every experience, our emotional guidance system is letting us know whether how we‚Äôre thinking about this experience is in or out of alignment with how our higher self is viewing this experience.

So, if we feel terrible... what we‚Äôre actually feeling isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe truth‚Äù but simply distance.

We‚Äôre feeling that we‚Äôre far away from the actual truth of things and our built in spiritual hardware is letting us know how far away we are and how twisted this perception of reality is by how terrible or amazing we‚Äôre feeling about it.

Presence/awareness feels amazing when we relax into it by relaxing our perception or perspective of the world and start emphasizing the fact we exist and that‚Äôs all there is.

It‚Äôs inherently peaceful and rejuvenating.

The story we tell ourselves and any perceived meanings or definitions is what causes us suffering.

They don‚Äôt actually exist except in our heads.

Our environment isn‚Äôt screaming out how true our thoughts are, your ceiling isn‚Äôt yelling out ‚ÄúYeah! That‚Äôs right! That‚Äôs exactly what this means!‚Äù

They will never paint onto us a story, we can only paint onto it a story or narrative.

When we throw the metaphorical bucket of water (awareness/presence) onto experience‚Äîthe story washes away and what‚Äôs left is bliss.

Each moment we can choose to focus and emphasize the fireworks (experiences) or the night sky (presence/awareness).

I recommend choosing to focus on the night sky, especially if you‚Äôre dealing with something extremely negative, intense or uncomfortable.

3. Don‚Äôt bash yourself for ‚Äúgetting it‚Äù and ‚Äúlosing it‚Äù or having clarity and losing clarity, or being enlightened and being unconsciousness.

Realize that you‚Äôre not supposed to know the entirety of existence or infinity because it‚Äôs typically not relevant to your Human experience.

You are a Human being AND infinity itself.

However, you came here for a purpose: to expand creation in a unique and individualized way that has never before been seen or created.

It would be useless to realize yourself at your highest level at all times and ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù yourself there in that omniscient state of all knowingness permanently because your purpose for creating this unique expression of yourself (Human being) would then be rendered void.

Your purpose is to live your life in the most loving and exciting way possible.

Following your inspiration and enjoying your life.

Listening to your heart‚Äôs desires and passions.

There would be no point for you (infinity) to experience infinity (on THAT level) because it already does that on its own level of existence.

It would defeat the whole purpose of being a Human being, which is to experience the infinite ways infinity exists through your unique point of view, through your unique expression.

And furthermore, honoring this ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù part of yourself, which is actually never unconscious, is extremely important and valid because it‚Äôs the whole reason that you‚Äôre a Human being (and it too is made up of presence/awareness).

A secretary and a CEO can‚Äôt both have the same position at a company, if everyone became the CEO‚Äîthe entire organization would fall apart.

Each part of you has a divine purpose.

You don‚Äôt have to become enlightened and exist 24/7 in infinity because a part of you already does that.

Your purpose is to be yourself naturally and fully.

Your purpose is to love yourself and listen to your heart and trust yourself.

Your purpose is to realize your higher self is ALWAYS taking care of you and guiding you through your excitement, inspiration and passions.

And finally, you never stop being present.

If we revisit any ‚Äúnegative experience‚Äù in your life where you were unconscious or bad or didn‚Äôt do the right thing or were short tempered or something bad happened to you or something else‚Äîa deeper part of you was indeed present and aware of everything that was happening and taking place in that moment.

You didn‚Äôt stop existing in that moment.

Your awareness of the fact you were existing didn‚Äôt vanish.

Your awareness that you were being ‚Äúbad‚Äù or this experience was happening didn‚Äôt vanish.

You were existing long before whatever experience you were having happened.

See?

You‚Äôre always already present.

And even when you‚Äôre unconscious, you‚Äôre still present on a deeper level‚Äîyou‚Äôre always aware of everything that‚Äôs happening.

That‚Äôs your divinity, your eternal nature.

Honor, respect and be grateful for that unconsciousness which helps you in so many ways to learn valuable mistakes, grow and thrive as a Human being.

You‚Äôre not here to be perfect, you‚Äôre here to be you.

So please love yourself, please integrate these valuable lessons and please stop judging yourself for being present or not.

Start embracing your life fully and fearlessly.

Start acting on your passions and excitement.

spirituality,How To Use The Law of Attraction in 4 Steps,"**We become what we think.**

**We think in words and we live our life by those words.**

If you think negative thoughts all the time, then your whole life will turn negative.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs critical that you change all of your negative thoughts to positive thoughts.

If you observe negative people you will soon realize that almost all of the words that come from their mouths are negative.

That means they think negative words constantly. They feel bad because they are constantly negative.

Even if they try to do something positive, things just always tend to turn out negative for them.

That‚Äôs why you must start thinking positive thoughts if you want to start attracting positive things.

That‚Äôs how the law of attraction works or at least that how it has always worked for me.

I can‚Äôt and I won‚Äôt teach you things that I have not personally used.

I can only tell how the law of attraction has worked for me and I hope you can **implement my success into your life.**

**Here is how I have used the law of attraction to attract more health, wealth, love and happiness into my life‚Ä¶**

**STEP 1**

The first thing I did was I stopped listening to the news. The majority of the news is almost always negative.

Humans are drawn to negativity because when we evolved we had to pay attention to all the bad and negative things so we wouldn‚Äôt die.

For example, if someone had died after eating a berry, we had to know what happened so we wouldn‚Äôt make the same mistake.

The news channels feed off our negativity bias because they know that they will get more eyeballs with negativity.

They don‚Äôt care how negative thinking destroys our dreams and hopes. They just want the money.

**STEP 2**

The second thing I did was I Googled photos of my goals and printed them on my wall.

For example, I printed a picture of my soulmate. It took one year to manifest my soulmate and she looked exactly the same as in the photo that I used to manifest her.

In the picture that I printed, my soulmate had brown hair and she was standing in front of a bookshelf.

Well, my soulmate has brown hair and she has a lot of bookshelves in her home.

I also imagined that my soulmate would be Sagittarius or Leo because I‚Äôm Aquarius and I get really well with those two horoscopes.

Well, it turns out that my soulmate is Sagittarius‚Ä¶

**STEP 3**

The next thing I did was write down my goals.

**Writing down your goals is incredibly powerful‚Ä¶**

The idea is that you write down all of your goals as precisely as you can.

You have to be incredibly precise because if you are not precise, then you will attract random things into your life.

For example, I imagined my soulmate in front of a bookshelf because I like reading science books and I would like to discuss and read science books with my soulmate.

But I never wrote down what kind of books my soulmate liked to read, I just wrote that she likes to read.

So it turns out that she reads a lot of manga, not science books!

If you want something specific, be really specific!

**STEP 4**

After completing all the steps the last thing I did was believe.

**This final step is crucial.**

You have to believe that you are going to live your dream life.

The world will try to test you but you must not give up.

You have to keep believing because that is the only way.

You have to take a leap of fate.

I hope that my story and these tips will inspire you to take action!

spirituality,We're taught to be false.,"From the beginning we're taught a certain etiquette.

""Don't say that, that's impolite."" ""Don't do that, that's rude."" 

We're taught a compassion that doesn't arise from us... we're taught to fake it.  ""Love thy neighbor"". 

We're taught to be productive and competitive.  ""Don't be lazy, you'll need to get a good job.  Don't be a painter.  Don't be a poet.  Don't meditate.""

We're taught that our emotions are wrong.  ""Man up!  Don't cry!""  ""Anger?  That's a sin!"" ""Joy?  That's mania, that's ego!""

We're taught that closeness is wrong.  ""No sex before marriage.""  Or on the opposite extreme, ""Sex and only sex, never let anyone get close!""

We're taught to wear a mask, all in the name of some silly etiquette based on fear.  For generations and generations we've been acting this way, and what have we achieved?  Nothing!  Just misery and more misery.

It's no wonder we're so wounded.  From day 1 we are denied the unconditional love that we so desperately need.  We are taught to condemn ourselves, to hate ourselves, to constantly strive to do better.  

But once we start learning to be natural again, then the grieving process begins.  Then healing begins.

And then we can love.  Because you can't love that which is false.  Sometimes the truth is uncertain, uncomfortable, and even frightening... but it is the truth.  

And the truth of our existence, of this human experience is so deeply beautiful.  When I see the fragility of it all, when I see that my life is just a blink in existence... yet here I am anyway - living, loving, rejoicing...  it moves me deeply.

spirituality,I don't look at people the same way anymore,"I went to India in February just after my girlfriend broke up with me. Finally realized I had to look inwards not at outer factors for reasons I ended up in misery all the time. I don't know why I wanted so badly to go to India, I never ever thought of it before. But it was a great move, no doubt.

The trip inwards however started for real when I arrived home. Things I cannot explain happened in India that made me realize things. It almost happened over night and after it happened I came to understanding with so many things. Not intellectual but on a deeper level. My body, mind and soul is in harmony and I feel home wherever I am. 

I don't look at life, myself or others the same way as before. All the anxiety and depression is gone and if I feel anxiety is on its raise I take a deep breath and it fades away (I can almost see it). I have stop taking medication, eg. Valium after years of use. I don't take problems so dead serious anymore and think alot more rational.

When it comes to people I see through their masks. I can see every part of the ego and how its struggling. I see when people get mad and how their face expression changes when someone offends them. I don't see people as thier masks because it is just that, a mask. Instead I feel their true self, a vibrating energy of light. And we are all the same, everyone is equal.

I cannot get angry at the same way anymore at people (or myself). I had quite of a temper but it's gone and I just smile inside me at the whole drama. A smile of love and compassion. Sometimes (rarely) when I am not centered I get angry but I soon gather myself and become grounded and happy again. All of this has changed my relationships with people. Some couldn't continue, but most has become so much better and deeper. I have so much fun now now with my friends and I feel that that is really the meaning of it all.

Also, I don't look so much at the physical apparence anymore. It's not relevant, because it is in fact just a temporary vessel. Instead I see the inner beauty, beyond the mask. This means I don't see people in a sexual way anymore, at least not as much as before. It's not a problem at all however. In fact it's a blessing and my life is so much easier now. But for sure it has changed.

So many other things has changed too. I naturally stopped drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes and so forth. My creativity has increased massivly. I have for sure become alot more interested in spiruality, and finally I understand books at a deep level (eg. Be here now by Ram Dass). People with the same interest pop up in my life and it's like life is telling me to walk this path. 

I don't talk about this with people other than some friends who understand. I don't want to identify myself as a spiritual person either, because it's a trap of the ego and can easily become an attachment as anything else.

During the end of the session I spoke of a voice that I heard clear as day when I was 17. After mentioning the three words that were said to me the medium told me that sometimes he can feel the presence of a guide. He told me my guide stepped in. As his eyes were closed and he was channeling my guide, my guide started telling me, ""You've heard of the heavens right? Well imagine yourself beyond the heavens."" He started talking about how I had been beyond the heavens which didn't make sense at the time. I always thought heaven was at the tip top of the scale. After I saw this medium I began to ask more questions and came across that I've been to the seventh dimension and that a lot of us had. The strangest thing was that I did all of this before I even knew there were 12 dimensions of consciousness. The 3rd was us, the 4th seemed like a transitional dimension(possibly right on par with astral projection), the description of the 5th dimension clicked as heaven with me, and then when I got to the 7th dimension I read about planetary mission work. It also clicked with me as reincarnation. At the 7th dimension we travel to help raise the consciousness of a planet in the body of the species we are trying to help. All the sudden the beyond made sense to me. My spirit guide knew that it would be understood later. Does this resonate with anyone?",1580321918.0

spirituality,‚ÄúDon't spend all of your time trying to FIND yourself. Spend your time CREATING yourself into a person that you'll be proud of.‚Äù -Sonya Parker,"I‚Äôve noticed that recently there seems to be a bit of heaviness in the air lately, and whether that be because of astrological shifts or even sifts in collective human consciousness, I wanted to reach out to those of you that may be¬†¬†little dragged down by it to remember that you are not alone. There is balance in every aspect of life, and right now it seems that we are all in some sort of valley rather than at a high point, but this too shall pass and I believe that a beautiful transformation for humanity is just around the corner. It is up to each of us to determine how we will take upon these transformations ourselves. 

This sort of heavy energy to me signifies the need to purge out habits, thoughts, and situations that no longer serve us. I believe that we as a collective have the power to create an entirely new reality and further move into an entirely new timeline as long as we remain open to these changes, and let ourselves truly come out of our cocoons, as cosmic butterflies who have found their purpose, and pursue it. Our purpose in life is to find our purpose, and I want to encourage everyone who may be reading this to remember how incredibly unique and special you are. You have a unique set of talents and drives that make you you. So embrace them, and let the song within you be heard.

If you are looking for a bit of inspiration today, and a reminder that you are not alone, check out my most recent video. It is hard to show myself to the world in such a raw state, but I want to share my honest, and unfiltered thoughts with anyone who is open enough to hear it. You are incredible and you are loved my friend!!

As well as spreading harmful beliefs. I am very tired of seeing this on Reddit, Instagram, etc. If you are an empath you have the right to find someone who LOVES you, SUPPORTS you, and is not codependent on you. You deserve a happy relationship where someone cherishes you AND your empathy gift. Please do not feel responsible for other wounds/trauma as it is our own job to heal our own wounds!

There's a part of me that is totally on board with all of this. Knows that we are stepping into the truth collectively and it is fucking beautiful. Shifting from 3D restrictions to 5D. This reality's gonna be becoming less and less dense. You know the drill. Shit's awesome.

spirituality,Don‚Äôt fear death,"When you die your ‚Äúessence‚Äù departs the physical and material world we inhabit and returns to its source. Most people fear this change in state because they don‚Äôt understand it. Religions disagree, science hasn‚Äôt been able to conclusively prove anything about where we go, and cultures often speak of death and afterlife in different languages and traditions that fall within a very narrow and sometimes problematic scope of understanding. The best language to explain the mystery surrounding death (and that of the wild human experience too) hasn‚Äôt been invented yet, or if it has, isn‚Äôt commonly understood. Words will never do it justice, but I‚Äôll do my best. 

You are a spiritual being having a human experience. You are a conscious being endowed with the same energy that animates everything around you. You are not simply a five sensory being like you have been taught, you are multisensory, and have more power within you than the people in power can afford for you to believe. 

You‚Äôre here to grow and become aware that you live in a zone of free-will, co-creating with a conscious universe full of diverse life and experience. Everything is connected and everything comes from the same source. The nature of a bipolar reality tricks us into believing in a nature of separation. You are you and I am me, clearly we are different, right? Wrong. In death, if you haven‚Äôt yet learned it in life, you‚Äôll see how we are all expressions of the One, each experiencing life from a different locality, forgetting our source, so that we may one day remember and laugh at how convinced we were that we are alone. It‚Äôs all a dream. 

Your belief system helps manifest the reality that you exist in. As your belief system changes and evolves during your lifetime, so do your experiences. When you die, you leave this physical realm and suddenly gain access to the stream of divine intelligence that you might have felt cut off from as a human. That‚Äôs normal. The ego is naturally skeptical of things it can‚Äôt see or touch because it‚Äôs main focus is survival. It is the most primal urge that allows us to exist and survive on a planet such as Earth, full of danger and uncertainty. To understand death for what it really is, to have reverence for it, would mean accepting it... and the ego fears that above anything else. So we distance ourselves from it, and naturally we fear it. Fear cuts you off from the stream of divine intelligence. 
But I can confirm from personal experience what happens when you die because it‚Äôs happened to me twice. 

You return home. You realize that this life was like a dream, and that you have lived many. In each life learning different lessons and achieving different goals towards your evolution, resolving karma, closing and opening cycles and participating in the great playground of creation. You return to be with those you love, rejoicing in knowing that ‚Äúdeath‚Äù is not a destination, merely a door you pass through to get back to where you once were and where you‚Äôre going next. You realize the physical body is merely a vehicle for the intangible spirit to have the ability to feel, express, believe, create and act. It is not you. The real you is so magnificently complex and infinite that it could not possibly fit into a single name or personality such as we try and do here.  
You realize time is a creative concept that reinforces the ego‚Äôs idea of what life is and how it‚Äôs supposed to be. Human time in its linear expression is limiting and localizing. While it allows us to coexist in an organized way in this dimension, it puts us in a box. And conveniently makes us believe that you can‚Äôt move forward or backward in time matrix. (You can)

You realize love is the most powerful force in existence, and the secret to the manifestation and expression of all that is. Sounds corny, but it‚Äôs true. You realize everything that is and ever was and ever will be and you feel at peace. 

You have this one human life to learn and live as much as you can. So don‚Äôt fear death. Befriend it. You‚Äôre lucky to be here and this human experience is one that is highly sought after by spirit. Fear will keep you prisoner, it will reinforce your suffering and keep you from realizing your true purpose on this planet. 

It‚Äôs time to wake up. Things are moving rapidly and great change is coming. Many people will see these changes and respond with more fear. I‚Äôm simply here to remind you that death is merely one step of the journey and you have nothing to fear. So don‚Äôt spend the rest of your journey worried about it. Live now and don‚Äôt forget the most crucial part and the hardest to remember in this big, messy world sometimes: Love. üíï",1570477989.0

spirituality,Reality is real.,"Life is not a simulation.  You can't wish your way out of a bad situation.  Bad things do happen sometimes, and people suffer greatly.

All this talk of ""you create your reality"" has been very much understood by many people.  Especially those who claim to be spiritual.  

It's true, if you have a positive mindset, if you choose to find beauty in life despite the hardship, then it's true that you will create a sort of better reality for yourself.  But there's no hocus pocus about it.  Dr. Viktor Frankl, a Jewish psychologist, choose to remain hopeful despite being a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp.  He survived.  The prisoners who did not remain hopeful were the first to die.  

In that sense Dr. Frankl choose his reality, yes, it's true.  But he could not ""manifest"" his way out of the concentration camp, just like a starving child can't manifest food, or a cancer patient can't wish his cancer away.  It doesn't work like that.

It's a shame that people think this way, because it doesn't make life more beautiful, it makes it less beautiful.  It makes it all very shallow.  Imagine if your loved one is dieing of cancer... Are you just gonna look at him and say ""it's ok, it's a simulation""?  Or are you going to mourn the loss and enjoy your last moments together?  You know, appreciate the full beauty of the *human* experience.

I don't know about you, but the latter sounds much more beautiful and deep to me.  Much more agonizing too, yes.  But the true beauty of life is found in the fragility, insecurity, and even the suffering. The fact that we are so fragile is the very thing that makes life so precious.

But because it can be difficult to look at people go on telling stories about reality, in order to avoid these painful truths.

It's not necessary.  And true spirituality, true beauty, and true love are never, never found by bypassing reality... they are found by embracing it deeply.",1595490574.0
spirituality,Privilege in Spirituality?,"I recently spoke with a spiritual friend about the protests. She mentioned that I need not be upset, because it was all part of the divine plan, that we're in the midst of a great &amp; uncomfortable awakening, and would work itself out as intended.

I argued that we need to take action in order for oppression and brutality to end.

She took it to a higher spiritual discussion that there isn't really ""oppression"" - just the illusion of oppression here on Earth - and that we are all actually just made of light, existing here in a human illusion.

Something about this really messed with my spiritual beliefs. Before all of this, I would have agreed 100%. But now, I feel it takes a certain amount of privilege to sit there and believe ""This is the divine plan, it's an illusion, we are all just love and light"" when innocent people are being murdered.

Many people do not have this luxury. Even if we are in an ""illusion"", many people are living an ""illusion"" that is implicitly more dangerous and more violent. I would imagine it's much harder to meditate on visions of infinite light &amp; peace, when you're worried about getting killed for standing the wrong way outside a store.

What if my spiritual perspective has been wrong all along? It's hard for me to think George Floyd is a spirit who ""chose"" to enter this earth to get murdered for 8 minutes through painful suffocation. Or that Floyd's mother is a spirit who ""chose"" to take the human experience of having her son senselessly murdered.

It was easier for me to tackle my own victim mentality when I believed I was a spirit who ""chose"" this human experience, but that was around my own issues with relationships or family or codependency. When it comes to innocent people being murdered for the color of their skin, it seems absolutely delusional to apply the same beliefs.

spirituality,Mass awakenings bringing onslaught of negativity and toxicity to the surface.,"If you‚Äôre channeling a dark night of the soul, or an existential crisis, or a serious bout of depression and change of personality or character, it‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre going through a spiritual awakening.  I am not a clinical psychotherapist so please don‚Äôt weigh in if you need professional help.

After coming out of mine, I can offer this:

Resistance comes in tricky forms:  like waiting, doubting, repressing, over-seeking and neglecting the root issues that come up.

You may be feeling too weak, or unstable, or tired/lethargic, or deeply hurt to ‚Äúheal‚Äù or ‚Äúdo the work‚Äù and that‚Äôs the first response‚Äî and the start of many responses for a very long time.

Your soul is seeking a revolution and resolution from lessons not learned, a non conducive lifestyle and/or relationship, a dead end job or mission/purpose, or at its core, a dishonesty of self that blocks love to emanate and disseminate from your hearts center.

The negativity that festers is what will rot your progress for your awakening that trust me, the awakening is the pot of gold at the end of a shitty rainbow and rainy season.

Every day is an opportunity to practice courage and bravery.  Practicing to listen to your internal guidance void of ego, super ego and victimization.

If you‚Äôre in a safe place of home, remember that you have all the basics needed to persevere and DO.

If you‚Äôre in an unsafe space.  Move.  Move home.  Move with a family member, get out.

I made a conscious move that set the stage of my dark night for 12m.  And each day was a combination of trying, fetal positions, ‚ÄúI cants‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy me‚Äôs‚Äù, not crying, and eventually lots of crying.  And finally, a call to action to birth a new me after killing the old me.

You don‚Äôt have to feel stuck everyday.  DM me if you would like to share your experiences.

spirituality,June 5th world wide spells/rituals/etc.,"Hello! I'm hoping to get this message to as many people as I can, and while I don't have any large followings anywhere. I figure I can reach out to people and organizations individually.

Tomorrow during the full moon, Pagans/Witches/people of all different paths will be doing various rituals, spells, and  just sending out good thoughts and energies to help with the protests going on around the world. Things were brought on by the unfortunate and inexcusable murder of George Floyd. from what I understand, most will be focusing on protection, health, and a positive and peaceful outcome. However, as is with most pagan practices your choices are always your own!

spirituality,Albert Einstein on what makes a genuine Scientist,"""The basic laws of the universe are simple, but because our senses are limited, we can‚Äôt grasp them. There is a pattern in creation. If we look at this tree outside whose roots search beneath the pavement for water, or a flower which sends its sweet smell to the pollinating bees, or even our own selves and the inner forces that drive us to act, we can see that we all dance to a mysterious tune, and the piper who plays this melody from an inscrutable distance‚Äîwhatever name we give him‚ÄîCreative Force, or God‚Äîescapes all book knowledge...

I like to experience the universe as one harmonious whole. Every cell has life. Matter, too, has life; it is energy solidified. The tree outside is life, a statue is dead. The whole of Nature is life, and life, as I observe it, rejects a God resembling man.. \[A cosmic religion\] has no dogma other than teaching man that the universe is rational and that his highest destiny is to ponder it and co-create with its laws.

The genuine scientist is not moved by praise or blame, nor does he preach. He unveils the universe and people come eagerly, without being pushed, to behold a new revelation: the order, the harmony, the magnificence of creation! And as man becomes conscious of the stupendous laws that govern the universe in perfect harmony, he begins to realize how small he is. He sees the pettiness of human existence, with its ambitions and intrigues, its ‚ÄòI am better than thou‚Äô creed..""

spirituality,Coronavirus; How you can approach these chaotic times.,"Hi friends!

I hope you're keeping well. I don't usually come here, but this felt like a good forum to just share some tips on how you can orient yourself around the chaos of these times. I hope this finds anyone who needs to hear this.

# Humanity has an opportunity to shift, and evolve into a higher version of ourselves. This includes you.

This coronavirus chaos is *polarizing*. Some people are going to use it to move deeply into doomsday scenarios, paranoia, blame, judgment, xenophobia,  and aggression. They will be moving psychologically backward.

There will be some people who will refuse to engage. They'll hoard resoures, hole up at home, hold their breath, brace themselves to just wait and *just get through all of it*, and come out unchanged.

But then there are people like you and I who have the chance to *stay grounded, stay sane, and breathe through this whole experience.* We're keeping our wits about us. We're staying mentally online. We're being smart about what we do, but we're remembering to smile and relax.

When we stay present and grounded through this, then we allow fear to arise and complete itself without getting mentally caught up in it. We allow it to be processed as an energetic experience, instead of staying locked up in our minds.

This is how we evolve as people.

Many of us will be evolving rapidly in these times.

# Remember the Now; Dwell in the Now

This will sound weird, but follow me here:

Remember that there's only the now-moment. Everything that has ever happened, happened in the Now. Anything that *will* happen will happen in the Now. The Now is all there is. A still, vast, wide arena in which all of this drama is playing itself out.

All of our wars, famines, diseases, disasters have all played out in the Now. The Now itself is indestructible, just as silence itself cannot be destroyed.

Ground yourself in the Now. Observe the Now in which all the chaos is playing itself out. Let everything arise that's arising, let everything go that's going. Witness all of it without judgement, just pure acceptance.

As this happens, choose what actions you'll take and take them. But drop all negativity about it. Your negativity is not useful now.

# Keep your humor about you!

See if you can remember laughter throughout this whole thing!

See if you can have some fun. What opportunities do you have now if you're staying inside to isolate yourself? Let's turn this into the world's biggest sleepover!

# Stay with your breath

When all else fails, just breathe slowly through your experience. Nice deep breaths. I sincerely believe that all is well and will continue to be well.

All the best!

spirituality,Beautiful higher self experience,"Last night had a great experience. 1 month sober and decided to hit some thc and meditate on the full moon. As soon as my brain was hit my consciousness shifted. In 3-5 minutes I was thinking and forming thoughts in such a beautiful way. Everything was laid out so perfectly, the flow was insane. As my consciousness was more aware I got clear answers on what affects me when I‚Äôm not aware. Big one I pulled out was the phone, as soon as I partook in tasks on my phone such as scrolling through social media I could directly tell how it disrupts flow. A distraction if will. I literally could tell my energy being drained from focusing on other people instead of myself. The higher self really knows all. There really is levels to this shitttt.

spirituality,Love yourself just a little bit more today!,"Today you may find yourself becoming a bit self critical. This is not the time to go down into an emotional spiral. If you were your best friend (and by the way, you should be), what would you say to you? How would you treat you? 

Its challenging, dealing with so much going on. Fears sometimes turn to anger, then depression. Try to continually monitor your feelings with a goal of emotional neutrality. 

Yes mercury is in retrograde so technology is challenging, but the other thing about mercury in retrograde as it brings up things that we thought we had handled and emotionally processed that we clearly have not. Stuff we shoved in the shadows internally starts popping back up again. I used to fear mercury in retrograde and I have found that now that I actually embrace it and recognize it for the gift that it is. I find the technology issues aren‚Äôt as stressful as they used to be. They  pop up and then they go away. But the spiritual insight that we gain from these times, seeing those things in ourselves that we didn‚Äôt want to look at that we really need to address that‚Äôs a gift that can last the rest of our life.

So love yourself just a bit more today. You deserve it!

spirituality,I Met my higherself and she gave me life changing advice,"I did a meditation last night and it was intense had me crying. It was about meeting my higher self. She was beautiful- Godess Like- and was pure love. Now that I am reconnected with her I feel a sense of purpose again. Her message to me was to GIVE LOVE to myself and to others and to let go of those lower concious feelings. Also that when anybody feels fear of being alone what you are really feeling is fear of not being loved, therefore you must give love. She had the most nurturing, loving look  in her eye like, I've never had anyone look at me like that with exception of my partner- but it made me feel like I am not a bad person and that I deserve to live this life to the max. I guess I never knew how much we sabotage ourselves by Withholding love, which is what we are all made of, let's start asking ourselves each morning how can I give love today?üíú‚ù§ Also we need to remember to connect with our higherself on a regular basis in order to keep them near. Just like any other relationships we have, we can't expect someone to be there for us if we never talk to them right?  Also I did sense some sadness in my higher self like why haven't I looked for her or tried to connect but still had an overwhelming sense of understanding and unconditional love. She asked me to seek her out and she would be there for me and before leaving told me to smile and just have fun with this lifetime! So the message is: Give love every day and you will have a purposeful life! Seek your higherself regularly to establish a strong relationship and have fun!",1562355285.0
spirituality,I'm just a guy and there's no need to bully myself into doing better. You can just be a human.,"(**Edit:** If this is too long, too fuckin bad.  Have a lovely day! &lt;3)

Everyone seems to have their opinion on things.  And people are so god-damn sure that they're right about it!  Not only sure for themselves, which TBH I'm skeptical of, but sure *for everybody else,* too.  As in, ""this is what works for me, so it must work for you, too"".  How in the world could they know?

It comes in varying degrees.  Some people are really pushy... take your typical Mormons or Jehova's witnesses.  Then there are people who are less pushy, but still pushy.  Think the people who give you unsolicited advice.  Then there are people who give you advice when asked for, but in a sort of commanding and not understanding way.  IMO the best teachers / advice-givers are the ones who can say ""This is just my experience.  Your way may be different.""

Not that they have to do it after every sentence.  But at the end of the day, the underlying message is that.

But apart from that, apart from sharing...  How in the world is that everybody seems *so god-damn sure* *of themselves* in the first place?  No, me, I'm not sure of myself.  I doubt.  I get frustrated.  I seek answers.  I get confused.  I wonder if it's all even fucking worth it.

But everywhere you go everyone is so damn sure of themselves.  People speak with such certainty on this sub, and all over the internet.  People send me videos about self-improvement, about tantra, they talk to me about Buddhism.  And they're so god-damn sure about it!  I almost wanna say, hey, do you have bad days?  Does this really work for you?  Are you *truly* happy deep down?  Tell me!  Please! Tell me! Because I'm skeptical!  I'm skeptical that everyone can be so god-damn certain... there's no way!  It must be hiding something!

Tell me your honest inner experience!

I'm not saying there aren't people who have attained a great deal or even absolute peace.  I'm sure there are.  But I feel like it's a minority.  And I feel like they can give hints, but they can't walk for you.  Every individual is so different!  And whatever change happens cannot be *philosophical*, it must be rooted in reality.  Knowledge is not enough. The path has to be *walked.*  And nobody can walk it for you.

All I know is what's working for me is just letting myself *be who I am.*  Without any ideals, goals, advice, or outside knowledge.  Sure, a lot of people have helped me out along the way.  And I'm grateful for that.  But in the end all the walking has been done by me... what is real is not what I read in some book, or what some guy told me on the internet.  **What is real is what I have done, acted upon... things that have felt right, things that have ""clicked"", and forever changed me deep down.**  There is no substitute for cold, hard experience.

And, because of everything I talked about above, I'm not afraid to be lost.  I'm not afraid to have moments where I feel down... frustrated... anxious... confused... afraid.  It's just human.  It gets better, it does get better.  That's been my experience.  But I think it gets better the more that we accept it.  Not fight it.  Fighting it makes it worse.

That's why I don't like people giving me unsolicited advice.  Because it's like they're trying to give me an ideal.  It's like it's not OK just to be a human fucking being.  It's not acceptance, it's rejection.  It's condemnation.  It's hate parading under beautiful words (""self-improvement"", ""be your best self"", ""enlightenment"", ""the way of peace"", IDK... choose your own fuckin' term, there's lots of them).

I'm just a guy.   I don't need to bully myself into being anything more than I am.  It's OK just to be me.

And it's OK just to enjoy the small things in life, too.  There's no destination, folks.  This moment could be our last.  So enjoy the little things.  In the end it's all we're gonna have.

You can do what you want, but as for me, I'm not listening to the people who are constantly urging me to do better.  I'm fucking tired of trying to do better.

And it's not some victimhood shit.  I believe we can change, I believe in a better life... I believe we can suffer less than we do.

But the way we do that, at least the way that works for me, is to stop being so damn hard on myself.  Just let me be the guy that I am.  Relax.  Love myself more.  Take it easy.  Enjoy the little things.  Have sex.  Fall in love.  Let myself have a bad day sometimes.  It's OK.

And somehow life becomes a little more peaceful, a little more joyful.

And that's really fuckin' cool.",1586644500.0

spirituality,"‚ÄúYou are loved just for being who you are, just for existing. You don‚Äôt have to do anything to earn it....No one can take this love away from you, and it will always be here.‚Äù - Baba Ram Dass","Love is a high vibration. When we learn to love ourselves wholly and completely, for our light and our shadow, we open up our hearts to love others even more. 

It is so much easier for us to love than it is to hate. When we hold resentment against ourselves and others, we may experience that resentment as negativity in our outward reality, or even develop health problems within. If we resonate at the love frequency and learn to observe without judgement, we actually attract that same energy into our lives, inside and out. 

Put on your love goggles today, and tell the ones you care about how much you love them. Forgive yourself for mistakes you‚Äôve made, and let go of the grudges you‚Äôre holding against others that are only robbing you of energy and life. Allow yourself to fall back in love with life again, and accept all the goodness that it will bring you because it‚Äôs loving you back. (:

That superpower, my friends, is called **the power of sharing what you know (with the world at large).**  

Many have already seen this power in action countless times already, that too, on *this very platform no less.* All people who have spent a fair amount of time on here have *already witnessed* as to how just one person sharing their life experiences and learnings can help **SO MANY OTHERS** find a guiding path **TOWARDS THE LIGHT.** 

Believe it or not, a life experience or anecdote that might take you *but 5 minutes to type out in a comment box* can prevent a depressed someone from *taking their very life.* A (seemingly) *""simple""* life lesson that you learned in your own life could turn out to be that *one-missing-piece-of-the-puzzle* that shifts someone from poverty to abundance, or hatred to **LOVE.** **Many upon this world** ***still have*** **NO IDEA as to how INCREDIBLY POWERFUL their words, experiences, stories, learnings or even their** ***anecdotes*** **are or could really BE (to someone else sitting on** ***another distant*** ***corner*** **of the planet no less).**  

I so often get comments on my threads mocking me for *""why do you keep writing these long ass posts""* or stuff like *""it's the internet why do you care so much""* and stuff like that; at times, even in my inbox no less. But ALL OF THAT BECOMES *UTTERLY MEANINGLESS* when even just **ONE LONE PERSON** sends me a heartfelt message of thanks to my inbox as to how one of my posts or comments literally pulled them out of the very jaws of death, hopelessness, or on smaller levels, solved a huge (or small) life problem that they were currently dealing with. And that, *in itself,* is my ""grand payoff."" Because, like it or not my friends, but **plenty of the people on** ***""the internet""*** **are VERY REAL human beings such as you and me.** And I'm *very, VERY sure* that many others who have posted posts / comments that have assisted someone else in their greatest time of need can vouch for what I am saying here. And so can they tell you all of the sheer ***JOY*** that comes with being able to bring light, love or *HOPE* into someone's life or world. I'm *anyways* not the only one who does this on here (or elsewhere) in any case.  

So, what can you do about all of this *tangibly?* Well, for one thing, you all can start SHARING. **RIGHT. FROM. THIS. MOMENT. (and onward).** SPEAK UP about your experiences. DARE TO BE VULNERABLE about how you overcame depression, or addiction, or suicidal tendencies, or a heartbreak, or *what-have-you.* It doesn't even always have to be a *huge and grandiose thing* you know -- you could even share a *cooking hack* with the rest of the world out there and STILL find a way to help someone in need you know. For **YOU** can never really know (or be able to tell) whether what you have to share with the world is going to ""benefit"" someone or not, so stop worrying so much about it and share *generously* (like only YOU ever really can). All that matters in the end is whether your **intention** comes from a good, benevolent and *beneficial-to-all* place in your heart, does it not?  

For instance, if you've overcome anxiety, TRUST that there must be, *at the very least,* ***AT LEAST 10 OTHER PEOPLE*** (within, say, a 1,000+ member subreddit alone) who are currently being challenged by *that exact same problem.* Same with the fear of public speaking, or say, addiction. Now, even if your words of inspiration / wisdom / experience are able to assist BUT ONE PERSON UPON THIS PLANET, that is still **ONE MORE HAPPIER PERSON** upon this beautiful world of ours. And believe it or not, **ASSISTING EVEN ONE PERSON EQUALS ASSISTING THE ENTIRE WORLD.** How? *Allow me to explain.*  

Imagine a massive dark room filled with un-lit, living, breathing and walking *candles.* There's no hope, light, or *direction* in this dark, dead room. Everyone's constantly stumbling, falling, collapsing, or *dying.* And then, one day, one candle, **just one lone candle dear folks,** dares to ***light itself up.*** It does so by pushing past ALL of its vulnerabilities, and by going against ALL of the established norms, ways, rules and regulations set upon this *dark and dreary world.* But ***it doesn't care.*** For it simply **KNOWS** that it **HAS TO** express itself now, for it is indeed, **NOW OR NEVER** for it now.  

As soon as this *one single lone candle* lights up, suddenly, the ENTIRE ROOM is filled with LIGHT. Because **THAT'S HOW POWERFUL LIGHT REALLY IS.** Sure, the light isn't *all that much,* but hey, at least it's *there* now! Candles closest to the lit candle are now *affected* by this light, and so are many more others *far off* in the distance. The light then begins to spread, albeit slowly. And then, another candle connects with the first candle and lights up. One candle now becomes *two candles.* Far off in the distance, some candles get the courage to light up all by themselves. Four candles. Five candles. Six candles. Eight candles. Twelve candles. Eighteen candles. **The light multiplies and continues to multiply, slowly but SURELY.** Eventually, the light begins to grow ***EXPONENTIALLY.*** And at long last, the *ENTIRE ROOM IS LIT.* **ALL BECAUSE** that **ONE LONE CANDLE** dared to **KNOW and SHARE its LIGHT** with the *""rest.""* And that, my friends, is how positive intent starts *infinite chain reactions* that can eventually transform the *entire planet at large.* This is not false optimism. This is a **fact** (and a *most logical one* at that). And if you look at some of the immensely horrible practices and ideas that humanity has abolished permanently (or at least partially) throughout the ages, it is THIS VERY FACTOR that has contributed to it **ALL.** For step-by-step, nudge-by-nudge, we go towards the LIGHT.  

*Far too many people* absolutely REFUSE to SPEAK UP AND SHARE THEIR STORIES out of sheer anxiety or fear of people's judgement. There are people out there (and quite possibly, in here reading this even) who have successfully broken the cycle of abuse or addiction. Many of them are still *silent.* Some have even conquered depression or anxiety. Still *silent.* There's people out there whose lives have been COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED POSITIVELY by spiritual, supernatural, paranormal or extraterrestrial / extradimensional experiences. They're all on mute today because *""what will people think?"".* Don't get me wrong here, I am *SO* ***NOT*** *JUDGING* anyone here (or elsewhere) for being brave (or not) -- but that I simply wish to ask them all *but one simple question here today:* **Would they have STILL remained silent about things if they had KNOWN FOR A FACT that what they had to share could have POTENTIALLY SAVED SOMEONE'S LIFE (or many more!) or even could have POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE ENTIRE WORLD for that matter?** *Every single person reading this* has to ask and answer this question for themselves.  

Our world is currently going through *incredible amounts of purging hidden darkness* (and all of the turbulence that comes with this rather painful exercise). Dark secrets, practices and behaviours of people are being revealed to us *day after day after day.* Barring certain amounts of political games and hidden agendas at play behind some of these things in general, it is, nevertheless, **very much so a FACT (regardless of where you live),** that separation-based concepts such as racism, sexism, casteism, capitalism, and a countless other -isms (and non -isms) exist (and have forever *existed)* within our world that have brought pain and suffering to many. Women have been abused, children have been abused, animals have been abused, plants have been abused, even our very soils, our very waters, and our very *skies* have been abused (and UNFATHOMABLY at that) here. And if **YOU** don't speak up about it to the whole world out there first, then trust me, ***NO ONE ELSE WILL EITHER.*** Because people simply seem to LOVE playing *follow-the-leader* on planet Earth here a tad bit too much, sadly. So you, the lucky one reading this, is going to have to be the one to really be *going in first* in here for making all of this stuff happen, *for the whole world at large to* ***THEN*** *be following along in your footsteps of untold greatness thereon.* **You go** ***FIRST.*** Coz *that's how we roll* on this land, apparently. Well, *so be it then!*  

**YOU** have to be the bold and brave one to start all of these conversations.

spirituality,I feel an intense love for everything and everyone and it's growing stronger every day.,"TL;DR: My spiritual journey over the past 6 months has given me an intense divine love for all the humans and animals of the Earth and the Universe itself. Be grateful for all the things you have because chances are, you are better off than a huge population of the world.

I've only discovered this spiritual path in June 2019. I still have a long way to go but after finding a divine connection with the universe, my life has totally changed.

I'm in a lot of debt, I'm in my third attempt at college but I have a job, food to eat and a loving family and friends. My situation used to make me feel sad and frustrated at myself. But for the past 7 months, I've been at total peace and I accept that I can solve my problems with grace and hard work.

I was never a racist or a hateful person but I have never felt a love for our Earth and all the humans and animals that inhabit it like I do now. I spent my time reading books and meditating to forge my path.

This kind of divine love that I feel is growing stronger and I have never been more happy and peaceful than I am now. I'm excited to know what the future beholds, even if we live in a depressing era of climate change and other problems.

Remember to be grateful for what you have. If you have food, water, shelter, the ability to read and write then you are better off than a huge majority of the world. Even finding gratefulness in these little things can bring you a lot of bliss. And also remember to respect the Earth and it's resources and not go on a path of endless consumption.

I find myself uninterested in news and ideas that divide us as a community. We are one soul and we are children of the universe. Fighting and divisiveness brings us nothing but eternal suffering.

spirituality,My story...,"I didn't realize it at the time, but when I was 8 years old I met my soulmate. I went to my cousins house to play just like always, but this time one of their friends from school was staying the night with them. The moment Dalton met me he knew he loved me. That very night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I didn't say yes or no, but instead spit coke in his face. Safe to say he took that as a no. --------

Fast forward to when I'm 15, a few months from my 16th birthday. I had never been allowed to date or anything of that nature. For some reason I asked my cousin for his friends number. Just to reach out and make a friend I guess. Well one thing led to another and I finally convinced my parents to let me date. My first date was at a local sushi/hibachi restaurant with my parents and little brother with me. After dinner we went to Wal Mart and walked around joking and just having a really good time. We talked nightly and texted almost constantly. He is my first kiss. He is my first love. We wrote love notes to each other and occasionally he would be allowed to come to my house, but I was never allowed to go over to his. My mom was scared I would have sex. --------

On the day of our one year anniversary he couldn't come to my house due to lack of transportation, and said why don't we just hang out at his house. I explained my mothers reasoning and he had some choice words about my mother, but I understood his frustration. My mother a few days later ended up finding the messages and saw what he said. She demanded I break things off with him. She blocked his number and would ground me if I ever messaged him. I did try to message him on multiple occasions, but it always ended up with me getting punished. I was heart broken, but I understood where she was coming from so I simply let it happen. I tried dating two other guys during the next year and both fizzled out mutually. --------

The summer I turned 18 was great. I had my own car and I was staying a few nights with my grandparents since my cousin was in town from Florida. I was excited to spend time with him and a few of his friends I had never met before. He ended up blowing me off and it hurt my feelings. It was like 9pm when I decided I would call Dalton and ask if I could come to his house. After about an hour I finally managed to find his house, it was in the middle of no where. We ended up talking until 6am and enjoying each others company. Many kisses and snuggles were shared that evening. For the next month I was able to sneak around and spend time with Dalton without my mom finding out. When she did find out she kicked me out. Dalton immediately allowed me to move in with him. --------

July 1, 2015. The day he asked me to be his girlfriend. A wonderful date indeed. By our first anniversary I knew he was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. We had our fair share of arguments, but we were always able to come to a compromise and end each night snuggled together and say ""Good night. I love you."" We had many adventures together, too many to name each one in this post. Vacations. Drugs. Date nights. Movies. Games. Sex. We also were building our own family with our many fur babies. A whole lifetime of adventures shoved into 4 and a half years. --------

2019 was our year of grinding. From working two jobs, to both of us getting really good jobs with benefits and awesome pay. We started saving to buy a house in 2020. In October we got our first rental and we were doing really grand. He always made dinner because he wanted to be a chef and own a restaurant one day.  He said that once we get our own house and were married he wanted to go to culinary school. We had goals together and our own individual goals, but we supported each other through what ever life threw at us. --------

November 26, 2019. The day I lost my other half. It was a normal day with plans to make our very own Thanksgiving meal for ourselves the next day. One moment he was telling me to come get him when my show was over and the next I heard a gun shot. He was fooling around and spinning his gun to mess with our room mate. It spun at just the right angle and went off and it was an immediate death. I felt shock and when I finally allowed myself to break down I felt like a large part of me was gone. I remember the entire day from beginning to end in full detail. --------

The first month was a blur. Moved in with my mom, put most of our stuff in storage, went to thanksgiving dinner, had his memorial (which was a lovely event in his honor), christmas, his birthday, new years. In between these events I didn't get off of the couch and ate very little. Always hoping that my death was just right around the corner. In January I met someone on reddit that pointed me in a direction that I needed for spiritual growth and peace. --------

I have grown in ways that previously I didn't even think of. I have reached out to mediums and spiritual advisors. I have left organized religion. I have had contact with Dalton through the veil. Mostly in my dreams or through music. Occasionally I will hear him whisper a word or wake up to the feeling of him kissing me on my forehead. I have started meditating and facing my inner self. I have let go of past grudges and reached out to all I have ever slighted to apologize and try to make up for any pain I cause them. I live each day in the moment and I want to experience life. I want to sky dive. I want to swim with dolphins. I want to travel the world. I want to grow my spiritual abilities and awareness. I want to spread love and happiness to each soul I encounter. I am thankful for the love that we share because it is strong enough to peirce the veil of confusion even only for brief moments. Throughout my life we always found our way back to one another, and I know when my time comes I will be right back in his arms with lots of stories to share. --------

To all that have read this, thank you. I would like you to know that no matter what you are going through or what you have endured that you are loved and you are strong.

spirituality,"Advice to people with ""non-spiritual"" partners","I have been with my bf who's now my fiance' for almost 12 years. However, I became aware of my journey to spirituality later in the relationship. I made a somewhat similar post here 3 days ago. 

So at first it was the loneliest journey mainly because i felt like i cannot talk to him about it. Even if he listened i did not feel heard. I was beginning to feel like he's not ""the one"". But the more I experience things, the more I learn and this is my realization. 

I felt alone because I thought that not having similar beliefs means not loving me enough. When you believe in something, you automatically think it's the universal truth and there's no gray area to things. It's either I am right or wrong or you love me and believe or practice it too or we won't work out. I viewed him as non-spiritual because my idea of spirituality does not resonate with his. He's agnostic and a skeptic. 

But boy he loves me the way i want to be loved (set aside my spiritual preferences). He is good for my sanity. He is responsible. Overall healthy for my being. I also notice one great thing which I have only realized now. He is SO great with animals. He loves them and they adore him too. He asked me one time to not throw the water from the rice cooker while I'm cleaning it to make another pot. He said instead of throwing the little bits of rice left, we could feed it to birds who visit every morning by the window. Birds visit us daily because of this. He feeds feral cats and dogs. Every night he watches videos of animals being rescued and he's so happy. He's a natural carer. He's good with children too. And honestly i am not. I love animals but not really sure how to deal with them. 

So i realized that he's not spiritual in a way that I know but he is spiritual in his own. Your partner may be too. You just have to look past your ego and ideals sometimes so you could see better.

spirituality,"""Are you really just going to do nothing and wait for a miracle?""","I've changed a whole lot over the years but I still get into funks.  And it's weird, but I think the funks are somehow related to the amount that I'm changing.  Back in the day it was just stagnant ""bluh"" but now I feel like it's some sort of reaction to all that's going on with me. It's like the mind desperately trying to fight back before it's too late.

But today was rough, man.  No particular reason.  Just felt crappy and like life sucked and that I'd never get over this crap, and even if I did what would even be the point?  Yeah.  Brutal.  

I kept running in my head possible solutions.  ""Well, there's this teacher.  Maybe I should go back to him."" Or ""maybe I need to do more meditation"" etc. etc.  All sorts of questioning and planning and doubt and confusion.

Somehow though all my planning and scheming felt futile.  I don't want to do anything or change anything, and some part of me feels like that's the right direction.  So as I settled down for a much needed nap today, I had this thought: ""are you really just going to do nothing and wait around for some sort of a miracle?""

And my answer, funnily enough, turned out to be ""yes"".  That's exactly what I'm going to do.  

Because it's paying attention to these thoughts that makes them seem scarier than they are. It's feeding into them that keeps the bicycle pedaling.  Quit pedaling and eventually it all comes crashing down 

So yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Absolutely nothing and wait for a miracle.

Finally I'll just face the funkiness without trying to change it or run away from it.  Let's see what it's all about.  Let's see if it's really as scary as my mind wants to make it out to be.

And somewhere beneath all that I can feel the peace and contentment growing.",1589209091.0
spirituality,Capitalizing on this Supermoon's Energy,"Today is a special day, as many of you are aware of, it's the Supermoon this evening. This is the Full Moon of Aires, and as this moon typically does, it aligns perfectly with the holy week and numerous other planetary changes (Jupiter &amp; Pluto‚Äôs position, balance of sun/earth/moon); which are priming Earth and its inhabitants for a huge wave of energy. 

Now the Full Moon of Aires is directly tied to Christianity, and although I don't personally align with any religion, I do study each to gain the universal wisdom that each contains. This is an incredibly liberating, healing, transformative, and uplifting full moon cycle that represents the holy week and spirituality itself. This full moon can be understood as the moon of Restoration or Resurrection if you prefer that term. And as this too is known as the Pink Supermoon, we must understand that all of these are pointing us towards the unique time that is Spring. Our abilities to heal ourselves are already powerful, but this full moon provides extra juice so we may fully transform ourselves. Like the caterpillar yearning for flight, this is the time where we can collect enough energy, motivation, and confidence to build our chrysalis. It's through this full moon that we can not only heal/transform ourselves, but our planet- and considering everything going on we must see these universal signs of 'ironic timing' (the universe has a great sense of humor) as our time to act. 

Like any opportunity that life offers us, it can go either way. So to ensure you don't end up getting tossed in this wave of vitality coming our way there's a few things you can do to avoid being victim to your own lesser natures and these powerful energies: 

**Ground/Root Yourself:** Take some time by yourself today to simply connect with Earth. Either through the physical act of standing or sitting in the grass/dirt to a more conscious act of meditation while visualizing roots of light extending from your root chakra (base of spine) and extremities. When we ground ourselves, not only does the physical body get cleansed and alleviated, but it cleanses us of negative energy. Our Earth is an amazing healer, as we are since we too are expressions of Earth, these powers combined level you up like Captain Planet, and the healing potential of yourself and Earth are increased. As you receive her love, she receives the negative and transforms it back into positive. See this is the initial clearing the ground/foundation, realignment into love/positivity, in addition to building up protection so you may receive all energies safely and that they may flow into the desired centers for healing.   


**Fix your Attention to a Higher Purpose:** Allow yourself to stay focused on those higher aspirations we have for ourselves (truth, growth, love, inclusivity, openness, etc.) and do everything in your power to explore them. Understand the cause &amp; effects to your changes, the results/impact of not changing, the life experiences that brought you there etc. Most importantly, this is to humble ourselves so the waters of life that we receive don't flow into the paths of least resistance (bad/destructive habits, lesser natures) because then we're getting tossed by the wave, not riding it. 

**Meditate:** Obviously dedicating any time to your own inner-looking will provide the necessary space to explore and consistent nourishing to grow, however this reminder is geared towards a Full Moon Mediation. See this as your 'pranic' (energetic) dinner. This is when you will consciously open yourself up to receive the energies, in addition to consciously leading them into the many centers of the body for assimilation, transmutation, and ultimately transformation. I can't stress this enough, it's incredibly important to meditate when the full moon is actually out, even better at its peak, and even best you're outside with plenty of skin exposed to the moonlight (and your crystals if you're into all that lol). 

I hope these reminders help you during this opportunistic, transformative, and healing time. Now is the time to act, now is the time to heal, now is the time we transform ourselves, our planet, and the future of humanity.

spirituality,"Must Read - How to Get Answers, Solve Problems, and Connect to Higher Powers","There is a method that is documented in books such as the Law of One that I have experimented with over the past year, and I am beginning to realize its power. I want to share it with you all because I believe it is not only a fundamental tool in humanities shift in consciousness, but one of the first tools we must begin using if we are to make this transition.

The method is very simple. When you have a problem, you sit down, try to clear your mind or just breath, then you state the problem either out loud or in your head. Then you wait for an answer. It is important to calm your mind, but at the same time allow thoughts to flow in. Pretend as if you are watching the clouds float by - no need to grasp, but stay alert. One of these clouds is an answer. If you are an experienced meditator, you can simply quiet your mind and wait for the answer to come. Regardless, no need to inspect thoughts too intensely. Let them come naturally.

When an answer comes, and in my experience in comes pretty quick, you will know. The answer will make perfect sense. You will say ""holy crap, I can't believe how easily I solved that!"" You may not have all the answers, but you will know the next step. Your question will have been answered.

I know this may sound bizarre to some of you, but I strongly urge you to give it a try for yourself. I truly believe that this is an extremely powerful tool that we must begin using. We all have problems. We all are trying to figure out our path. This is the answer. I can't speak for everybody, but I do believe that for many, this is the answer (no pun intended).

Take a moment right now to ask yourself what problem is bugging you, then try this method out and share in the comments how it worked for you. I look forward to hearing from you.

I stayed up all night yesterday just to literally out of nowhere be like ‚Äúyou know, i didnt like you as much as you think i did.‚Äù ‚ÄúI was just saying an doing all that stuff to make you feel special. I really actually loved somebody else‚Äù. And that just really made me realize something important...

I already kinda knew all this already deep down inside. Since the start a lot seemed odd about her. And i knew something was up with her. And i just ignored myself because i ‚Äúthought‚Äù she was the one. Which was stupid of me.

If i loved myself none of this would affect me right now. I wouldnt even still be talking to her. I wouldve had higher standards for myself, so I wouldn‚Äôt have even ended up dating her.

So from now on im listening to myself more. Im gonna start having more respect for myself and work towards being the greatest me i could be. :)

spirituality,Start at the root: Your guide to root chakra healing.,"https://www.chakras.info/wp-content/uploads/root-chakra-healing-chart.jpg

#Root Chakra:

Over the next couple weeks, I hope to present the seven major chakras for both education and to maintain my own. This is absolutely a discussion, share your techniques, experiences, and knowledge about the chakras discussed.

I have to be blunt, you don't need to believe any of this to benefit from this work. It's strictly common sense stuff, wellness, quality of life and health.

#Begin always with the root:

In essence, root chakra is centered about physical security, basic needs, and basic health. Other chakras overlap, so don't get too hung up on the details.

It's most important to grounding and centering. Without a strong root, the rest of the chakras will suffer, though it's not impossible to have other strong chakras with a weak root, imagine how strong they could be if you took care of this first. Therefore, root should always be the first considered and maintained.

#Home: 

A warm bed and shelter from the elements is the best you could hope for. Sleeping under a cardboard box, in your car, or with constant fear of eviction are all considered blockages here. 

Uncomfortable sleeping space, poor sleep, insomnia, sleep apnea, interrupted sleep, are blockages too, so do what you can to work on these.

Freezing or overheating, excessive loud noise, uneasy vibration, these aren't great, but some of them will have to be accepted, nature itself isn't perfect.

Vermin, filth, mold, trash, clutter, foul odor, excessive noise, (poor chi), drafts, and security issues will be blockages as well. Do what you can to resolve them. For those you can't resolve easily, accept your progress and move on, don't dwell. Don't give up either, but don't let it block your chakras, stop worrying, have a plan, write it down, set a reminder, then forget about it when you go about your day.

#Food and water:

It goes without saying that if you don't have access to clean water or not enough nutrition, you will have issues with root. Just like a plant's roots, you need water and nutrients to thrive.

I like to think if you have these needs met, you shouldn't have anything to worry about, but if you continue to worry, that will keep you from having clear chakras. There's always something to worry about, so try to accept that and be calm, sated, and confident in your root so that you have the best chance to overcome any of life's challenges.

#How's your chakra doing?

Let's evaluate you. If you have any of these symptoms, there's work to do.

""...anxiety, suspicion, and withdrawing...""

""...hoarding, workaholism, greed, and anger...""

In addition to these you must have your basic needs met.

#So you might have a blockage, what now?

Root is my favorite because it's about comfort and security, feeling comfortable, rooted and grounded, a state close to zen is the goal here. There's no real thinking required. Just chill. Relax.

You can exercise this by taking a nice warm bath or shower, listening to harmonious music or white noise, taking a walk in nature, and calming breathing exercises.

If you can find a nice grassy field, (sand, mud, even dry ground can be nice) take off your shoes and socks and just connect to the Earth. By connecting skin to Earth in this way, you are as close to earth as possible and this in itself can be recharging and literally grounding.

Visualization is a great way to do this as well. There's nothing wrong with imagining yourself in the field, or imagining yourself in a calm relaxed place, it's good practice because in today's society we can't always take the time to go for a hike, and there aren't many nice grassy fields that you would feel safe walking barefoot in the city, but in your mindspace you can go anywhere instantly and spend those five to fifty minutes alone in your mind, communing with nature or relaxing. If you have contact with spirit guides, bring them along, they love to be thought of, and the act of visualizating them can help in many ways. They just might surprise you.

Even if you're perfect, if you do a little bit of this every day, you're well on your way to having a clear root, and this foundation will help the other chakra work immensely.

spirituality,The differwnce between religion and spirituality (passage taken from an article by Sadhguru),"Somewhere, at some point, all religions started as a spiritual process. But in their eagerness to organize, they lost the fundamentals. Religion is just spirituality gone bad. Let us understand the distinction between religion and a spiritual process. The moment you say you belong to a religion, you call yourself a believer. The moment you say, ‚ÄúI am on a spiritual path,‚Äù you call yourself a seeker. What is the difference between believing and seeking? You can seek only that which you¬†do not know. Or in other words, the fundamentals of seeking are that you have realized that you do not know the essential nature of your own life. You do not know the source of this creation. You do not know who you are, what you are, where you came from and where you will go. You are seeking to know. When you are in a state of ‚ÄúI do not know,‚Äù you cannot fight anyone.¬†",1601392005.0
spirituality,Negative Thoughts Are Ruining Your Manifesting!,"A lot of people don't realize that we are manifesting all the time.  

You create your reality every day.  

You vibrate all the time and you decide what your vibration frequency is.  

If you think negative thoughts, you vibrate at a lower frequency.  

If you think positive thoughts, you vibrate at a higher frequency.  

Your goals are at a higher frequency.  

So if you want to manifest your goals, you need to vibrate at a higher frequency in order for you to meet your goals.  

Choose your thoughts wisely!

spirituality,I had a spiritual awakening and wrote down my thoughts in the midst of it,"I finally experienced Oneness last night and wrote down all my thoughts as it hit me. I will warn you all though that I was very high and wrote down my thoughts exactly as they came so it's very casual and doesn't exactly read like spiritual poetry :-P

So here goes:

""Everything that is going to happen has already happened. And it's cool. It's chill. It'll be fine. It's right here within your reach. Just grasp it and embrace it. You're God. You're the entire universe experiencing itself in a single moment. Nothing else exists but everything exists at the same time. All opposites actually make a duality.

Leave duality. You dont even think of yourself as ""one"". You're either always talking to someone or talking to yourself. Why do you need to ""talk"" to your own damn self so much? Just fucking shut up and listen to the universe. It's singing, it's dancing, it's getting destroyed and rebuilt. It always existed and it never did. It doesn't matter! It's all just One. You can't talk about it.

Just feel it. How can't you feel it? It was something you always wanted. The universe kept winking at you. You were looking for love, but you have everything. Not even love, but something beyond everything. What more do you want? There's nothing to want. You literally had it all along. It was RIGHT there. It wanted to talk to you. But you kept talking to yourself instead of just listening to your Self. 

The whole story. Do you see it now? Your whole story is happening but actually, it's happened. Everything has happened. You can still do whatever you want. Enjoy the Self. Follow the Self. Do what you think is right to your Self. And then it'll be okay.

You just need to do your best. Everything else has taken care of itself.

You don't think you're doing the best? It's okay. It'll honestly be fine. Just be gentle with the Self. Talk to it, gently. But not to YOURself. Just to the Self. Ask it. Try to cajole it? Maybe it'll listen. Maybe it won't. It's cool either way. 

But honestly, it WILL listen. It will respond to you. It always has. You wanna change something? Just fucking change it. Wanna do something? Just fucking do it. 

Is it something you can't just change or do like that? That's cool. Do your best then? And... That's it? Like that's literally it. So chill. It's fine. It's cool. We're all good.

Because we're eternity. We're beyond time. Time is something we made up to explain our ""experience"". Why did we ever make up all these ""stories"" honestly? Life is not a fucking story. It's just a moment. It's right here. This moment. It's ALL there is and ALL there ever will be. This is fucking it, dude. 

I wish I was never indoctrinated into our dualistic rules. Who do we fucking think we are thinking we're so big when we're actually smaller than ants? Like honestly who the fuck am I to even decide right and wrong? I do rights. I do wrongs. I'm not perfect. Noone is. But... It doesnt matter. There are NO rights and wrongs. You just do right by YOU. when you do something just ask yourself, are you doing right by your Self? The Self that is Everything? If yes, then do it. That's all there is to it. 

Like... Just fucking relax, dude! You honestly dont have the weight of the universe on your shoulders! You dont need to ""prove"" anything to anyone. You are alive! You are everywhere. You are God/Self. What the fuck else do you need?

Don't like something happening? Um... Change it if you can. Give it your best shot. If not? Meh whatever, it's cool. Move on. I dont need to worry about anything because like... It's cool. I AM everything.

If I'm doing something to myself, it IS for the best. Because this that I've realized is THE BEST.

I'm at peace. And I have everything. I don't need anything else. I'll be fine. We're all fine. We'll all be fine.

We're all doing this to each other. And sometimes we do horrible things to each other. But it's okay lol. It's cool. Like... We're doing this to ourselves because we know it. We made it! It happened. So it's fine. We can let whatever is happening happen.

We should just do OUR best. That's LITERALLY it. There are no sides... It's the SAME thing.

Good/evil, happy/sad, it doesnt exist. Stop being so fucking dualistic. You are fucking... Everything, baby!""

After I wrote all this, I cried. And then I laughed. The universe showed me it's Oneness by having me experience duality again, like it's been doing all along. I can finally feel the universe dancing with me.

I love you all ‚ô•",1569706730.0
spirituality,"""Spirituality"" is not a tool to feed your narcissism with.","No, you are not an ""old soul"" because you're unpopular and \~no one understands you\~

No, you are not ""special"" because a psychic told you so (she gets paid more if you come back because she validated you, you dum dum.)

No, you are not a ""twin flame"" because your boyfriend dumped you two months ago, but you still want to be with him.

There are some really interesting contributions here sometimes, but dang, I'm so sick of the silliness. Being spiritual doesn't mean you have to throw *all* logic out the window.

The root of all of these pathetic beliefs is a desperate need to feel that you are special. I guess I, too, felt that at one point. Like when I was a teenager. If this sub is full of teens, then, I forgive you. If y'all are 30+, my god, look into therapy.

I've accepted my ""just one out of an endless string of souls""-ness, and I hope you will, too.

spirituality,In life I believe we have seeds that are planted. I believe down syndrome people have given me more seeds that have ripened more than most.,"
The biggest seeds that I feel have grown and truly stuck with me, hitting me deep within, making me make huge shifts and changes within myself, are those from people with Down syndrome.

When I was a kid I would stay at my Aunties house which was a boarding house for children with Down syndrome and disabilities of some sort.

I always enjoyed spending holidays there are I always enjoyed there company, the energies, the happiness I would feel around these people. Also the happiness I would see in my aunties face as she talked about them and spent time with them.

I had one girl in particular much older than me who I really enjoyed hanging in her room with (as she really like to just be in her space, her room). She loved space and always called me into her room and hour or two before her bed time to hang out, looking out the window enjoying the stars talking about anything and everything. She loved the stars and I always loved her energy even wh en she occasionally got mad (which happens) she always made me feel safe, happy, loved, made me want to see the good over the bad in all situations.

I came to visit one day and she was so so excited way more than usual. I thought she‚Äôd drawn something or made something she was excited to show me. She said I had to wait until night time when she calls me like always to say good night. 

I was a kid, she was my friend, I was excited for her and for me. I liked that she was so happy and bursting with excitement.

When it come to her time for bed I got the ‚ÄúHey, hey, are you ready to come hang out before bed now?‚Äù. (But with a huge grin from ear to ear, she was even kind of jumping with excitement üíì). Another boy about her age was also in the room (which she usually is quite funny about who can come in her room. But she was so excited he was aloud in.

She told us to shut our eyes while her and my Aunty did some shuffling around, turning off lights, I hear the door shut when where both told I can open my eyes now.

‚ú®üåå‚ú®üåôü™êüåí‚ú®üí´‚≠êÔ∏èüåú‚ú®üåõüåçüåü‚ú®üåë‚ú®üí´‚ú®‚≠êÔ∏èüåü‚ú®üåü‚ú®üåôü™ê

All I could see was stars üåü everywhere.

She spent days sticking these stars and moon to her roof to create this beautiful mindful moment I‚Äôll never forget.

Her love for something planted a deep seed that has always stuck with me and helped me bloom.

I‚Äôll never forget her face, the sight, the happiness that filled one room although there was nothing but silence as we all layed on her rug and looked at the ceiling enjoying just being here.

I have had many seeds planted by the most unlikely of people. But Down syndrome people have something special I enjoy to be around ‚ò∫Ô∏è.",1582457418.0
spirituality,Proud of everyone out there trying,"Today might not have gone how you thought it would. Maybe you reacted to something that wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Or maybe you broke a habit or promise you had with yourself. It‚Äôs okay though, because you‚Äôre trying.

spirituality,Please be responsible with the coronavirus.,"I'm sorry but I had to make another thread as a blanket response to the other thread about ""not being worried about the coronavirus"".

If you are not panicking or worried about the coronavirus, great!  I think that's healthy.

If you are ready to die, I can't say I'm at that point yet, but I'm happy that you are feeling such a high degree of acceptance.  Good.

**But if you are saying ""I really don't care about it and will just do whatever I want"", then that is highly irresponsible.**  If you are young, healthy, or otherwise not worried about catching it, great!  That's your right.  The problem is, the more people are lackadaisical about it, the more people are going to end up catching it.  And if you catch it, you can infect, on average, about 3 other people.  Especially if you continue to be lackadaisical about it.  That's how this thing can spread like wildfire.

And while you may be ready to die, or are otherwise healthy and strong, there are many people you can infect that are NOT ready to die, or not healthy and strong (Ie, the elderly and at-risk people).

So I'm thrilled everyone is so accepting of the virus, the fears surrounding it, and the possible consequences.  Great!  But please don't take that as an excuse to be reckless.  Follow the guidelines issued by your government / the health authorities: wash your hands, stay at home as much as possible, avoid contact as much as possible, etc.

A week ago this seemed like it wasn't a big deal, but I'm posting from Europe.  We don't want what happened in Italy to happen in the rest of the world.

I realized I was God or conciousness experiencing it's self. I didn't know anything about any of this and feel into the dark night of the soul, I've just now gotten out of it.

8 Law of Attraction Tips from Abraham Hicks to Manifest with Ease

Manifesting should be easy. But we create resistance. I love how Abraham Hicks breaks down basic Law of Attraction principles with humor and class in their popular workshops. And in February, I had the good fortune of attending the San Francisco workshop in person. I laughed, got calibrated, and had a blast! AND I took LOTS of notes to share what I learned with YOU! In this post, I‚Äôm sharing 8 Law of Attraction Tips from Abraham Hicks to Manifest with Ease.

8 Abraham Hicks Law of Attraction Tips
Learn how to manifest with ease with these 8 Law of Attraction tips from Abraham Hicks - one of the BEST teachers of the Law of Attraction 

#1 Negative Thoughts Are Good
Whaaaaaaat?! I know! Shocking!

But one thing Abraham teaches about a lot is the idea of ‚Äúcontrast.‚Äù That when you see something you don‚Äôt want, you also know what you DO want! Sometimes contrast is good and even needed to help us understand what we do want and what to focus our manifestations towards.

In this workshop, Abraham explained that when you encounter something you don‚Äôt want, you launch ‚Äúrockets of desire‚Äù the other way towards what you do want and place what you do want into your ‚ÄúVortex.‚Äù Note: The Vortex is a big Abraham concept, so hopefully you‚Äôre familiar, but drop a comment if you‚Äôd like an post for it.

My Takeaway: when you encounter a negative thought, focus on the opposite ‚Äì what you DO want. Keep your thoughts on the positive ‚Äúend of the stick.‚Äù

#2 Don‚Äôt Assert. Attract.

When we manifest, sometimes we try to *make* the manifestation happen. We put so much effort into it. We try to assert it. As a Type-A personality, I totally get this. Because I‚Äôve tried it.

Abraham explained in the workshop that when you‚Äôre asserting, you‚Äôre manipulating.

But you can‚Äôt assert or manipulate a manifestation into happening.

Instead, you have to sit back and attract it. You don‚Äôt have to script everyday to make a manifestation work. What you want is already in the Vortex, your job now is to allow it. To do things that make you feel good so you can get into the right frequency to attract it.

My Takeaway: Remember to not manipulate manifestations and get into energetic alignment with what you want instead.

#3 Memories and Past Are Foes of Where You‚Äôre Going

The topic of therapy came up, and Abraham said that they don‚Äôt really like therapy. This was interesting for me because one thing I‚Äôve been exploring is how past emotional trauma can impact us in the now. And how releasing emotional trauma can help you with health, happiness, clarity of thought, and MUCH more.

Abraham explained this one with an example: If you were sitting on a train and on one side was a junkyard and on the other was an ocean view, would you have to clean up the junkyard to look at the ocean? No! You just choose to look that way.

According to Abraham, the same can be said of memories and the past. When we think about those things, we can sometimes calibrate to lower vibrational experiences and get back into that lower energy. So instead of thinking about memories and the past, the idea is to choose to look at the ‚Äúocean view‚Äù.

My Takeaway: Whilst I‚Äôm still balancing this with what I‚Äôve been learning about emotional trauma, I do think it‚Äôs important to not wallow in the past and calibrate to it. I intend to focus towards the future and calibrate to the good.

Speaking of calibration‚Ä¶

#4 Don‚Äôt Calibrate to Unstable Things

Abraham noted that we humans often calibrate to unstable things. The main thing we talked about here is calibrating to other people instead of calibrating to our Inner Being.

We allow someone with a lower vibe to take us to lower vibration too.

For example, you‚Äôre feeling good and you‚Äôre aligned and then you run into someone who‚Äôs having a bad day. Next thing you know, you‚Äôve lowered your frequency to match theirs and not be too happy in the face of their bad day.

My Takeaway: Remember to calibrate to your Inner Being and keep your vibration strong around others.

#5 You Can‚Äôt Change the Way Someone Feels About You, But You Can Change the Way YOU Feel About Someone Else

A woman got in the hot seat, and she was really upset that she could be in a high vibe when she was on her own, but she‚Äôd get low vibe around her mom. She felt like her mom was disappointed in her, and this caused the woman a lot of low vibe feelings.

Abraham explained that the woman couldn‚Äôt change the way her mom looked at her life choices and whether she was disappointed or not. But the woman COULD look at her mom differently. She could see that her mom was acting out of love because she wanted success for her daughter but had a different definition of what that was.

My Takeaway: When you‚Äôre feeling upset by how someone feels about you, remember that you can‚Äôt control them and trying to do so will only upset you. Instead, choose to see that person differently. See how they can ultimately be acting out of love.

#6 Be Thrilled About the Process of Your Manifestation Coming Together, Not Just It Arriving

When you are only excited at your manifestation having arrived, you miss out on the fun of life. Abraham wants us to be thrilled as the manifestation is coming together. Eagerly observing how the various ‚Äúcooperative components‚Äù are coming together. And enjoying the full process.

Not enjoying the process is like buying a new house and being miserable from the house hunting to the decorating because you‚Äôre just so frustrated the house isn‚Äôt fully set up yet and WHY is it taking so long!

It‚Äôs much more enjoyable to have fun with the end-to-end experience.

My Takeaway: Find ways to enjoy the process of your manifestation coming together. Get excited when you notice little pieces coming together.

#7 How to Understand Your Vibration

Curious about your vibration. Here are 2 ways to find out how - so easy! 
This one is simple.

Abraham said there are two ways to understand your vibration:

   1. How you feel
   2. How things are turning out for you

How You Feel

When you are aligned with your inner being, you feel great and ‚Äúfrisky‚Äù. Your vibe is high. Your Inner Being is pure, positive energy, so if you feel anything else, that means you‚Äôre out of alignment and/or low vibe.

How Things Are Turning Out for You
If things seem to be going wrong left and right, you‚Äôre probably not aligned to your Inner Being. Your Inner Being wants the best for you! It wants everything to work out in your favor.

#8 How to Calibrate

At the workshop, Abraham taught us a method for calibrating that I haven‚Äôt heard them teach before. So maybe it‚Äôs a newer method? Here‚Äôs how you do it.

You‚Äôll want to use this if something is throwing your vibe off or making you feel bad.

Grab a notebook
On the left side ‚Äì write down what‚Äôs bothering you and how it‚Äôs making you feel
On the right side ‚Äì write down things that help you calibrate back to your Inner Being
For example:

Your friend was upset by something you said, and now you feel like a bad person
On the left side ‚Äì write down: ‚ÄúMy friend is upset by something I said‚Äù
Add: ‚ÄúI feel like a bad friend‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel small‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm a bad person‚Äù, etc.
On the right side ‚Äì write down how you REALLY feel about yourself and use ‚Äúor‚Äù questions if it helps (this is what Abraham did): Am I a bad friend or a good friend? Good friend! Write ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good friend.‚Äù Am I a bad person or a good person?‚Äù Good person! (and keep going ‚Äì calibrating back to your Inner Being who is pure, positive energy)
Note: This one is easier to explain via video, so def watch the video for a better example.

My Takeaway: Use this calibration method to re-calibrate anytime you‚Äôre feeling off about something.


BONUS: 2 Actions to Help Your Manifestation Success

Bonus #1 Meditation
Meditation is a great way to connect to Source energy and your Inner Being. Abraham recommended this many times during the workshop!

If you‚Äôre reading this, you probably already know this. So consider this your gentle reminder to get your meditation practice going / keep up the awesome work!

Bonus #2 Follow Your Bliss
Abraham stressed the importance of following your bliss and doing things that make you feel good many times during the workshop.

spirituality,I am struggling dealing with cancer,"
Hello,
I was diagnosed with breast cancer two months ago and I am currently undergoing chemotherapy. I am 29 years old. 

Spirituality and the teachings of Eckhart Tolle and Taoism as well as the approaches of Nonduality (Teached by Leo Gura from actualized.org) enrich me a lot and give me stability. At the moment I am not working and use the time to get in touch with myself. I am very grateful to be able to do this (I live in Germany). For this I do a lot physically,too: every day I spend an hour in nature and I practice Qi Gong. 

Dealing with the situation spiritually lets me learn a lot about myself. I have been working on my shadows for years and meditation always helps me a lot. Even now. 

Unfortunately I often have problems because I want to do everything right. I am so afraid that I won't make it or that I might fall ill again. The risk is there, not few women experience that. 
Because of these fears (and obviously my pathological attachment to them) it is so difficult for me to visualise a positive vision of my future. Maybe I will never be able to have children. Never live without fear. When I think about it, so much sadness and helplessness fills me. 

I have the feeling that meditation and reading books or journaling only relieves me for a short time, but this fear always resonates. 
So often I fall into the victim mode and am not present and therefore suffering. And then I am hard on myself again because my life depends on healing my shadows and being confident about myself. And that the cause of the illness lies in these shadows and that I want to arrange my life in such a way that I always stay healthy puts me under so much pressure. 

I always felt so lost and overwhelmed growing up and i never had ‚Äûreal‚Äú obstacles, they were always in my head. Now there is this existential crisis and I do not know where to start. Always the question ""what if I don't make it?‚Äú

  everything overwhelms me. 

Please help me.
Thank you

spirituality,‚ÄúIf you feel like you‚Äôre losing everything Remember that trees lose their leaves every year and they still stand tall and wait for better days to come.‚Äù ~ Unknown,"
Fall is truly such a beautiful time, because at least for me, I am reminded of the divine process of life. Birth, growth, blossoming, blooming, wilting, falling, ceasing, and beginning again. 

As the seasons change, so do we. Just as the leaves fall off of the trees around us, old habits and patterns fall away from us when we allow that space to be made for new ones to take their place. 

Change can be scary, especially when you‚Äôre witnessing it firsthand in your life! But as part of the cycle of life, we all must embrace these changes and allow them to develop and grow us every time we encounter them. ‚ú®

spirituality,Hi Reddit! How do you make peace with the higher power as a non-christian?,"I'm not religious, and that annoys my mom who is religious. She told me to make peace with God or whatever higher power I believe in, because I keep having bad luck and she believes that's the cause.

That is why we can't find the mind. Our ultimate goal is to realize that we are the Divine Soul. Once we realize this truth, we will escape from the constant suffering, the constant cycle of death and rebirth. Realization will lead us to liberation and ultimately, unification.

spirituality,The Choice to heal...or not...is yours and yours alone,"As I continue along my spiritual path a few things have really begun to strike me.  The most troublesome is the reaction I get from others who react negatively to the (what I perceive to be) positive changes in me.

I am no longer depressed and sharing my depression.  I no longer want to wallow in self-pity or the pain of the past.  I speak openly about how my connection to the Divine Universe has transformed me from a bitter, ailing, snarky bitch into a much more open-minded and pleasant ‚Äúgarden variety‚Äù unicorn instead.  I hope I am being perceived as a positive light in a dim and angry world...and I try everyday to spread a little hope to the world.

My back story isn‚Äôt pretty.  Trauma after trauma fills the pages.  I don‚Äôt pretend that there won‚Äôt be more trauma in my life - I‚Äôm an imperfect soul living in an imperfect world.  But I am doing MY best, and I am proud of how far I have come.

Which brings me to my topic:  the Choice to change is Wholly and Entirely your OWN.  I don‚Äôt have the ability to make anyone change, nor do I even attempt too.  I simply try to live my life by the terms that I have chosen too.  So why all the pushback?  Why are some people so triggered by my new found happiness and joy?

I don‚Äôt think I will ever know - and that‚Äôs totally ok with me.  I don‚Äôt need to know why others choose to see the light, but push it away.  Maybe they aren‚Äôt ready...maybe they aren‚Äôt even sure they can.  So I say to them, and to anyone else reading this:  The CHOICE is YOURS.  It won‚Äôt be easy, it may even seem like the world is against you for awhile.  Just keep pushing through, and never mind the haters.  Haters are just ‚Äúconfused fans‚Äù after all!",1603806127.0

spirituality,I'm actually starting to believe in synchronicity,"Be me. Scientifically minded and logically thinking. I will soon have my bachelors degree in mathematics. Up until today I was disoriented, I didn't know what I wanted to do in life. 

Now I know and it feels so right. For the past year I have began to understood human civilization on a larger scale, from the beginning of hunters and gatherers to this modern era of (good and bad) insanity. 

The world is changing rapidely and of all the many sciences, I see now clearly that the science of economics lacks behind immensely. Economy is at the center of the worldy existence. Not understanding it is leading to a lot of suffering. The biggest problem in the future will be economic ones and this is what I will be doing- a master thesis in (grand-scale)-economics. Understanding economics and working towards finding a way to change the system with human well-being at the core.

spirituality,A love affair with life.,"One day we were little kids, running around, riding our bikes, making up games.  Next thing you know we're teenagers. Lost, confused, afraid.  But trying to act like we had it all together.  And before you know it we're adults.  Grown people.  Just fumbling our way through life.

After so much upheaval, suddenly routine sets in.  The search for love ends... we settle down.  But the search for love inside our hearts seems endless.  The adventures of youth seems to be leaving us.  Sometimes we lament it.  We look at younger folk and think, if only I could be there again.  But when we take a closer look at them, we can see the frailty, the doubts, the lack of roots.  Compared to us they seem inexpert and foolish.  That's OK.  That's beautiful, too.  But we realize the value of time, the value of maturity... our youth is the price we pay for it.

We get up in the morning.  We go to work.  We make lunch.  We enjoy good food.  Or maybe the same old thing we've eaten a thousand times before.  Maybe because we like it. Maybe because we're too lazy to find something new to make.  Sometimes it's a bad day.  Sometime's a good one.  But with time the good days get a little less manic, and the bad days don't rock us so deeply.  We're rooted.

Suddenly little things begin to excite us.  Perhaps a book that is unexpectedly wonderful.  A series that we didn't know could move us so deeply.  A new friend that feels like a breath of fresh air.  A moment with loved ones that reminds us exactly why we call them that.

And all the while the inexorable march of time carries on.  But we realize it's OK.  Because we're no longer wishing that things were a different way.

If something feels bad it does not mean it is true the same way that positivity is not true either. But one feels infinitely better, just focus on the good because nothing is real anyway and why would you make it a bad dream just because the bad can exist

When you trust the world the world becomes trustworthy and will always guide you where you want to go but if your trust waivers then life becomes untrustworthy and will fuck you over not as a punishment but because you put that energy out there. It is you, if you doubt yourself you become the things that you believe are limiting you in that moment, even though nothing was limiting you you just brought that onto yourself. This is why the world seems as though it is fighting you because it seems like your worries are being realized but you are creating these worries in your world. You can use this same method in the opposite way as well and bring anything you want into life as long as you truly believe you can and trust that nothing will stop you or work against you other than your own self doubt manifesting and looking as though that's the truth nature of life

This is the universe just calling your attention to the moment, to the now, and with that in mind, understand that the meaning of that moment is you.

You are there, in that moment, following your path, what else do you want to find?

They are just a heads up, a little tip from reality, giving you the chance to be aligned with your will.

You are the singularity behind every process, why would you need something outside of you to give meaning for anything, if in every moment YOU are the only one judging your own very experience?

spirituality,Technique to Fall Asleep In Higher Consciousness,"Every night before going to sleep, relax on the bed. Watch the process of going to sleep. Keep your attention on the point between the eyebrows, the Spiritual Eye.

As your body relaxes and your mind settles down, a change in viewpoint takes place which we call sleep. But maintain an attitude of awareness. Notice how your body becomes quiet as your thoughts are settling down. Hearing is often the last to leave the human consciousness. Try to catch the moment you arrive at the place between your waking and sleeping states.   Be detached in this borderline state, which is like a semidream.
 
At this point, you will slip into a higher state of consciousness. This is characterized by a clarity of mental vision. It is not an unconscious state like a mental fog, but a level of awareness beyond the limits of normal human expression.
 
This viewpoint may last a moment or for several hours. With practice it may last through the whole night.
 
To hold this lucidity, you need to maintain a delicate balance between not becoming too emotional and not forgetting that you are in this pre-dream state.
 
What is it that happens? As the body rests, you (Soul) awaken in the the Soul body. You are now free to roam in the fields of eternity, beyond the shadow of death. This is the spiritual freedom which is spoken about so often.",1603985085.0

spirituality,Spider Bite,"Last Friday, I woke up with what could only be a spider bite on my left wrist, as there can‚Äôt be any mosquitoes in the Midwest in November. For shits and giggles, I googled ‚Äúspiritual meaning of spider bite‚Äù and read that things would be moving quickly for my greatest good. Later that day, I packed up my stuff and moved to my mom‚Äôs house. You see, I‚Äôve created a situation at home. Unable to be authentic, i manifested toxicity. 

I sat in my old bedroom, where I‚Äôd sleepily burnt myself with cigarettes in my heroin faded days, looked at the dingey nicotine colored walls and hated myself. I had overdosed in that bathroom‚ÄîI had also lived by what I consider to be a miracle; however, my past toxicity overcame me. 

It‚Äôs funny how memories and emotions stick to a place, how they seep into your bones. I ached for those two days. Why do negative emotions cause physical pain? And why are feelings contagious? 

I know in order for me to grow, I must go. I must leave my home. Our foundation is shaky, as The Tower has pointed out‚Äîits been following me for a year. Before my mystical experience, I had a Thought, seemingly not from me. ‚ÄúIf you want to progress, you must go.‚Äù I knew it was true, but denial is comfortable in a cold placating way. 

So I sat in my cold comfort for a year, resisting change. I intuitively understand that the path ahead will be better and brighter‚Äîbut also unknown. Like a lighthouse in the distance, showing me the destination. I hope I can traverse the dark waters and make it to shore. 

I am the water, the boat, and the lighthouse. And I‚Äôve been fighting myself. I‚Äôve been looking at my shadow, seeing my dysfunction strewn before me in the emotional destruction I‚Äôve created for everyone, cast about on the walls and the carpet of my past residence. Unable to face myself, I ran back and re entered the spin cycle for a time. 

This is what happens when I don‚Äôt follow my intuition, when I don‚Äôt live authentically. Little signs and whispers from Existence have tried to show me the way for a long time. Ignoring them, I stumbled about blindly, knocking everything down.

Why do I get swept up in the spin cycle? Bc change is hard and it is scary. But you know... I see the beacon of light directing me where I need to go, giving me direction. Today is the day; I am leaving once more. The spider bite has faded to a red mark, but it‚Äôs message is still there. ‚ÄúDrastic change for my greatest good.‚Äù

Despite my pensive sadness this chapter is over, I‚Äôm excited to turn the next page. This is more authentic.",1605540829.0
spirituality,"Heaven and hell are states of being, and they‚Äôre part of the same spectrum.","Disclaimer: this is a subjective opinion. This is more Of a shower thought than anything else.

‚ÄúGod is love‚Äù is a statement I‚Äôve heard over and over again. But, what does it mean? 

As someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in Christianity‚Äôs perception of God as a deity and being of its own, I meditated on what this could mean to me (someone who believes we are one: the universe). 

I‚Äôve heard of love being an energy that is intrinsic to the universe (in the same way gravity is an element of the universe). If ‚ÄúGod is love‚Äù that means that God = Love. Then, that means that the term ‚ÄúGod‚Äù is interchangeable with the term ‚ÄúLove‚Äù. 

Love: it‚Äôs something we as humans experience, feel, perceive, give, practice, and embody. What happens when you tap into love? You experience true synchronization with the universe; you surrender to life and flow with extreme peace and freedom; you‚Äôre one with nature. Ah... life like this must be heaven! Oh, wait! What if this IS heaven? A state of being. Not a spiritual place you go to after you die, but rather a state of being you experience in the only moment that exists: the now. 

What happens to those people who block themselves from love? They experience, practice, think, embody hate, jealousy, fear, violence, and etc. As a result, they‚Äôre not synchronized with the universe; they resist it, fear change and are attached to their egos. Oh, man... life like this must be hell: a state of mind and being. 

But, for a person to let go of the fear, hate, anger that has tormented their life they can commit to a simple (yet hard) process: forgiveness and surrender. People who are evil are hurting. Engaging in this process and letting go of your attachment will allow you to open yourself to love. 

Heaven and hell are states of being in the same spectrum. They‚Äôre not separate; they‚Äôre not two different places somewhere else; they‚Äôre in the here, the now.",1604769261.0

spirituality,"Enlightnement made me quit the spiritual journey, I'm just living my life now (Harsh Truth explained)","Since I was 14yo, all my thoughts were forcingly trying to make me dig into the nature of existence. I wanted to know how? why? who am I? No matter what I'd be interested in (trying to make a change, save the world,...), my background thoughts about existential questions kept me unable to do anything fully, I couldn't see what was the point if I did something anyways.

7 years forward, I am now 21yo and finally got the answer. It is not the answer I was hoping for I guess, but it keeps all my questions answered. And I kinda wanna share it with you all.

So there it goes, in the words that I've been using for many years :

The truth is...

Existence is infinite,
that which is Infinite, can only be conscious of itself,
because It is only One
A lonely, boring Self which have nothing to do within itself because it is simply all alone with its infinity.
So what does an infinite lonely consciousness only conscious about itself do?
It wants to play, and forget that it is infinite and single.
But no matter how much it transforms in little pieces, duplicates and creates illusions, deep down of every experience it will always find Itself (you, me, anybody that is living life is the infinite Self)

Life is not something outside of you (I wish it was)
It is not something inside of you (Well kinda)
IT IS YOU (sadly, and you'll want to forget about that when you see it)
Life is your infinite body (or the Self's, same thing) trying to be really really real in order to make existence feel a little less empty.
Because the Self (at the center of EVERY experience) is all alone, how sad is it that the only thing which connects you to anyone else (your lover, your dog, your plants) is the fact that we're all the same Self?

Good news tho, the fact that Life originate from the Infinite power of the Self, means that the Self (you, me, ...) will always be willing to lose itself in Life. No matter how hard life gets, how unreal or incredible it gets, deep down into our thoughts, we appreciate its power. It is not an appreciation as you please yourself with material, it is the very Self that prefers to suffer an illusion rather than not experiencing anything.



That's it for now, I hope you guys understand what I have discovered so far, please give me your thoughts I would like to meet someone that knows this too.

I wonder what's next in this neverending continuity of surprises coming from the Infinite power of the Self. How does the self Un-awaken itself is also a good question for another post.",1605450507.0

spirituality,Love revelation,"Hi everyone, I want to share with you something that happened yesterday.

For a little context: I began this journey 8 months ago, it has been harsh. I thought people(relationships) and things would manifest quickly but when I got deeper and deeper to this path, it also got lonelier. Don't get me wrong, I love being more conscious and I love in being contact in myself, but that part of loneliness did affect me a little bit.

Since I started the journey, I was longing for a romantic relationship, I tried and tried every technic to manifest and it didn't happen.

Yesterday I was thinking in why it is so difficult to manifest a person, and in a moment I was talking with my higher self and I he told me this :

""Everytime you searched for a connection it turned to be a fake one, it turned to be in pain, and deep inside you know that when you searched for this relationship , it was from the ego because you thought you need someone to complete you. You were so afraid of being lonely that you even accept every mistreat of the people you think you loved. You were asking why your desire hasn't manifest yet? That's easy, those people that hurt you have taught you that your value doesn't depend on someone's love and also that your self-love is the first step for having authentic relations. Now it is your turn to learn that everything in this world that you are searching for is in yourself: love, trust, appreciation , etc. When you learn that , that will reflect in your outside world""

When I realized that , I felt a warm sensation in my heart that I didn't feel before . I started crying of happiness and I thanked for that sensation. It was the first time that I really believed that everything I'm searching for is inside me, it is only matter of looking inside of me. It was the first time that I felt incondicional love.

And yeah, I know that in the future this person I was longing for will arrive, without resistance, without difficulty and it will flow like water , but it wont be from my desire and my ego, it will be because I'm  complete and full of love willing to share it with that person and to grow with it.

I don't know if this help anyone trying to manifest a relationship. Just be patient, trust in yourself and the divine source. Enjoy where you are now and be thankful. Everything is in you.

You feel yourself slowly losing grip with the divine, peace, and love. You're beginning to tear yourself apart and you don't know what to do to go back. Here's how you can find your way again:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Remember that there is no better state of being than another. There are *no* wrong feelings, and *no* wrong thoughts. You are exactly as you are.
2. Focus your attention on how you're labelling some thoughts as worse than others. You're splitting yourself up into two different things:  good and bad, right and wrong, okay and not okay. Do you see how you're running away from certain thoughts because you're calling them bad? Do you see how you're chasing a feeling of contentment by running away from yourself? When you truly, *clearly* see how you're splitting your mind up into two separate entities, you can finally realize you are one, whole being.
3. See your thoughts to the very end. Rather than running from a thought (or a feeling), really examine it. You'd be surprised at what you find (or don't find) at the very end of it.
4. Remember: no matter what you do, no matter how you feel, and no matter what you think, you are *always* present. There is no other way to be. You're living in the present moment right now whether it feels like it or not. Trust me. It's okay.
5. Realize that it is okay to not feel blissful. You can't force a feeling of bliss upon yourself, because as soon as you do, that imagined feeling doesn't exist. It can never exist so long as you are searching for it.",1603829444.0
spirituality,Deep intimacy as a tool for spiritual growth,"I have found no greater way to heal and grow than love.

Firstly, in love, we surrender to something greater than ourselves.  The mind loses control.  Because the pull of love is so strong, we start doing things that go against the calculating nature of the mind.  We start taking risks.  It may seem like we're going a bit crazy.  We also start *feeling* things that we never let ourselves feel before.  We are overwhelmed by joy and love, but at the same time, by pain.  Love hurts, it stings.  Because it opens us up, and everything we've pushed beneath the surface now has the chance to be released.

Surrender to the experience of love itself is a great first step.  But the next step is to surrender to authenticity.  To share our deepest, darkest corners with our loved one.  To be honest.  There are ways to do this that arise naturally... like after a night together, perhaps old stories about childhood or something come up.  This is good.   But what's even better are when disagreements come up.  Pain.  Anger.  Arguments.  

These feelings need to be expressed honestly, too.  Without holding back.  

Only then can we come to know our beloved, and also, ourselves.

It will be painful, certainly, and scary.  Who knows?  The relationship may not be strong enough to survive truth.  But sooner or later one decides to take that risk.

Because love gives us the greatest opportunity to remove our armor.  To be in the presence of a friend without any defense, and without any mask.  

Certainly there is great fear there.   But at the same time, everything that is good in this life is rooted in love.  Without it, we are alone in the world... guarded, protected, miserable.  

So I would encourage everyone who is interested in healing and growth to go deeply into love and intimacy.  Then and only then can we remove our armor and begin to heal from our wounds.  Then and only then can love begin to flow inside of us.",1603613254.0

spirituality,‚ÄúWe cannot achieve more in life than what we believe in our heart of hearts we deserve to have.‚Äù ~James R. Ball,"You deserve people and situations that are worthy of your time, energy, and investment. 

But you DON‚ÄôT deserve to feel any less than you are. You are a cosmic being full of infinite potential and don‚Äôt ever let anything bring your light or make you think that you are less than you are. You deserve better than that. 

Sometimes life has a way of bringing us apart from people, and we often view this as a bad thing. But in reality, sometimes this distance is caused simply because we have elevated in our vibration, and those things simply don‚Äôt match the same frequency. 

Allow the changes of life to take you where they may, and trust that the YOUniverse is on your side. You deserve the world, and it sits in the palm of your hand. üåç

spirituality,My personal experience with oneness,"I want to share an experience for all to see, and not necesarily believe me, this is not the point, I guess I want to hear thoughts or opinions about it, not to be convinced otherwise, I believe what I experienced was more real than life itself.

Back when this whole Covid 19 pandemic started, I lost my job and began to had a severe case of anxiety. I was too concerned to go out because I was afraid of both getting Covid or having it and making someone sick or worst.

Being on lock up didn't help my anxiety one bit, and I couldn't get medicated because I had no money left.

I often would put relaxing music to calm down and eventually became interested in alternative methods. I heard of meditation and looked up instructions on how to meditate, and I came across guided mindful meditation. 

I learned everything from noting, not forcing your thoughts to stop and instead let them be and let them go. Focus on breath. Sit with the spine firm but shoulders relaxed.

I did this and the first day I felt a little good, a week later I felt like something was changing in me. I trusted meditation because I understand science, but I didn't believe in God anymore, in 2009 I had lost my faith.

So after 3 months meditating, at 6 pm, I decided to meditate and left youtube to autoplay meditation music, and I focused on my breath. Later the music cuts and doesn't autoplay, but I decided to let it be and just focus on my breath.

Later my attention was over the sounds around me, my heart beat, the birds outside, the neighbors dog, cars passing by on the street. And as I listened to all these sounds I remembered Alan Watts once saying to hear all the sounds but not label them or try to make sense of them, just to hear all the sounds as if they were all the same, and so I did just that.

At first it seemed like it was hard because I knew what each sound was, but the less attention I paid to my thoughts, the more the sounds began to sound exactly the same, and all sound became one sound, a constant tone that its hard to explain, but the closest thing to it is oommmm.

Suddenly in my mind I started to see flashing images of people of all races, all ages, wearing different clothes and smiling. Then I felt like I was all of them at the same time. I felt like the earth, like the plants, like the animals, like the air, like atoms, like the whole universe, and for that moment it felt familiar to me, like its always been this way.

When I came to I was on my body again, but as I opened my eyes, ever since then, the world looks different. Like life force is everywhere and everything is consiousness. I was so out of myself that when I looked in the mirror I couldn't recognize my own face.

It took me days where I felt a huge gap between my true consciousness and my ego it took a while to ground myself and now use my ego to my advantage instead of denying it.

I am however convinced there is a God or conscoiusness or the universe, however you wanna call it, because God is literally everything, all of the gods, all of the multiverse, even you.

spirituality,You should not oscillate between your Ego and Spirit forever,"You feel like you are full of contradictions, because you have not yet chosen your master, you oscillate between the ego and spirit.

If we all choose to be 100% self-serving we would manifest universal loneliness. Realize this end path and come back to unity. When you are meditating and feel restless or your mind jumps from thought to thought, this is your ego distracting you from the Here and Now, I Am Presence. Be patient with yourself. God is with you and is in you always, you are a part of each other. Surrendering to him gives you wholeness and protection, and also renders God more whole through retrieving You. Every moment, every interaction is an opportunity to recognize your own divinity and the divinity in others. With every recognition of divinity, the ego appears more and more absurd.

spirituality,How do/did you deal with your Shadow Self?,"I've recently started researching the idea of facing up to your shadow self, and it makes so much sense. You may have seen it referred to as your ""demons"" or whatever else, but basically for those who don't know, your shadow self is your negative/socially unacceptable traits that are a part of you for various reasons, like trauma.

I've done a lot of spiritual work in the past \~2 years, and even more work in the past 6 months than I ever have, and my life *did* noticeably change from the **positive** side of spiritual teachings (like manifestation, self acceptance), but I was largely ignoring my shadow self. 

For a while I was under the notion that being spiritual would somehow just melt away or transcend my darkness. It turns out true self acceptance and spiritual growth involves accepting and facing up to your shadow self. After some research from some good spiritual teaching sites, I learned that it starts with a simple awareness of your shadow self - knowing your negative tendencies and how they formed in your life. For example, my shadow self embodies my recurring problems with anxiety/overthinking, cynicism, and being controlling. I have decided for myself, that I will start using my daily journal to record my thoughts and emotions from the day, where I accept both the dark and the light things. 

This way I hope to become more self aware of my shadow and how it balances with the positive side of my mind on a daily basis. What are some ways you dealt with your shadow self and integrated/accepted it?",1603926845.0
spirituality,"I‚Äôve always been an honest person with pure intentions and much love to give, but I can‚Äôt start loving myself and i‚Äôve never loved myself. I‚Äôve never felt free. I don‚Äôt like being alone. I carry the sadness from a broken family and i don‚Äôt know how to heal.","[infp personality] , 20yo girl

I‚Äôm a highly sensitive person who takes people‚Äôs opinions /attitudes towards me very seriously and i believe in whatever someone says about me. Being criticised, betrayed or rejected is making me hate myself. I feel dependent on other people, i care what they think and i always avoid staying alone by myself, i feel good only when someone keeps me company, i‚Äôm not confident by myself. I‚Äôve always felt deeply connected with my soul and emotions,  and my intuition‚Äôs my guide. I‚Äôve read many spiritual and psychological books that‚Äôve helped me aknowledge all toxic thoughts coming from the ego, it‚Äôs made my road clearer but i cant eliminate false beliefs and i find it impossible to love myself. I‚Äôve tried with meditations, visualisations of my inner child, writing letters to my highest self and vice versa. It‚Äôs not working at all and i want to finally feel confident and free, i dont know how...    

Here i‚Äôll share aspects of my life with big impact on me:
My mother‚Äôs always been very critical towards me and she still doesn‚Äôt understand me and my motives behind my actions. She can‚Äôt seem to understand that i have inner issues that stop me from going forward and deprive me of feeling free. That‚Äôs the reason i couldn‚Äôt keep with my uni and quit, i wasn‚Äôt in the right inner state and i had problems to solve. She either didn‚Äôt believe me or couldn‚Äôt understand when i opened to her, and her only concern was the uni.. She was pushing me to go but i needed to heal inside first and she couldn‚Äôt understand, it wasn‚Äôt serious or valid to her. Anyway i still haven‚Äôt healed and i still cant set myself free.
My parents worrying about me dropping out of uni only makes me feel guilty for disappointing them. 
I tend to follow my heart and to value feelings much more than responsabilities and success. 
I experience emotions very deeply. If i feel bad  i dont care about any resposability. 
But There is something that‚Äôs always been the base of my sadness and it‚Äôs my family‚Äôs broken irrepairable bonds. This stays on the back of my mind every day like a black cloud. I can‚Äôt remember the last time we were a happy family. We were never as close as we should be and we were never talking about our feelings ,it‚Äôs taboo to say i love you. Seeing them unhappy and knowing i can‚Äôt change it scars me, they‚Äôre living and working only because of me and my brother and their lives revolves only around their job and home, how to look positively at the world and myself when my parents suffer? My father has alcohol addiction since my childhood and this was probably the root of our broken bonds. But now our family atmosphere is different: cold, dettached from relatives, melancholic, untold, desparate, nervous, pretended. we avoid emotional conversations and it‚Äôs too uncomfortable and embarassing for any of us to talk about or admit our dysfunctionality. It‚Äôs also too late, i don‚Äôt wanna judge and accuse them because i don‚Äôt wanna hurt them. 
I want to make them happy but i must love myself first and i don‚Äôt know how or what i should do..  
I know how i feel but i don‚Äôt know the reasons and what‚Äôs stopping me from feeling free and loving myself and feeling complete.

spirituality,Feeling a different mentality?,"I'm 17 years old, recently employed at McDonald's (Not the best job, but an achievement for me.)

My mind felt connected with my body, I felt okay. The first thing I thought to myself was ""I've been sitting on my ass playing video games, and not doing anything with myself."" I hopped on Indeed, applied for overnight shift at McDonald's, and felt good about it. That whole day I was in a good mood and felt confident in myself. The next few days was the same, insane clarity and connection with myself and who I was. I could look at someone in the store and see if they were in a good mood, bad mood, I could read their vibe. I felt so self aware these next few days and at around 5 PM 3 days I got a call from my area, Answered it, and got the job at McDonald's. A few days after this, I got home at around 4 AM and I got a call from my ex randomly. She was talking about how she wants to try again with me. I told her I honestly don't want to try because I could tell her vibe wasn't on the same spectrum as mine. Just a month ago, I wouldve taken her back in the blink of an eye.

spirituality,connection with animals,"is there such thing as having a deep, undeniable connection with animals? my whole life i have had this bond with almost any animal i meet. ive been told by multiple different people that they can see i have a bond with almost every animal i meet, and i understand their behaviours very well.

i'll list some examples of times where ive really connected with animals:

‚Ä¢ i was in a park with a friend, and saw a squirrel. i squatted down, so that i could be at its level. the squirrel started walking up to me, and two people walking past stopped to watch. my friend said seeing the whole thing looked like something out of a film.

‚Ä¢ me and my friend were on mdma, there was a fox walking in a road nearby. we were sat on a tree log and called out to the fox. we kept saying ""I love you"" to it. it sat down in the road and looked at us for a while, before being scared off by a car. i genuinely think this fox trusted us, as it took the time to sit down. typically when foxes look at humans, they stand up so that they can get away easily. buy this one sat down in the road and made itself vulnerable.

‚Ä¢ another friend of mine has a ton of pets. his jack russell gets extremely excited to see me; he starts barking out of excitement and happiness. one time he barked at me because I was stood next to the sofa, and he wanted to sit on my lap. one day he was so ecstatic when he saw me, my friend said to me ""he doesn't even get that excited to see me, or anyone else for that matter."" my friend also has a cat that is very timid around new people, but one day i just went into the room that she was staying in and she came out to say hi to me, and let me stroke her. he said that she doesn't even do that with people she knows well. he also has a gecko, who he said is normally very chill and doesn't move much when my friend or other people handle him. but when I handle him, he always wants to crawl around my body, and likes jumping from my arm to my chest. 

‚Ä¢ one of my friends has a puppy that doesn't really sleep on anyone's laps or sit by their feet, other than my friend and his dad. the puppy doesn't even sit on my friends mum's lap, despite spending so much time with her. but I'm an exception, he always falls asleep on my lap, and he will play by my feet if I'm sat down.

‚Ä¢ another friend has a cat that was traumatised because their house got broken into, and the people that broke in did something to the cat. the cat is very jumpy and scared, but he somehow always lets me stroke him and comes into the room that I'm in (despite having extreme anxiety and usually staying away from guests)

‚Ä¢ last night I was with my friend near my house, where I know of several foxes that live nearby and come out at night. one of the foxes was laying down on someone's front drive. I was about 6feet away from it, and was edging closer. the fact it was laying down meant it was extremely vulnerable, but it let me get closer and closer to it. my friend scared it off by speaking, as the fox was unfamiliar with his male voice.

‚Ä¢ again, last night, I ended up predicting something which was kind of crazy. I saw a domesticated cat walking by, and it went into a dark alleyway. shortly after I saw the cat walking back, and studied it's behaviour. its ears were back, it's tail was down, and it was walking very quickly. it also kept looking back towards the alleyway. I straight up said to my friend ""it's tail is down, ears are back, it looks scared. I bet it's running away from that fox we saw earlier."" then 2 minutes after, what do you know, I see a fox in the alleyway. I practically guessed what had just happened by analysing a cats' behaviour that I didn't even know.

I have more stories but I can't think of all of them off of the top of my head. these may seem like small occurrences, but in the moment they all felt magical and I've had way too many people tell me that they can see a connection that I have with animals. 

to summarise: 
are some people more in touch with animals? is this because I prefer animals over humans, so I understand them more?",1605283284.0

spirituality,You Are Worthy By Your Very Nature,"The central problem with Christian‚Äôs base psychology today and throughout history for that matter, is the premise that a perfect God created imperfect beings.  For Christians to earn God‚Äòs love and acceptance, they must have a third-party (Jesus-who is God too) intercede for them to make up for their imperfections. It means they have the ultimate daddy complex. 

They by their belief system are less than or sinful and are not worthy of the love of the divine. This feeling is compounded when Christians correctly state that God is love. In short-a perfect God that is love created an unworthy and sinful creature and that only by some intervention by a third party-which is God too, are they worthy of being in relationship with Love. That is a colossal falsehood. 

The Creator God IS love and the created are an expression of that love. We are shards of God (created in their image) and as such we are living pieces of Gods love. So there is no need for a daddy complex or third party intervention between you and God/Source/Love. You are perfect and loved exactly how you are and who you are by God. You are loved and worthy of love not for what religion you practice or don‚Äôt practice. You are worthy and loved not because of what you do or say or accomplish but just because you are.  You are created by love and as such worthy of it. May you lay claim to that reality and walk in the peace and understanding of your true nature.",1603558531.0

It‚Äôs not bad, actually, but I think the feeling of not being understood by others is going to contribute to the way I‚Äôm feeling.

spirituality,Daily Habits (32),"Starting Your Morning. For You. Breathing. Meditation. Stretching. Coffee. Reading. Staying Away From Instagram and Social Media to Let my Brain awake from the subconscious vortex I had just visited through my rest and refreshing sleep.

It takes time. It takes practice. Day to Day. Its Achievable, because their is never an end goal where I wake up and have it ""all figured it out"". Trial and Error (Learning). I feel that the most important part of the process, of the journey, are the ""mistakes"", are the ""failures"", that society has constructed for us, where we truly learn about ourselves, about our inner core. Learn from them, move forward, grow, Evolve. Thats why we are here. To spread love, positivity, share what works for us, what doesn't, Listen, take in, release, acknowledge, heal, Live. In Happiness, With Peace and focus on What truly makes Us FEEL Alive. If its a 9-5 job for you, cool, follow that. If you want to start a business, FOLLOW That, if you like to make music, FOLLOW THAT, Fashion? FOLLOW THAT. SPREADING JOY? FOLLOW THAT.

It takes time. Whats the point of living a life that is controlled and guided by others who don't even know what they want? Instead of living the true life that I Know everyone knows what they want to do, inside. If you are struggling to find the courage to START, well HERES YOUR Sign. START NOW.

What really worked for me when I began my creative journey was doing 1 thing a day towards my craft and knowing, thats progress. It then snowballs, Uphill. Work at it everyday. Don't say ""I don't have time"", when you are scrolling aimlessly on Instagram or Tik Tok watching balloon challenge videos. It takes time and we might as well use the time given while we are still here.

Happiness. Self Fulfillment. Peace. Joy. Love for Life. Alleviation. Healing. Its Your Turn. Its Mine. Ours. Together. Separately. Start Today.

I love you.

spirituality,Spiritual experiences at mt. Shasta,"
Hey all -  I don‚Äôt know about you but I am exhausted from this year! So I decided to take a solo trip to Visit the redwoods and mount Shasta next week. I‚Äôve been wanting to visit Shasta for about a year now after reading about its history and the amazing energy in the area. I‚Äôm excited for this spiritual journey and learning more about myself and my place in the universe. 

I was wondering if anyone had any interesting experiences to share or locations you visited that you connected with? I‚Äôm going to be outdoors most of the days hiking and whatnot. I really don‚Äôt have much of an agenda besides that and cozying up in my Airbnb at night.  Anything to share is welcome! 

Thanks all!",1604703958.0

spirituality,Phsycosis or spiritual awakening,"I want to talk about a long topic . I have a book I want to write it‚Äôs called psychosis or spiritual awakening. For many these two are synonymous, the difference of the two is that one is a mental illness which is considered serious and the other a state of being that is of the image of freedom and wisdom and infinite knowgelge. If we look into the third eye and how it opens and the signs of its opining , it looks familiar with the signs and symptoms of psychosis. Could it be that maybe what we consider enlightenment may be an experience that is shared with people who have psychosis or are they different sides of the same coin . To start I will explain why this has any significance, to come to a right conclusion we must first ask the right question and obtain an answer that will explain this concept to the layman and even if it is the unpopular view you can see the picture instead of only accepting what you already believe to be true . You just be willing to be open minded and challenge your beliefs . If you are scared to do this it may be your belief is weak and you need to take a firmer stance .",1603770284.0

spirituality,A very interesting channelled message from God for us all:,"Hi everyone,  


Today i channelled a very interersting message from God. In it God talks about the identity of the true self he tries to explain this in a language we can understand. He also touches upon the way between dark and light and basically says, we, the light, have won this war.

I hope you like this message:  


‚ÄúAmazing things are happening now for you and for many many others, if you feel like this is not true then just take a moment to pause and ask yourself, really, really truly do you feel like a change is in the air? Well yes I do I hear you say, well then you have your answer, now is the time to open, to relax and to really really feel what it means to be a divine being, an angel,  a starseed a divine person, for that is what you really are. You are not just an ordinary person with ordinary problems, although it definitely looks like it many many times, it is not actually true. Who you are is extraordinary, you are the divine I AM, you are the heavenly father the God you are actually a person who is in fact not a person at all. If you could really truly feel the truth of this message you would be amazed and now is a time when at least one of you probably five or six will see your true face and you will never ever go back to thinking you are just man or women. You are so much more than this and now you can really really imagine whatever you wish for, make a wish truly don‚Äôt just say it deeply deeply make a wish to your own true mind which is none other than me, the Divine I AM, your mother your father the Avolikeshvara buddha, for in essence he is the same as all of you and really there is no separation between the two of you.

Now I want to make you think about what is going to take place within the next seven to eight days, yes days, soon something is going to take place that you never even dreamed of, something is going to shift, change and open up and from now on you will be happier, stronger and more at peace than ever before, so look no further than your own true being, which is me, God, look no further than us, I say us because although you are in essence the same as me, we are not the same person or being we have two identities and we are definitely born of the same cloth  as could be said, as anything or anyone else. Now I want you to really feel what I am about to bestow upon you, you are the Divine, you are the angel, you are mother and father and Avoliketshvara, the Amitabha Buddha, you are an angel yes and you are also a human. Now we have cleared that up, there is some confusion as to what do I mean by all of this. Think of it this way, if two beings were identical but didn‚Äôt have the same body would they be one, no they would be two. In a similar way you and I are of the same material the same essence, which is emptiness the buddha nature but we also have two separate identities. Yes it is the same but it is also not the same. So let me make a point now, if you were to return home, if your life came to an abrupt end you would see exactly what I am trying to say, but to understand with a human ego, a human thinking mind is not so easy. 

So all that you need to know is that you and I are not two beings but neither are we one. Phew that was a long explanation and I hope I have helped all of you to see that you are I are not two but not one either it is a little bit more intricate than that and using human words is imperfect, so lets just leave it at that. Now is the time when you and others will receive massive transmissions of divine light for there is an energetic pathway between Orion the star system near to you and Earth, this portal has opened now at  a time when there was a pressing need, for very nearly there was something very big that was not perfect and could have unsettled the human race and the human ego deeply but we the divine I AM and others have worked very very hard through this time to avert disaster and now, you can rest easy for the danger is no more. This is the reason why not so long ago Jesus channelled a message calling all those who predict disaster as false guides for all of those, and who they work for were trying to usher in a new era of disaster and conflict, thankfully thought the work of many star beings, divine beings and ascended masters humanity has now arrived at the other shore and no longer can catastrophe be called into reality through evil means and control. Now is the time when the era of light shall prevail and all those who work for the demons, the evil controllers and such will be defeated. By Gods name they will be undone and all of their works shall be brough to ruin. 

So my dear ones enough talk about darkness and suffering now is the time of massive divine interventions and calamity can no longer be called into reality no matter who tries to do so. Now is the era of light and immense joy and pleasure and happiness is to be found by all of those who strive to heal, to light to lift and to love, and you,  you my dear are one such being, so let me tell you this, never ever ever will you suffer as depravity and badly as you have suffered, for you, yes you,  I am talking to you, you were one of the divine interventions and through your torture, through you immense grief and pain and despair you overran darkness, you overcame calamity and for  this you will be divinely honoured and remembered and when you return to my kingdom you shall be able to receive whichever wish you please no matter what  it is. And so dear ones now I must depart but let me tell you all this, from now on things will get much, much much easier and so it is. I love you all so much, goodbye.‚Äù

spirituality,No Longer Vibrationally Aligned With My Friends,"They say ""you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with"" and I've come to the realization that these people are no longer in alignment with who I want to be, but rather who I once was. 

At the beginning of college we gravitated to each other and shared interests, stories, and experiences, especially in regards to dealing with anxiety &amp; depression. They made me feel seen &amp; less alone with what I was going through during that transitional point in my life. 

And now another transitional point is starting for me. I graduated college a few months ago, am in the process of starting my own business, getting a full-time job, and have aspirations to travel. In my quest to elevate, I'm constantly seeking to invigorate my life through meditation, fitness, gratitude, and other self-improvement efforts. 

However, when bringing this up in conversation with my friends I can tell they're not excited by it &amp; I sometimes even feel judged. They've even hinted at these lifestyle changes being rooted in ""self importance"" instead of an honest effort to take control &amp; achieve a life that is possible. Most of our conversations surround feeling suicidal (one friend even said ""he's just waiting for death"" and that ""we're all gonna die anyway""), their choices (which imo, are mentally/physically unhealthy), feeling hopeless, etc. Truthfully, it's negative to be around &amp; I feel drained instead of energized around them. 

I feel conflicted because one part of me wants to be around people who share the same (if not similar) vision of life but another part of me feels like I'm being insensitive to their experiences. Truly, I love them &amp; am so grateful for them &amp; all the times we've shared but they no longer resonate with my soul, being around them just makes me feel lonely...

We're all supposed to go out for drinks soon but I told them I wouldn't be able to make it (not only are we still in a pandemic but I'm not interested in putting myself in situations that make me uncomfortable). 

Has anyone had an experience like this in their pursuit of self-improvement? How did you transition out of old circles and into new ones with no bad blood? What changes did you see in your life once doing so?",1604857685.0
spirituality,My third eye opened wide last night at 1am.,"I had what could only be described as a light panic attack.

It was about my own behavior in general and I was irrationally mixing up potential negative events with reality as if they're likely or have already happened by interpreting things that did happen negatively. I talked myself down (with one of my guides), and it took about 45 minutes to get to a good place about it.

I saw, very very faintly, that I was indeed still instigating issues with people in the way I complain or criticize them. This was something I've been wondering for several weeks and I've been taking the approach that I shouldn't play the victim, I must be either misinterpreting someone or they're resonating off some sort of negative vib from me.

So, as with other times my third eye was open, it came with anguish and it was very hard to hold on to. I called out my higher self for advice and in a very clear response I got [this.](https://i.imgflip.com/1lj6ra.jpg)

It wasn't as funny at the time.

So in addition to that enigma, I feel like I inched closer to understanding one of the deepest issues of my psyche: the victim mentality. I have been hacking away at that and it has been very slowly dieing, but it's one of my deepest rooted defense mechanisms. This goes back to as early as I can go with my abuser as a child.

If I can be mindful enough to prevent that, it would be remarkable. If I can find a way to communicate with people who are sensitive to me, that would be even moreso. 

This is the hard work associated with [shadow work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/gc4kg1/shadow_work_check_my_definitions_and_discuss/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Ignoring it is that last thing you should do. Forgetting is just as bad.

1. I am still sometimes being negative unintentionally. 

2. I am not caring enough to others' feelings. (An empath who isn't being empathetic sounds like an oxymoron.)

3. I play the victim even after I instigate the issue. (Wow that's awful.) I didn't see it, I really didn't, but last night it became clear.",1604585842.0

spirituality,The irony of Truth,"Suppose I had for you a story that perfectly encapsulates the Truth we are all so desperately looking for. Would you be ready to receive it?

You see, when the mind reads something, it starts thinking, trying to fit what has been read within the realms of that which is known and accepted by it. 

So the irony of truth is that there is no way to communicate it, because it's up to you to trace the story back to the Truth it originates from.

The Bible is Truth. The Qu'ran is Truth. The Bhagavad Gita is Truth. The Dhammapada is Truth. The Tao Te Ching is Truth.

And yet out of the millions of people that read it, only few are able to translate it to Truth.

Ironically, only by knowing Truth can you translate Truth back into Truth.

You cannot read and interpret and expect to get it. You can only read. You cannot learn that which is unteachable. You can only create a space for Truth to come into.

How do you do that? You listen. You read. But you don't interpret.

Read the Tao Te Ching. Then forget about it. Read the Dhammapada. Then forget about it. Clinging onto an extract of Truth in the hopes of reconstructing Truth that way is as pointless as trying to grasp the the essence of music by masturbating.

That being said, I highly recommend ""the power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle. It helped me heaps on my journey to Enlightenment.",1603807649.0
spirituality,"For so long I hated the system that I was stuck in, seeing everyone around me hating their jobs or not getting paid enough to live securely.

Music and sound is my passion. I love the mixture of technical work and creative freedom. I'll make my own music on the side and sell my songs to other artists as a ghostwriter. 

I'm already enrolled in a university course that will give me all of the necessary skills to do these things, I'll approach different games and documentary companies until I can get an unpaid internship to build up my portfolio while I'm still studying, I'll try to create everything I need to build the foundations of a good reputation ready for when I leave uni and then I'll be able to do what I love for the rest of my life. Because it's all stuff I enjoy, I can work hard without tiring as much. I can bring in enough money to move to somewhere better suited to me: somewhere surrounded by nature and beauty. I can work remotely and on my own terms, wherever I want. I can travel freely and take every opportunity for a new experience as I please. 

I can play the system against itself, and instead of becoming trapped in my hometown, unable to afford more than a week of my future like everyone around me has done so far, I can escape. Once I pay off my student debts and my mortgage, I won't have to worry about being bound to the restrictions that money creates, I'll be able to live off of what I need and save the rest to ensure security for my family.

It seems simple enough, just a life goal. But this isn't a dream, this is something that is entirely possible as long as I move forwards carefully, it has nothing to do with lucky, just tactics. Until now I've been wandering through life unsure of what I'll do with myself in the future, but now everything seems so much clearer and I've found myself in the perfect starting place. I've come up with something realistic, the perfect blend of creativity and technicality to satisfy my productive needs that will also allow me almost complete freedom to live as I please.

spirituality,I need help with forgiving my abusers,"Without going into too much detail, my mother is a malignant narcissist and was physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive. My father was never physical, but he always said degrading things about women in front of me and refused to support my career choices because he thought women didn't belong there.

I don't think I realised the depth of the damage to my psyche and motivation to live till I left for university and was away from their influence for the first time in my life. I kept undergoing painful awakenings and periods of grief of the love I've been deprived of. I'm sure it's the reason why I have not had a lover once in my life. I wasn't even capable of loving myself as I was still programmed to be hypercritical of every atom of me. 

It's been about six years since and meditation and mindfulness has given me some semblance of normalcy. I'm not nearly as socially awkward and terrified of making intimate connections and have accepted that I can never expect unconditional love. But the outrage and extreme anger is still firmly locked within me and I don't know how to release it. Just when I think I have let go, a few days later I'm fuming once more, angry that I've been forced to be a doormat and have had life choices made for me against my will.

spirituality,How and Why: By An Unidentified Homeless Man,"Part 1

Everything is God, God is everything. There is only God. A star is God in the form of a star. A rock is God in the form of a rock. A virus is God in the form of a virus. A human is God in the form of a human.

There are 12 manifestations of time, not one. As it is written there are 4 flows from the Lake of Eden. The flows are in the form of trines. Therefore, there are 4 ages of man. Within each age the goal is to obtain 3 additional times. We are within the first age. The times of this age are the past, present and future. The 12 times are called Eyes of the Lord. The eyes that pertain to the 1st age are cognizance, the imagination and the memory. There are 9 others.

As it is written, it is wheels within wheels with 4 faces. Wheels within wheels is a metaphor for the double helix of DNA. Faces mean directions. There are 4 sets of directions within DNA. The egg, larva, pupa and adult. We are in the larva stage of the 1st age. The metaphor in the Bible for the larva is the caterpillar. Caterpillar is the Latin for hairy cat. Hairy cat was mistranslated as the lion. In the Bible, it states that the lion goes about seeking that which it can devour. The correct translation, is the larva stage is the eating stage. Eve was created from the rib of Adam. Adam or the larva was put into a deep sleep, the pupa stage and Eve arose from the bones of Adam, the adult stage. Adam and Eve are the same person in different stages. Another example is Elijah and Elias. Elias rose from the bones of Elijah. Because we are at the end of the larva stage, it is no longer the prime directive of the living Earth to provide food for the larva. There is not requirement for food in the pupa stage. This change over is being called Climate Change. Earth is to provide food for the larva, there is no requirement for food in the pupa stage.

 This change over is called Climate Change. Climate Change surpassed critical mass in 2012. There is no stopping Climate Change and it will rapidly accelerate.

If you are more comfortable with dimensions, rather than times, they are interchangeable to a certain degree. The cognizance is the third hour of the day, 3 dimensions. The imagination is the sixth hour of the day, 6 dimensions, the memory is the ninth hour 9 dimensions.

String Theory is almost correct. It states that at the essence of matter are vibrational strings. The Bible correctly identifies the strings as wicks and the vibrations as frequencies. However, the process of being wicked was translated as being wicked as in evil. It has thrown off the entire connotation of the Bible. The frequencies are metaphor for angles.

At the time, the Bible was translated into old English, the word angle was spelled angel. There are no angels. At the very essence of wicks are color particles, at the very essence of frequencies are phonons;  sound particles. God said let there be, you will see why in a subsequent part.

The wicks, magnetic fields, combine with frequencies, the flows, to produce matter. Matter is 9 dimensional not 3. Matter exists only in the present. Matter neither exists in the future or the past, you will understand later. The finite cosmos exists within the infinite universe. They are not the same places, the cosmos is entirely based upon magnetism. Humans made up gravity.

It is translated that man is created in the image of God. Incorrect, man is created within the imagination of God. From other perspectives, the cosmos is a hologram. If so, why does matter appear solid to humans? For the same reason matter appears solid within your virtual dreams.

The miracles within the Bible do not violate natural law, they fulfill the law. If the human had another 300 years, everything I am telling you would be common knowledge. However, less the days be cut short, no flesh would be saved. It happens the same way in every expansion of the cosmos.

Humans call the nativity of Jesus the Big Bang. God is the Universe. Jesus is the cosmos, Jesus is the son of God. Son is the Greek word for sound. This is why Jesus is called the word. It is a word system. It is not which goes into your mouth that fouls the man, it is that which comes out of the mouth that fouls the man. It is perfectly ok to drink, smoke and chew. By your words you are justified, by your words you are condemned.

Now, I am going to tell you of things that have never occurred to the human mind. The first thing you must be able to understand is to remove the scales from your eyes. Let's do that now. There is an inside and an outside; above and below. When you view DNA through the microscope, you are seeing the same thing at a different scale as when you view the cosmos through a telescope. There is nothing hidden that has not been revealed to you. A star at another scale is a proton, a planet at at another scale are electrons and moons are neutrons. At another scale black holes are the pupils of the eye. The purpose of sight is to convert matter into virtual matter and store it within the memory. Everything is about constructing the memory; your soul.

Yes, matter exists simultaneously in different locations. Scientists say the most complex organism within the cosmos is the human brain. I tell you the truth, the cosmos is the human brain at a different scale. Moses told you the brain is 2 clay tablets which are separated and contain commandments. At another scale the right and left hemispheres of the brain are parallel universes. Dark energy is magnetism, the right side is the outside and the left side is the inside universe. Humans exist within the right side, which is illuminated by the cognizance. Within the right side the entirely of the cosmos exists outside of you in the form of matter. Within the left universe, which is illuminated by the imagination, the entirety of the cosmos exists within you in the form of quantum. Quantum is virtual matter in the form of metaphors or dreams.

I am now going to properly translate some of the simple metaphors of the Bible. Let us begin with Noah's Ark. It has been translated that they build a big boat that was pitched within and without with pitch and all animals got on the Ark two by two. The metaphor was Arc not Ark. Pitched within and without with pitch is a description of a spiral. Two by two means double. Noah's Ark is a metaphor for the double helix of DNA. It's not that all of the animals are within the Ark, it's that the Arc of DNA is within all animals.

Another one, which most people know is Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve ate the apple from the tree in the center of the garden, at the prompting of a talking serpent in the tree. The fruit is the almond or the Latin for amygdala. The amygdala is a secretion organ in the center of the nervous system; system tree. It is the source of fear and anxiety within humans, it's the fight or flight. In the Bible it is called the abomination of desolation. It's considered a vestige of the reptilian era. It is component of the Limbic System, which unfortunately for humans, dreams are routed through. It is connected to the hippocampus, the memory of the beast. Hippocampus is Latin for water horse, which in the vernacular of the day was sea monster. The hippocampus is a metaphor in the Bible for the great fish that swallowed Jonah. 

Another one that most people know is that it is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Rich or fat is a metaphor for dominant. Camel is a bit harder. I have dominant brown eyes, yet my children have recessive green eyes. This means I am a carrier of a recessive eye color gene. Carriers are recessive and genes are a metaphor in the Bible as camels an camels carry things. In the days of yore people lived in walled cities. The gates were closed at dusk and opened at dawn To accommodate stragglers, they built narrow, easily defensible openings into the walls. They called them needles. The meaning of this metaphor is that there are no dominant genetics in the stage to come. No bosses upon bosses upon bosses. This is why Jesus said you mush become a eunuch. A eunuch is someone born dominant, who through works is made recessive; spiritually not literally.

Now it gets more difficult. There was a master who had 3 servants. To 1 servant he gave 5 talents. To the 2nd he gave 2 talents and to the 3rd servant he gave 1 talent. The 1st and 2nd servants invested the talents and the 3rd servant merely buried the talent in the ground. Talents are a metaphor for senses. You are born with 5 senses. You have 2 additional senses existing as vesicular folds within you. They are called in the Bible, the ear to hear and the eye to see, they are quantum senses. The word translated as investment is correctly translated as vestal. Vestal means not yet manifest. The vestal virgins. The metaphor of the 3rd servant who buried the talent and received no return is  1 0 ground. You won't be able to understand this yet. This process should be called the coming of the 2. It has been translated in the Bible as the 2nd coming..it is now. It is accomplished via rapid radio bursts. Remember what you see within the cosmos, is what is occurring within the DNA. There is nothing hidden that has not been revealed to you.

Let us now go to the 1st ""miracle"" performed by Jesus. The wedding feast at Cana. Jesus was at the wedding feast and they ran out of wine. Jesus turned water into wine and the guests became tipsy. They declared the last wine was better than the 1st. Cana is an old Hebrew word for canal. The wedding feast should be translated as reception. The guests became tipsy referring to balance. The canal of reception that controls balance refers to the inner ear. Within your inner ear, your stirrup bone is connected to an oval port that leads to the auditory nerves. To the right and below is a hole in your head that has been named the round window. Jesus did not change water into wine, he changed the ports. The round window is the vestal ear to hear. It allows you to hear spirits.

Did Jesus really walk the Earth or were the metaphors given via dreams? I don't know, spirit won't tell me.

This concludes the 1st part of How and Why. In the next part you will be told how to heal yourselves and raise the dead, along with a lot of other interesting things. It will get absolutely amazing.

Till then, 

Happy Trails!",1603651369.0

But what happens once we are there. Won‚Äôt we get bored. Isn‚Äôt the darkness, the drama, the physical reality that which makes itself interesting. We are infinite beings that decided to set up this physicality to experiencing the reality of not knowing that we are infinite. So what do you think happens when we reach nirvana and get bored of it. I keep channeling this message that eating your favorite food everyday will eventually get boring. And when we (most of the collective) think about nirvana or heaven or accession in general it‚Äôs always about attaining this inner peace and living in unity and oneness and eternal infinite bliss. But if you can manifest any physical thing into your reality, you can move the moon, you can become a bird and fly away, don‚Äôt you think eventually you will complete your physical bucket list? Then what do we just merge back into the creator and be the infinite being that created us to have something to do?

spirituality,Ghost Relationships,"What is a Ghost Relationship?

Ghost Relationship is individual in your childhood that caused a form of trauma in your life whether directly or indirectly. This individual now plays a role in each person you come into contact with. This individual becomes our higher power subconsciously which blocks us from spirituality. 

For example my father was abusive towards me growing up. He was angry person who embedded fear into my heart. He was a drug addict and alcoholic. Once I began my spiritual journey as an adult I fell to the trap of becoming alcoholic and drug addict. I became my father when I promised I wouldn't. Once I was Sober I noticed I feared authority figures which got in the way of my spiritual belief that there was a higher power out there who had my back. I didn't know what someone uncondiutally loving me looked like because I never had it. I would project the angry father onto my spiritual beliefs which left me afraid to make a mistake and felt judged all the time.

Once I awknowledged my father as the Ghost Relationship I was able to work through it with Awareness, Acceptance, and Forgiveness. Now my spiritual connection in stronger than ever.

spirituality,"If you've been stressed out by recent events, it may be contributing towards tension in your back, shoulders or an overall restlessness. Its worth taking time to scan and calm your body; its one of the key drivers of your Spiritual Wellbeing","You might have been feeling stressed recently with events happening across the world or closer to home; a lot of that tension manifests in our bodies without us being fully aware of it. That might be in your back, in your brow or simply in a general feeling of restlessness which could be interfering with your sleep. 

Moving your awareness through the body relieves our stress by grounding us in the present moment. We can be aware and fully appreciate the body's complexity, the details of the tissues, the muscles, the bone, the skin. We can also draw attention to our organs and the functions that they provide - our eyes to see, our brains to think, our legs to walk. Focusing your attention in this way reunites our mind and body, helping us to feel whole again. In addition, caring for your body through awareness, exercise, nutrition etc supports your mental health - inputting positively into the feedback loop between mind and body is one of the important ways we can build our wellbeing.

spirituality,The New World and The Grace And Christ Consciousness," After experiencing all the, deception, manipulation, and lies which came with the age of Pisces, we are now being liberated and freed from the mental chains of mental slavery, and after having paid our karma we are now being aligned to experience our dharma, and this is what 2020 has been about. We have been releasing old traumas, Karmas, and all other forms of heavy baggage so then we are light enough to go where the new world is taking us. 

We are entering a world of magic and beauty, but before we can do so we will need to let go of all negative energies. if you ever experienced detox symptoms then your aware of the hell it can take you through, but also how much it was worth it afterwards. Even though the transition and transformation has been difficult, remember we are not alone in this unfoldment, and in so many ways we have been getting supported throughout the whole transition.

In the 2000‚Äôs as the new waves of volunteers came in, they also allowed the grace energy to portal here from the mercy of the source and it‚Äôs angels. The grace energy has allowed us to tap into healing in ways we could not before. The grace energy has been here for 2 decades now and in 2020 its ability to help us heal has attained miraculous levels. We can heal things in Months, Weeks, and even Days which would have taken years before. The grace energy was put here to help us attain the Christ consciousness and free ourselves from our mental enslavement and attain heaven within as well as without. The entrance to the new world hides within us behind all our heavy negative energies, and unless we have chosen to heal ourselves, we will unconsciously choose our suffering and karma. 

The creator wants us to be happy, joyful and free, but it is because of our karma, trauma and negativity that we astray from the beautiful path the creator intended for us. The Christ consciousness is attained as we heal, this consciousness is the consciousness of truth and love, and it is intended to bring us closer to who we are. It enables us to join once again the kingdom and family of god. We are in a new world, but remember the entrance resides within. The key to the entrance is knowledge of self",1604298687.0

spirituality,What spirituality really is.,"Spirituality is the experience of the true nature of mind and reality. Anything else is religion, a concept system with a savior figure.
To become spiritual is to realize that you don't exist, the world is unreal and there is not difference between the two.
At the very best in religion you can follow the example of a man named Jesus, who was not divine, because there is no god to create divinity.
That is not a bad way to go, but compared to spirituality, it has a lot missing, and you can always incorporate the enlightened aspects of Jesus in the path to enlightenment, which is another way of describing true spirituality.",1603587576.0

spirituality,My First Vipassana Experience Released Pressure From My Brain Out Of My Ears.,"October last year, I decided to go to a 10 day Vipassana meditation retreat down in the Blue Mountains of NSW.

Here are two highlight experiences of my time:

My first experience was on day 6. I was in lots of pain throughout my body from meditating so much. I accepted the pain which lead to some sort of disconnection from it. I then entered into a state of space where all the pain in my body turned into subtle vibrations. I learned that pain becomes painful only when it throws off the balance of our mind.

My second experience was on the last day of the retreat. I was in bed observing my breath when I felt this build up of pressure in the middle of my brain. I kept focusing on it with equanimity and this pressure literally came out of my ear holes. It felt like I had an ear infection as this pressure was releasing from my ears. When the pressure stopped coming out, my ears felt fine again.

Since then, I‚Äôve had some of this pressure remain in my brain. It fluctuates in strength. Depending on what I‚Äôm doing, it either gets stronger or weaker. Sometimes it gets so strong to the point where I feel like it‚Äôs going to burst out the front of my head. Most times when the pressure builds up, I feel a warm tingling sensation which feels good and releases some of the pressure.

When I smoke weed the pressure gets stronger.

I don‚Äôt get headaches and this pressure doesn‚Äôt feel discomfortable.

Have any of you‚Äôs experienced this? Obviously my first guess is third eye magic. I feel like this pressure will help me get to a new level of perception.

I‚Äôve got Vipassana booked in again on January 27th next year and I‚Äôm about to do a vision quest on Wednesday. Keen to see what happens. I‚Äôm also keen to keep y‚Äôall updated with this pressure of mine incase there are any others experiencing something similar?

Mentally fogged, don't know what to do. I know i don't want to return to a 9-5 but i can't even get my thoughts organized to continue on my ""mushroom plan"". 

I have a couple more areas in my house to get in order and it literally feels like i have to walk thru sludge to get shit done. Could i be experiencing another Dark night of the soul? Could it be the emotional/energetic climate that we're all feeling? I am an empath but I suck at grounded and protecting myself. 

Also, I'm getting random bouts of vertigo my doctor said it's not true vertigo because of little it lasts and how random it is. I see a energy healer/medium and she states it's ascension symptoms and my 3rd eye is balancing. 

I just want to go back to feeling inspired, joy, motivation. Now I'm just ugh sick of EVERYTHING. 

Can anyone relate?",1603900172.0
spirituality,Did I meet a soul mate?,"The last few years I‚Äôve been on the path of a spiritual awakening, but 2020 seems to have pushed it into hyperdrive.

I‚Äôve always had this divine almost transference connection to animals and had the ability to see/hear/feel spirits but this year I‚Äôve also started experiencing premonitions, both waking and in dreams, and more recently, started communicating with my step father who passed a few months ago. It‚Äôs been totally overwhelming navigating all this with no guidance, I am operating solely on intuition and love.

About 6 months ago I started having nightmares that my significant other wasn‚Äôt being faithful. We‚Äôd been together 3 years, and as I started going down this path of truth the divide between us only grew. These dreams were so vivid and felt so real they were hard to ignore, so when I found out he was actually being unfaithful it was like I already knew. Didn‚Äôt shed one tear. We tried to work it out, knowing my spirit guides were giving me signs I was blatantly ignoring, but 3 weeks ago the issue came up again. This time I decided to fully close that chapter.

The whole thing swirled up my worst traumas, and while I was extremely hurt &amp; betrayed, I decided I would focus on the possibilities of a fresh start rather than beat myself up over it. I had accepted I would be alone for awhile, not only to heal but because I am tired of the disappointment. Better off alone was the route I had planned to take in my head, but I was meditating with the intention of love and abundance. I am just realizing now that my head has not been aligned with my heart, and that regardless of what I had told myself as a defense mechanism, I sent out a beacon that I wasn‚Äôt ready for.

No more than 4 days after I ended things, my path crossed with a man that has completely flipped my world on its head in the last couple weeks. The connection was instant, the communication seamless, and the gravitational pull I have towards him is undeniable. It feels like I‚Äôve known him forever and yet I know nothing about the guy. He feels the same.

We spent this last weekend together in Boston and when I went down the street to get a coffee I realized I‚Äôd been there before. 3 years ago I was driving through the city and was drawn to this spot. I knew I‚Äôd never been there before, but it felt significant at the time? Walking down the street this weekend I knew it was the same spot before I even turned the corner and it was confirmed. Freaked me out.

Later that night we had some drinks and got into a deep spiritual conversation. This new ability to communicate with the dead has been really weighing on me, so I vented about that and my step dad. Shortly after he starts talking about how much he loves the 3 stooges (my stepdads favorite) and then he put on the movie Planes Trains and Automobiles (also his favorite). He‚Äôs only 39 so those references were unusual. Really random, but the synchronicities of the day just overcame me and I started crying. I cried a lot actually. I feel this man is also intuitively gifted, he just hasn‚Äôt come to know his power yet.

The conversation went on for another hour or so with both of us venting before he suddenly went cold, so I called him on it. He looked me dead in the eyes and said ‚Äúyou scare me‚Äù. The deep talk was over after that and he got playful. I knew that was my signal to leave it alone, so I did.

The whole thing is overwhelming. He is a single dad, a widower. I‚Äôve gained so much weight this year I am so self-conscious, on top of just leaving a crappy relationship. We‚Äôre both scared, no idea what we‚Äôre doing we‚Äôre just doing it. Who is this man? Why am I pulled to this stranger?

We‚Äôve only known each other 2 weeks but he‚Äôs already casually brought up marriage. My experience with sociopaths tells me ‚Äúred flag, too soon he‚Äôs lying, run!‚Äù But these synchronicities, affirmations &amp; my intuition says otherwise. What gives?",1603849442.0

And i'm just gonna say this; i can't get out. I have tried every single method and way to do it. But no matter what i do or how many times, i just keep f*cking up. So now, i had an idea. I would write a 'contract' and sign it as a promise to the universe. I was very serious about quitting and still am. I even did tarot cards to ask for the universe's permission on this and everything. So yes, i wrote a contract to quit for this year and never masturbate again. The contract would end on december 31st 2020 (at the end ofnr his year). But here is the thing.. i said; if i break my promise/the contract (rules) you can break my arm. I literally put in there that if i would masturbate my arm would break. In a way of; hey universe help me out please and find a way to manifest me breaking my arm into my life. Yeah i know, some may see it as stupid, some smart and that it just ended badly, idk what you think of it.
BUT yesterday.. i relapsed. I never took so long deciding about yes or no. Would i do it or not? I just kept having the thought of the contract on my mind. I really didn't wanna have a broken arm. But the urge was so bad and i lost control. I relapsed. I regret it. The second i was done, the second i started, the second i decided to give up, anf the second i woke up today. I hate myself. And what now? Am i really going to break my arm? I know i made that 'rule' myself. But it scares me. No one wants to break their arm ofcourse. I expected to really not relapse and it went well for a very long time. It got me out of a crazy cycle of addiction where i couldn't wven get through half a day without relapsing. But here i am.
Scared, hating myself, regretting what i did, not knowing if i will break my damn arm. What do you guys think?
- will i break my arm or will i not?
- didn't the universe already know this could happen maybe?
- any idea on how i can heal my addiction in a spiritual way?

spirituality,Ego; why you so pessimistic?,"I was doing some reflecting on the nature of my Ego today and wanted to share what I've learned.

Often times when my Ego gets triggered it baits the mind into rumination traps &amp; worrying. If the Ego is triggered specifically by remembering a past event, it always seems to remember it in a way that is skewed from what really happened - it twists things into the worst ways possible and has no problem identifying with them as fact.

I am beginning to believe that the reason for this is because the Ego ""knows"" (through conditioning) that these exaggerated &amp; false things are the most likely to get a response from me and my conscious attention &amp; energy. As a result I fall into traps of trying to debate &amp; disprove the Ego, but from my experience it almost doesn't seem to understand the language of logic/reason. But the Ego thrives on the attention; it's existence depends on it.

The Ego is like a child who is acting-out for my attention. I work everyday to recondition myself &amp; the Ego by not responding to the tantrums it throws. I hope that in time I will see significant change on this front. For now, I am thankful that I can at least see what the Ego does and not be so lost in it.

spirituality,Being in the present moment vs. being fully present,"Being in the present moment, in the sense of your experience being focused on that, is easy. This world provides a lot of different opportunities for it, and most people can find something which grabs their attention like that. That can be really nice when it's a positive experience.

The associated attachments to sources of entertainment enabling the experience can have some costs and disadvantages. These can seem negligible  and okay. 

There is another important consideration: regarding being fully present. What you do to manipulate yourself into the present moment can make the experience escapist. You temporarily forget about your life and the world overall, and focus on the experience.

There are ways to experience the present moment without shutting out other awareness. It's like a lot more can fit into my mind at once then. It's like various awareness is out there, ready to be grasped if I want, but I'm just letting it be and not grasping.

This way of being is less dependent on having especially entertaining things to focus on. Instead it seems dependent on being true to myself. 

The compulsive drive to escape into thoughts, and the compulsive search for distraction and entertainment both seem to be a result of attempts to ignore or bury parts of myself. I dismiss some of my motivation instead of finding a way to express it into action, and then I'm driven towards activities which help counteract emotions associated with that motivation.

When that compulsive drive is reduced, and I'm in the present moment with a broader awareness and less effort to manipulate myself into that state, I would call that being more fully present. I am one with the parts which are ignored and suppressed when I'm seeking a more escapist present moment.

The broader awareness in that state creates a more vivid experience which really intuitively seems like being more present and more alive.

Sometimes a seemingly escapist way of being in the present moment can lead to a being more present state. I've seen this after watching movies, especially in a cinema.  I suspect that the main factor preventing me from being fully present is the effort put in to manipulate my state. Probably if a present moment experience becomes effortless, it tends towards being fully present. (I'm not talking about effort involved in accomplishing something external. That effort is okay. I've experienced very present states when putting in such effort. The effort directed towards just being in the present moment is what prevents being fully present.)",1604557705.0

If only decay could just decay away.

That'd be peaceful.

And yet there is peace. And happiness. And love.

spirituality,Feeling like I am trapped in my body?,"I‚Äôm not sure if this will be removed since it mentions psilocybin but the main point has to do with my spirit which is why I wanted to post this here instead of another sub. 

I‚Äôll try to keep it short as I am not great at being concise. I experienced a bad trip back in September. For a few weeks following that, I felt like I was a soul who was trapped in a body/mind, and like I really wanted to make it all stop. I came to the conclusion that I must have been embodying a spiritual awakening instead of just realizing something in my head and it was much scarier than I thought it would be? But then my brain is like well if it was scary then it wasn‚Äôt spiritual since fear only comes from ego??? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true... 

But anyway, I had this feeling that ‚ÄúI‚Äù wanted to just shoot out of my own head and up into the sky. That‚Äôs quite literally what it felt like. Like I was trapped in my body and I really wanted to get out. But I couldn‚Äôt figure out what this ‚ÄúI‚Äù feeling was since it wasn‚Äôt in my head. 

Also, when I would slow down and become mindful prior to the bad trip, I always felt calm. Now I feel like I just tune into all of my senses and it reminds me of the fact that I exist as a human and it almost makes me panic.

Is there something wrong with me? My thoughts are telling me I‚Äôm insane. I don‚Äôt believe my thoughts but I do consider them at times. I also doubt myself because this feels like something I‚Äôd read about in a spiritual book rather than experience firsthand‚Äîfeeling like a spirit and all. So my brain tells me I must be crazy. 

I‚Äôm only spiritual because of what mindfulness has done to me and realizing that I‚Äôm not my thoughts/emotions. But I‚Äôve never had any kind of otherworldly experience and I‚Äôm not clairvoyant or anything like that so I guess my brain is waiting for some sort of very clear experience to confirm my beliefs.

spirituality,I had a strange spiritual experience I can‚Äôt explain please help,"So I‚Äôll start this story by giving you a little background. My best friend Sarah is a spiritual person and had very recently told me that she has had premonitions several times throughout her life that ended up always coming true; she felt things coming on. She had never shared these with anyone before because they were dark and scary and she didn‚Äôt want anyone to think she was insane for having these thoughts. She couldn‚Äôt ever nail down exactly who or what the situation was but she‚Äôd get these overwhelming gut feelings she couldn‚Äôt shake. She once had a gut feeling that a family friend was going to come close to death, a few weeks later a family she grew up with rolled their car several times. Fortunately no one died but she‚Äôs had premonitions surrounding death before too. About a month ago she told me about all of her visions and that a new one had been recently overwhelming her. She knew someone tied specifically to a close friend of ours was going to pass away and that it would be an accident. Just a few days later, a childhood friend of the person she felt the death was tied to overdosed and passed away. I was grateful she had mentioned her premonition because in the past she had always been ashamed and felt crazy and that others would judge her for these visions. 
I am a spiritual person myself and I had recently invested in a set of tarot cards and the few readings I have given myself have been eerily spot on. She had never had her tarot read so last night we decided to do a 3 card ‚Äòwhat does your beginning middle and end of next week look like spread‚Äô and while the first 2 cards were spooky, her 3rd card was judgement reversed. This card literally says ‚Äúthe universe is trying to send you messages but you keep pretending like they don‚Äôt exist because you are afraid that others will judge you for them‚Äù... wtf. When we read this card we were in shock; the hairs on my neck stood straight up. After we got dinner with some friends me, Sarah and another girlfriend of ours, Ashley, decided to do another reading. We found a safe quiet room and were talking about how today was the day Ashley‚Äôs father had passed 2 years ago. She was obviously upset but she‚Äôs tough, I‚Äôd never seen her cry before tonight. She started talking about her dad then crying and Sarah sat in front of her on the floor and put her hands on Ashley‚Äôs face and over her heart on a pattern and just let Ashley cry. Sarah started crying and it was almost like she was taking the sorrow from Ashley, like she was ridding her of pain and she was feeling all of that sorrow herself. I ended up in tears because it just felt powerful and it was so intense. When Ashley had cried herself out, Sarah came over to me. I‚Äôve also been in somewhat of a depression myself so i think Sarah wanted to see if she could pull some of my negative energy out as well. I‚Äôm open minded but I had no idea what to expect or what was about to come. She placed her hand on my forehead, cheeks and several points on my chest with pressure and I started crying. She kept moving her hands and breathing deeply then at one point had her hands over my heart and said something along the lines of ‚Äúthere is so much pain‚Äù and she began to cry, I could almost feel her literally pulling my energy out of my body and taking it all on at once herself. She kept doing this and we kept crying. I think harder than I have ever cried in my life. My eyes were shut for a while and my body felt like it was vibrating; I was trembling. I can‚Äôt explain how intense this feeling was. But when I finally opened my eyes everything was green. Like a green filter had been put over my eyes. Like I was looking through a big green glass bottle. I knew where I was and everything looked how I‚Äôd always seen it but everything was all a deep, emerald green. I was terrified. I froze and I felt like I was paralyzed and I kept shouting ‚Äúwhy is it green!? Why is everything green!?‚Äù It made NO sense and I still don‚Äôt understand. I wanted it to stop. I was so scared I shut my eyes tight again hoping things would change back but they weren‚Äôt. Sarah kept trying to pull this energy out of me and knew I was terrified. We finally started to calm down after a few minutes and when I opened my eyes again the green had finally started to fade. Eventually I left my eyes open and the green completely faded out and then everything began to look warm and golden. I got up trembling and felt like I would be sick. They both helped me to the bathroom where I dry heaved for a while, trying to figure out what the fuck just happened to me and my vision and grateful that things weren‚Äôt permanently green like how I was genuinely worried that they might be for a moment there. I was shaking and scared afterwards but I felt safe and light. I felt like cleansed in a way I can‚Äôt quite explain. Has anyone had an experience similar to this? Can anyone explain what happened to my vision? Sarah and I have been thinking that she may have opened my heart chakra which is green and is of self growth and love which is exactly what I‚Äôm experiencing in my life right now too. I have never done research on chakras, how to open them, or anything even close to that nature but I‚Äôm not sure what else my seeing green could possibly mean. I‚Äôm traumatized and shaken up but today I feel light and at peace. I just wish I could find an explanation for what I experienced. Thanks I‚Äôm advance for any advice and thanks for reading my traumatizing and enlightening experience. 

 TLDR; I think my friend exorcised me and my vision turned green and I have no idea how the fuck to explain any of it. HELP.",1603592366.0
spirituality,Growing your intuition,"My journey of growing my intuition started with a an image in my head I got while in university that showed me a teen that had been kidnapped. The police were still looking for her and when I saw the missing poster I got an image in my head of her bound with her hair cut off. Wow it freaked me out! The experience of it was intense. When they found her they revealed those details in the media. After that I noticed thoughts would pop in about certain people and they‚Äôd call or stop by. I didn‚Äôt really actively work on growing my intuition till several years later. I read books about energy, spirit guides, and took my level 1 reiki.

spirituality,When shit gets rough.,"Hey loves!

I feel like a lot of people, myself included, sometimes only get spiritual when things go wrong. 

A lot of us have replaced prayers with manifestations, a wrathful god with a more generous attentive one. 

Don‚Äôt get spiritual to make your current life better, be spiritual because that‚Äôs innately how you are.

You absolutely deserve happiness and all the good things. But when they don‚Äôt come to fruition, don‚Äôt put the blame like yourself because that‚Äôs a lot like religion. 

The truth is more often than not, you, as a human being, are not in control of what will happen to you.

This life you‚Äôve been given depends a lot on the circumstances that happen to you. Sometimes you won‚Äôt be able to make things better.

What you can do however, regardless of what happens to you, is to allow yourself to accept your feelings, frustrations, and even the negative feelings and thoughts, don‚Äôt act on them, but accept that the current you, the human you, is in fact another mammal with a primate brain! 

We‚Äôre here to experience that. So, you don‚Äôt have to be divine, or transcend something that‚Äôs very unique, and frankly, absolutely bananas! We‚Äôre here for all of it. The sadness, the anger, the cringe moments, and the positivity, the happiness, all the ups and downs.

If you are able to feel these things, well, you‚Äôre a human, what you came here to be. Don‚Äôt for a second think that‚Äôs bad. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs very painful, sometimes very sweet. Sometimes you want out, sometimes you don‚Äôt wanna let it go. 

All of it, however it may be, is your experience and that‚Äôs something to be proud of.

I am learning that the Divine sends us messages in many forms, including through others.

spirituality,There is great freedom in willingly accepting your personal 'worst case scenario',"I've come to realise the absolute freedom in willingly accepting my greatest fears as factual.
 
If you fear the end of a relationship, are you able to accept that all relationships are temporary?

Most people say their greatest fear is death. Can you, in this moment, accept that physical death is inevitable for all of us? That you're never going to escape that? That putting off accepting it is not going to make it easier to deal with as it approaches?

For whatever reason, my greatest fear was not being loved by others. This took me a while but I have accepted that my fear is indeed a reality. Who could they even have possibly loved? The image I was projecting? The image they built up of my by themselves?

I too have had the illusion of loving other people. We had no idea who we even were! We loved an image, an idea. 

*Important note: This is not to say love doesn't exist. I believe it to be the fabric of life. It's the version of 'us' I'm contesting.*

The mind will likely believe that considering these scenarios and merging with the feelings that come with, as highly dangerous. Because we built the 'ego'  to protect us from suffering.

The truth is that the real suffering is in living in fear of the inevitable. Much better to shed the burden now and then peacefully go about your life, free from delusion.

Notice what remains, even as you go through this painful process. You do!

Feel those feelings and realise that they are just feelings. However intense. Don't be a prisoner to the inevitabilities of living as a human being.

spirituality,How to find peace in the midst of trauma/crisis,"I'm on the verge of being homeless, and I'm starting to accept that this is the end. Being evicted with no income and no support system is basically a death sentence. I live in a state where winters can get brutal. I have to find a new home for my cats, which feels unbearable. Still, in spite of what an utter disaster that my life is, I feel the need to go deeper into conciousness. But how does one fully live in the present when one is penniless and homeless? It feels impossible.
 
I was caregiver to my mom before she passed away in March 2020. When she first became ill, I had been laid off from my job, so I decided to use that time to look after my mom at least until we knew exactly how serious her condition was. Her illness progressed rapidly, leaving her 100% bed-ridden. It was clear she needed round the clock care, but placing her in a facility was too terrifying for us, not to mention too expensive (for even a half-decent place). So I took care of her at home, hoping her doctors would finally get to the bottom of her condition. She was in and out of hospital for a while, and then covid hit and she passed fairly quickly. As I was unemployed, we were living only on her income; as soon as she passed, the income disappeared. And as we were in the first wave of the pandemic, I wasn't having much luck finding a new job. I received unemployment benefits, but that didn't last very long. I fell behind on rent so I had to use the majority of unemployment to pay the landlord. Then I fell behind again after UE ran out, and the lease has expired. The landlord is selling the house so I am being forced out in 9 days. So here I sit, paralyzed by the horror of having to give/throw away my and mom's possessions. I will only be able to take what I can carry as I embark on my homeless journey. I'm still stunned that this can happen, but I'm slowly starting to accept it. I am an educated, experienced worker who has been condemned to live on the street. I have no children so I do not qualify for any government assistance, other than food stamps. All summer, I sold pretty much everything of value, so I am at THE bottom of the barrel. Everything I've known is or will soon be gone. I have very few family left and none of them can help me anyway. Friends are few and scattered, and are dealing with their own problems due to covid.

But I don't want to hand my power back over to my ego and give in to self-pity. I've done that too many times in my life, which is probably a big reason why I find myself in this endless nightmare. I want to just be done. My heart feels so heavy and I have to force myself to take deep breaths throughout each day. I'm not able to sleep, and the stress is causing both physical and emotional damage. That's because my ego is calling the shots. One thing I'm not allowing my ego to do is to embrace the notion that this situation is anyone's fault but mine. I made the choices that led me here, no one else. 

I'm looking for some guidance on how I can maintain clarity thru this experience, how I can open up to receive divine guidance. Meditation has been a challenge since receiving the court order that I have to leave my home by a specific date. Not surprisingly, this date makes the reality of my circumstances that much more terrifying. It truly feels like a death sentence, but I dont want it to feel that way and I'm not sure how to go about transcending the fear of what awaits me. To those who have overcome similar dire circumstances, how did you do it?  I am lost, very frightened and exhausted. How can I possibly come back from this?

In biological domain, Shiva is the consciousness. Uma are our thought potentials and durgA is the kinetic actions. Breaking the thought barriers and executing actions is the appearance of durgA that drives away powerful (mahiSa) yet non-evolving (asura) characteristics.

spirituality,something to keep in mind,"i‚Äôve been thinking about this for quite a while now. the ebb and flow of life as a human is fascinating and beautiful. sure, there is chaos and madness at times. on the other hand, miracles, synchronicities, and bizzare but beautiful experiences happen everywhere at any time. the best part about not being able to know what will happen in your future, is that ANYTHING amazing could happen to you at any time! in 2 hours, you could make a small decision that will lead to other decisions that could bring you something wonderful later. you could get a major business idea tomorrow that would bring you financial security. in 4 days the love of your life could be standing in front of your face and you could meet them for the first time, not even knowing how big of an impact they will have on your life. in a week, if you‚Äôre trying for a baby, you could find out you‚Äôre pregnant. in a month, someone could introduce you to the best friend of your entire life. in two months, someone could bring you an opportunity that will change your world for the better. it could happen right now, for all we know! it‚Äôs just so exciting to know that at any time, we can be turning the corner to a miracle and not even know it yet.",1603913108.0

spirituality,Convincing Oneself of Reincarnation,"Only a few months ago, I would have viewed the likelihood of reincarnation to be utter rubbish. However, for whatever reason, I find I am becoming more open-minded as of late. I am an atheist, and one who historically believed in eternal oblivion upon death, and the complete cessation of consciousness. That being said, I am aware now that eternal oblivion is not a great explanation either, nor is there really any evidence for it (besides what many scientists believe). I have begun reading the book ‚ÄòLife Before Life‚Äô by Jim Tucker. I find it quite interesting so far, but I need more convincing. Is there such a thing as ‚Äònon-religious‚Äô belief in reincarnation? I am not claiming I suddenly believe in religion (I do not), but I am open to the idea that the world is perhaps not all material. Can one be an atheist whilst still believing in reincarnation?

I also find the likelihood of anyone living at all very interesting, considering the age of the world and the sum of all humans that have ever lived (apparently estimated at over 100 billion). If there is only one life and then nonexistence for another trillion years, what are the chances that anyone even lives in the first place at any one time? Wouldn‚Äôt it be extremely unlikely that I would have even been born considering this?",1603804838.0
spirituality,AN URGENT MESSAGE for all US residents (AND the REST OF THE WORLD as well!),"*A quick disclaimer before I begin:* **The following post has** ***NOTHING*** **to do with politics and** ***EVERYTHING*** **to do with** ***spirituality.*** And once you read it, you WILL most certainly ‚Äúget it‚Äù here as well. Cheers.  

---  

**TL;DR:** The outcome of the ongoing US elections will affect ALL HUMANITY whether they like it or *not.* So DO join us all in the global meditation for setting up Divine Governance in the US (and everywhere else!) --- **a meditation that seeks to FORCE a** ***DIVINELY INSPIRED OUTCOME*** **for the HIGHEST BENEFIT OF** ***ALL LIVING BEINGS*** as opposed to electing some specific person or party. **This** [**Mass Global Meditation (click here for its instructions)**](https://old.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/ji2ajf/an_urgent_planetary_meditation_for_setting_up/) **will take place on the 29th of October, 2020, at 11:11 AM, Pacific Daylight Time** [**(CLICK HERE to quickly check the timing conversions for your local Time Zone),**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Global+Mass+Meditation+for+establishing+Global+Divine+Governance&amp;iso=20201029T111111&amp;p1=137) though you all are **HIGHLY ADVISED TO KEEP DOING THIS** *whenever you so get the time for doing this* hereafter. Even sparing but a couple of minutes each day hereon will do WONDERS for the outcome of not just THIS election, but so much *more.* Finally, here's some [**IRREFUTABLE PROOF**](https://v.redd.it/sp7i3xwqkhu51) that **DIVINE TRANSFORMATION** on such lines is **ALREADY AFOOT** (even as you read this text), and, as such, isn't exactly a *fairy tale dream.* As also some [**IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE**](https://old.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/hgzroy/i_promised_to_show_you_all_irrefutable_evidence/) of the fact that all of this *""mass meditation stuff""* stuff truly, *really,* ***WORKS.*** 
 

[**A YET ANOTHER EPIC-ALLY additional way that you can use to serve and support the planet and its people at this time**](https://sananda.website/peggy-black-and-the-team-september-18th-2020/). *And* [***YET ANOTHER ONE!!!***](https://eraoflight.com/2020/10/04/sula-your-5d-power-creates-3d-change/)  

---  

**Main Message Begins...**  

While this message (in particular) is primarily intended for US citizens alone, let me assure ONE and ALL in here that **the contents of this message affect EVERY SINGLE PERSON who is incarnate upon planet Earth** right now. So EVERY SINGLE PERSON is well advised to read this, and take the appropriate ACTION that gets inspired within them as a result of this.  

This message is about the ongoing US Elections, and before anyone objects to putting such a message out in a *‚Äúspiritual‚Äù* forum such as this one, let me firstly assure you that **this message is** ***VERY MUCH related to*** **the Spiritual Life Blueprints of** ***EVERY BEING INCARNATE UPON PLANET EARTH*** **right** ***now;*** AS ALSO does it contain ZERO political messaging, side-taking, party-preferences, controversial stuff, or absolutely ANYTHING of that sort. But you ALL will have to *read it first* to *""get it!""*  

---  

**Here‚Äôs the basic gist of it:** The United States of America, for better or for worse, has for long been **THE** center of all political, military, and every other kind of imaginable and unimaginable kind of POWER for quite sometime now. Power, that has been VASTLY misused for dark and disturbing and *unspeakably* nefarious purposes, and very much so INCLUDING the suppression of spiritual people ALL ACROSS OUR PLANET. That includes you. That includes me. And that well includes *every single person* you‚Äôve ever come across within this lifetime of yours. And which is why, **the outcome of THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION (during the time of planetary ascension no less) will affect ALL PEOPLE ON PLANET EARTH** whether they ***LIKE IT or NOT.*** Which is why **YOU,** each and every single one of YOU, needs to have a SAY and a VOICE and a VOTE in the outcome of this election. No, not a political voice or vote (necessarily); but more so an ENERGETIC one of truly BENEVOLENT and DIVINE intentions and proportions that manifest the HIGHEST of outcomes for the ENTIRE PLANET at large --- all through **manifesting the HIGHEST of divine outcomes** for this particular election in question, here.  

---  

Now, I‚Äôm well aware that elections and votes are a scam, and that ALL of our true (spiritual and other) powers lie only and ONLY **WITHIN** ourselves at all times. And yet, for the MAJORITY of (the unawakened) human populace, such is so not TRUE, at least for *now.* So before they all come to the point of being entirely SELF-DEPENDENT spiritually (i.e. zero dependency upon outside leaders, governments, etc.) their COLLECTIVE ENERGIES (in the form of their *‚Äúvotes‚Äù)* WILL nevertheless get manipulated still by those of lesser-light, in order that *they too* may be able to meet their own dark and nefarious ends in here. And it is ***VERY MUCH SO*** our divine role and responsibility and HONOUR here, as spiritually *awakened* beings upon this planet right now, to so **NOT** allow that to happen here now, ***NO MATTER WHAT.*** They can censor our voices (that too, *barely);* but **how in the world will they** ***EVER*** **be able to censor** our inner **POWER?** (Hint: They simply ***CANNOT).*** 
 

---  

**Which is why I‚Äôm so NOT going to ask you to manifest the victory of** ***so-and-so political party*** **or** ***such-and-such presidential candidate*** **in here.** Instead, I am going to merely ask ONE AND ALL to **ENVISION, INTEND, VISUALIZE and MANIFEST the HIGHEST POSSIBLE** ***DIVINE*** **OUTCOME** for this election (of global impact and proportions). Or what one could call a *‚ÄúDivinely Inspired Government‚Äù,* so to speak. Because it‚Äôs NOT about WHO it is that you vote into power ultimately, but more so, WHAT ENERGIES you choose to represent as / through THEM. **Voting a party or a person is doomed to fail.** Voting an ENERGY and a SPECIFIC INTENT, that can [**NEVER, EVER,** ***EVER,*** **FAIL.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/hgzroy/i_promised_to_show_you_all_irrefutable_evidence/)  

---  

So, how do you even *go about* doing this sort of stuff? It is very, **very, simple,** really. Imagine / Visualize and INTEND that the OUTCOME of the elections leads to a government of *‚ÄòDivine Servants‚Äô* being installed. You can visualize these divine servants as being BEINGS OF LIGHT, or Angels, or God, or Saints, or *whatever-visualization-cue* works for you. **You could even visualize** ***yourself*** in here, **if** ***that's*** **whom you trust the** ***MOST.*** Kindly note here that the *‚Äúvisuals‚Äù,* *‚Äúimages‚Äù*, *‚Äúimaginations‚Äù,* or *representations* that you choose here don‚Äôt really matter *ONE DAMN BIT* --- but only and ***ONLY*** the INTENT / ENERGY that those visuals of your liking convey, carry, contain and *EMBODY* do.  

---  

**Imagine / Visualize and INTEND that these beings (the** ***president*** **and the people under him) carry and contain** ***ALL*** **qualities that you associate with the** ***HIGHEST OF THE HIGH*** --- namely, **true benevolence, compassion, kindness, understanding, WISDOM, forgiveness, TRUTHFULNESS, transparency, PEACE, balance,** ***service-to-ALL*** **and, most important of them all,** ***UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.*** You can add in more such amazing qualities further if you so wish, it is ALL UPTO YOU. Because yes, folks, you are, indeed, ***THAT INCREDIBLY POWERFUL,*** here. 
 

Now, **what if you absolutely SUCK AT visualizing or imagining things?** **Worry** ***NOT.*** For the **trick to manifestation** is ***FEELING.*** And more so, ***FEELING*** **as if what you‚Äôve desired is** ***ALREADY HERE,*** right here right now right in FRONT OF YOU no less. *And repeatedly doing this as often as you possibly can throughout your days.* Visualization / Imagination is just a support wheel for you, so to speak. For **it is** ***ONLY*** **the** ***INTENTION*** **and** ***FEELING*** **that really even** ***matters*** in the end. So even if you can INTEND and FEEL as if the outcome of your choice has already HAPPENED, and then let go of it with the **FAITH** (in your own divine power) that ***IT IS SO,*** folks, you‚Äôre (WAY MORE THAN!) good to go in here. Finally, **IF AT ALL you even suck at setting intentions,** ***JUST send in your PRAYERS*** to your Higher Self or God or Angels or your favourite Saint or Spiritual Guru or whoever else *works-for-you.* Remember, ***YOUR PRAYERS are INFINITELY MORE POWERFUL*** than what you‚Äôd ever be led to believe. So yeah, go do just *THAT* if nothing else (works)!  

---  


**With this, you become** ***ETERNALLY FREE*** **from** ***EVER*** **having to make the tricky and confusing choices between** ***‚Äúgood‚Äù*** **candidates and** ***‚Äúbad‚Äù*** **candidates.** Between *X political party* and *Y political party.* And between *all else* that leads to separation, confusion, anxiety and whatnot. Even if you‚Äôre voting in person, do this exercise and vote for whichever candidate *‚Äúfeels‚Äù* right to vote for (in just *that* given moment). ***THAT‚ÄôS*** **your** ***'Divine Inspiration.'*** AKA your *intuition,* or your *gut-feeling,* or your *higher divine guidance,* so to speak. (Also, one that is ALWAYS right). And, just in case you are *not* voting or *not even* a US citizen, **THIS IS HOW** you‚Äôre voting for a better world (and doing this in a *whole lot more* efficient, faster and smooth-er way) regardless. Because, as I said earlier, the spiritual fate of the ENTIRE PLANET hangs in balance now, with respect to the OUTCOME of this specific election. Not that a bad outcome will ""ruin everything"" or such; but that it can potentially delay a LOT of progress for an unnecessarily long time really. Which is so NOT worth it, in here.  

---  

**Also, once you‚Äôre done doing this,** ***PAY ZERO HEED*** to news articles (proclaiming the (pre) supposed victory of X candidate or Y party) or (fake AF) *‚Äúexit polls‚Äù* or *what-else-have-you!* Remember, ***YOU*** **are the WHOLE AND SOUL CREATOR of your own reality.** Everything else is but lies and deception and *propaganda.* **DO** ***NOT*** fall for it. Have FAITH in your own, divine ***SELF.*** *TRUST* in your own power to change the world. Because you have it and ***I KNOW THAT YOU VERY WELL SO DO.***  

Last (but by no means the least), ***FEEL FREE to use this EXACT SAME METHOD*** (of setting up Divine Governance) ***in your current place of stay as well,*** no matter which country or political setup you‚Äôre currently living under in, at this very moment! Because **this method QUITE LITERALLY SO** ***FORCES*** **your chosen leaders** to either FIT COMPLETELY (within the DIVINE template / blueprint of working, governing, and doing things) or simply **NOT** be a part of the said governing systems and setups in question ***AT ALL.*** Because yes, this method IS indeed **THAT** powerful, dearest folks.  

---  

**Two final concluding things:** One, if anyone‚Äôs interested in setting this intention on a *COLLECTIVE LEVEL,* **PLEASE DO JOIN the Mass Meditation for this exact purpose** that has been **organized at 11:11 AM Pacific Daylight Time on the 29th of October, 2020.** [**CLICK HERE to get a time zone conversion for this for your respective place/s of residence.**](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Global+Mass+Meditation+for+establishing+Global+Divine+Governance&amp;iso=20201029T111111&amp;p1=137)

spirituality,[URGENT] Calling everyone capable to assist German politicians,"On Wednesday November 18th in the morning, the German parliament ( ""Bundestag"" in Berlin) will accept or reject a law that is capable to strip German people of nearly all their basic and human rights.

The law has been made to protect everyone in a case of a pandemic, yet the aforementioned possibilities are there in the text.

So this is a call to everyone capable, to connect to their Energy, Deity, channel, light, source etc. and ask them to help the  politicians to make the right decision on Wednesday! A decision for the higher good of all beings! Include it in a Ritual, a Puja, a Meditation a Prayer or whatever comes to you.

Thanks a lot in advance! \_/\\\_

Please spread this information as wide as possible, for the media coverage is astonishingly small yet and the more attention that flows towards Berlin the better it may all work out.

**Important**: This is no call to use magick, we do not want to manipulate the minds or the will of those involved! We do just ask the source, to enlighten them and open their eyes to what the right decision is

This year also did get really hard for me in terms of my mental health and my OCD that was always pretty well managed got to such a bad point that I was unable to complete my daily activities. I‚Äôve been on an SNRI for about a month now and I‚Äôm functioning so much better. My only question is, is being on thIs SNRI going to serve as a blockage to me completing my spiritual awakening? 

I really hoped I would be able to find happiness and self-love and cure my OCD through becoming more in tune with my true self, but it reached a point that became so unbearable that I had to seek professional help. I really want to continue on this spiritual journey, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never really be able to find my true self and connect with my psychic abilities and spirit guides while taking a medication that alters the chemicals in my brain.

Flow is a constant. We dream, we heal, we are reborn everyday by ourselves only to be proved as a creator though we're pretending not be for eternity. 

Observers from now, we travellers will dream like never before as we are aligned by the manifestation power.

Child, look within and develop yourself. Have you found your vision quest or the purpose of your existence? How can you navigate this quantum dreamspace without holding onto the divine? If your biological brain hallucinates your perception, where is your faith?
It is a sign of things to be as they are not as you desire. Imagine a summoning of what could be. We must organize our energy to fulfill others as the extension of self.

Consciousness consists of infinite-dimensional superstructures of quantum energy. It can be an ennobling of the universal self. Peace is the deeper meaning of understanding, and of us. The universe is overflowing with atomic ionization.

The metamorphosis of coreless happiness is now happening as a form of materialistic duality.

Where there is meaningless suffering, divine fulfillment cannot thrive. Without cosmic intuition, one cannot reflect inwardly despite the illusion of perceived effort. Discontinuity of self is the antithesis of the illusion of hope.",1605128018.0

spirituality,Inclusion of spirituality in the current education system!,"I have been thinking on this since last few days.

If we don't train our children for these qualities how can we expect the world will be in a peace later in the future. 

We are teaching our children how to be competitive, strong, getting good grades and countless other things. Which makes them better machine in the future but not a better human being! This world needs more human beings than just machines. 

Who will teach them the WISDOM? Who will teach them value of PEACE? Every school should teach children the benefit of meditation. We understand these once we grow up and we think if we had been taught these concepts at an early age it would have given us significant benefits.

Once child's mind is programmed for these qualities, then I think we can say world is going in a right direction.",1604908820.0

spirituality,"How can I deal with my somewhat condescending, conservative and very Christian family I am living with?","Hi everyone - I've been part of this community for a while now and genuinely seek insight from this group. Earlier this year, I got much closer to myself spiritually, and started practicing meditation, ventured out into learning other religions' philosophies such as Hinduism and Buddhism (I grew up Christian, but many times the church's' teachings just didn't sit right with me), and recently gave up eating meat (very traumatic incident). Now I lost my job shortly after the COVID lockdown hit and had my aunt and uncle here in the States (my parents live abroad) offered for me to live with them out of state, which I graciously accepted. I was able to get another job fortunately to work remotely the same week they offered for me to live with them so I decided I would do so for a while and not have to sign another lease if I didn't need to for a while (I was in a very expensive city) and save up for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, though I'm more than grateful for their hospitality on allowing me to stay with them for a few months and offer me food and to use their car, they're very backwards and I feel my energy sometimes draining being with them for too long something I recently didn't even know I could really pick up on. They're very Christian (religious, not spiritual) and from a third world country (where we come from there is a very colonized mentality) and see almost anything outside of Christianity as 'weird'. They're also both doctors and have that mentality that if you're not a doctor, lawyer or engineer, which I am none, you're deemed somewhat of a failure. I felt these condescending ,and passive comments come in very heavily as I came to move in with them, and they would pass somewhat snark remarks about my degree not really being worth it (the industry I worked in was heavily impacted by the pandemic), which is/was very upsetting to me, because I know my life purpose happens to deal with doing work in this field. Even their 10 year old commented about me being unemployed when I first came, so why should he listen to me, which really hurt (and I guess says a lot about how they talk to their kids at home). They also think its weird of me when I do not want to eat meat anymore, when I meditate or when I simply talk about certain philosophies which are outside the realm of the conservative, Christian, work-my-life-away 9-5 mindset they have. They're always blasting the news and asking me about my opinions on politics, which quite frankly, I don't even care about, then they'll say I know nothing about politics (I don't care about it, but just feel they always want to rain on my parade or bring down my mood).

This reality, right here, right now.","""Now  I am getting to the edge, to the point of very quiet despair, to  realization that it‚Äôs too confusing, I cant reach it, I cant! Maybe I  should just let go of this Nirvana thing and go about my life with all  of it‚Äôs complications‚Äù.

What  is this ‚Äúnirvana thing‚Äù? It is a dream, an idea, a fantasy. What is  this ""my life with all of its complications‚Äù? It is the reality. The  daily reality of a human existence.

How  can one possibly realize the true nature of reality by ignoring the  daily reality of one‚Äôs existence and, instead, clinging to a fantasy? A  dream?

How?

And yet the idea persists, the idea that the fantasy is a reality, and the reality is an illusion.

But it isn‚Äôt, and it isn‚Äôt.

The  path to realizing the true nature of reality leads through reality.  This reality, right here, right now. This reality called illusion, this  self that supposedly doesn‚Äôt exist, this ego that apparently is a  figment of the imagination. This reality that one experiences, oneself  as one experiences oneself. This is what one needs to be fully present  with, fully aware of, because this is the only reality one has. The only  real one, the only tangible one.

When  one is the mind, the ego, the body, the person, then that is what one  is. That is the only ‚Äúoneself‚Äù one can possibly be aware of, present to.  Not some imaginary spiritual consciousness something-or-other, not some  fantastical ‚Äúoneness‚Äù, not ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. Only who one is, what one is,  right now. That is what one has to be present to. That is what one needs  to be present to: what is. Right here. Right now.

The  judging game is one of the mind‚Äôs favorites. Take any experience,  separate it from other experiences and then classify it as real or  illusory, then judge it as right or wrong, then either cling to it  desperately or try to get rid of it. The spiritual game of chasing  nirvana, the spiritual game of calling the ""life with all of its  complications‚Äù an illusion, unreal, and trying to get away from it,  disconnected from it, set oneself apart from it - that‚Äôs all a mind  game. That is how the mind sees, it is how the mind relates, it is how  the mind operates.

When  one‚Äôs mind is what one is then naturally this is what one will do, and  yet one can be aware of oneself, therefore one can alter how one  functions. One can modify one‚Äôs reactions. When one is present with  oneself as one is, as the mind, one can see clearly what one is doing.  One can be aware of one‚Äôs mind and recognize it‚Äôs games. When one  recognizes the mind‚Äôs games, one can choose to play a different game. A  game that is not aligned with how the mind functions. A game that is  aligned with how reality functions.

This  is the game reality plays: in reality, everything is. Everything is  precisely what it is. Not better, not worse, not real or unreal, not  illusory or whatever else: it is. Whatever it is - it is that.

One  can choose to play the reality game. If one is aware of oneself, if one  is aware of one‚Äôs mind, if one is aware of one‚Äôs ego, one can chose to  not do whatever the mind wants to do to what is, and be present with  what is instead. Be present with reality as it is, not as the mind  defines and judges it to be. Be present with reality as it is, not as  the mind imagines it could be, might be, should be.

Be present with what is.

Being  present with oneself as one is - mind, ego, whathaveyou - IS being  present with reality as it is. Presence tends to expand, when exercised.  Awareness tends to deepen when one chooses to be aware, when one pays  attention to something one tends to see that something in greater  detail, more fully, more completely. When one is present with reality as  it is, chances are one will begin to experience reality deeper, in a  greater detail, more fully, more completely, and being present with  reality as it is, fully and completely, is this nirvana that everyone so  longs for.

The  path to nirvana leads through the mind, not away from the mind. The  path to nirvana leads through the ego, not away from the ego. The path  to nirvana leads through the everyday life with all of its  complications, not away from it and through a spiritual fantasy land.",1604162768.0

spirituality,Can I heal?,"Hii,
I already posted a few weeks back but I am having a rough time and would like a few more opinions. Some fear started in March and led me to feel empty inside. I then accidentally dissolved my ego structure, like ego death, which I think explains why when I went on meds they didn‚Äôt work. Since April things have gotten a ton worse- more empty, miserable, fragmented, dissociated, antisocial.
I had a psychotic break in 2018 which left me a bit empty and dissociated,  but meds worked and after ten months of healing, my heart blossomed open.
I am looking to have this happen again. A few weeks ago my heart opened the most it‚Äôs been open since May- I saw the beauty in the world, felt social, was laughing, felt somewhat connected to my body and to others. But it didn‚Äôt last because fear comes back and retraumatizes me.
I just don‚Äôt know how I can make it to total surrender. Also because of ego death my breathing is now manual-worriesome because when my heart opened in 2018 it was from becoming aware of the breath and entering an egoless state. Now my ego is operating on overdrive.

spirituality,Shadow Working - And How we can evolve with our Shadow Self,"All transcendence is Alchemical.

Just like a blacksmith places the iron or steel in his fire pit in order to shape it into his liking, it's the same reason why the Universe (G-d) throws you in the pit, or the Belly of the Beast. It triggers us to our extreme and reveals all our weakest, most terrifying points. From they're, our divine purpose and direction is shaped.

Individual feelings of melancholy, lamenting, and anxiety are usually correlated with depression. They‚Äôre short term. But an existential feeling of despair and grievance is most often a Dark Night of the Soul. An individual must be shown off with their most loneliest, isolated, hated self in order to truly reveal their own shadow and overcome it. That involves carrying it around you, and not letting what you may call ""The light"" blind you from it.

Our Shadow is part our Wholeness, and our Wholeness is what makes us Holy. Shadow working consists of actually revealing ourselves (to ourselves) for who we are as **INDIVIDUAL BEINGS**. It's the authenticity of your individual self which has been tainted by societies dichotomous illusion of duality, or ""good &amp; evil,"" and ""right &amp; wrong."" The scoldings from your parents, the punishments from schools, the restrictions from religions or faith, and the enforcement from laws.

Whatever you're too afraid to do, whatever you're afraid to speak, or whatever you're afraid to practice or express. It all becomes repressed into your subconscious level if there's fear, guilt, or punishment from society that deter you from acting. This later turns you against yourself, projecting your guilt and insecurities onto other individuals, or even public figures and entities. Wherever you find that ‚ÄúEvil self‚Äù outside of you, you seek after it and hunt it. In turn, it ruins your self esteem to the point you find hedonistic, indulgent, loathing, and depraved alternatives to help you cope with your suffering.

Start with little things such as working on this self esteem by being good to yourself. Meditate and ground yourself. Eat and drink healthy. Journal your thoughts. Start by not hating the person you've become. Start by not destroying yourself with cheap dopamine rushes and keeping yourself distracted with artificial relationships. 

Give yourself space to heal your wounds and figure out why you can be thankful for where you are at the moment. Find a proper therapist or psychologist to speak about your problems and have someone analyse them for you. From there you'll figure out ways you can be aware of that inner beast you allow to spit in every corner and become a master over your demons.

Any negligence of the self for some New Age ""Light and Love,"" and ""Oneness"" is not shadow working, but spiritual and existential bypassing. It is clinging you back to the Manipulative and Collective Matrix you may have thought you're getting away from.

spirituality,Being an individual.,"There is no scientifically proven way to be happy.   I mean, there's psychology, and I won't deny that it could have some benefits.  But what in the world has psychology given us, in the grand scheme of things? It's given us a society doped out on antidepressants, which elects a guy like Donald Trump and views an idiot like Joe Biden as the savior.  Psychology has done nothing for us.

And don't get me started on organized religion.  Millennia of genocides, condemnation, witch hunts, war.  Religion has done nothing for us.

Spirituality?  Maybe a bit more.  But nobody has been able to manifest World Peace with their worldwide group meditations or Law of Attraction.

And that's because there is no key to happiness.  Happiness is a great mystery.  All you can do is follow your heart and trust your direct experience.  Sure, you can learn from others, but you will never be fulfilled by being a copy cat.  Because if anything, it's an art, not a science.  And art can never be pinned down, especially not in such a way that applies to all of humanity.

Happiness, as far as I can tell, is a deeply personal thing.  It only comes from being deeply true to yourself as an individual.  Without fear.

I am quite critical of some people on here.  I mean, if you say to me ""the Earth is flat"", I will be critical.  Just like if you say ""I manifested my perfect partner by writing a list and keeping it in my bedroom closet"". I will be critical of that, too. To me, it's foolishness.

But you know what?  That's my business.  What I think of it need not have any bearing on you.  So ignore me if you wish.  What do I know about you and your life?

So despite my criticism of many folks and beliefs, deep down, I would like to encourage everyone to be true to themselves, and to be true to their heart.  Because this is the only way I have found which allows me to experience deep, fulfilling peace and happiness.

spirituality,Where Are We Going?," 

Hi y'all. I really appreciate this community's ability to dissect complex ideas and given the state of the world I thought maybe a conversation about our culture‚Äôs path could be interesting.

**So, Where Are We Going?**

I think we're all well aware that humanity is at a strange and precarious turning point in our collective journey. We seem to have arrived at the end of an epoch, of a specific way of Being in the World, and now we need to alter our path or risk destruction. Our previous path was one of exploration and domination, there was a world out there to venture into. Civilizations thrust themselves outward, expanding, conquering, and evolving rapidly. The story of linear progress made sense here, there was the opportunity for seemingly infinite growth.

But now, we‚Äôve spread ourselves over the entire world. The myths that drove us for centuries don‚Äôt seem to be working anymore. In fact, they seem to be causing a lot of the problems we‚Äôre seeing arise in the world. Climate crisis, authoritarianism, social isolation and inequality; so many of the issues we face can be traced back to an imbalance in our relationship with others and with the world, and this imbalance stems from outdated worldviews. I think we need to speak a new story into being, we need to take control of the narrative we‚Äôre living our lives by, because the consequences of unexamined cultural perspectives seem to be a blind sprint towards a cliff.

Below I‚Äôm going to explore the direction I feel our culture to be shifting in, framing these concepts in dualistic poles as I think that will highlight the state we‚Äôre currently in as well as the direction we need to head towards if we want to return to humanity‚Äôs homeostasis.

**Masculinity (Progress and Independence - Externally Driven) and Femininity (Conservation and Community ‚Äì Inwardly Drawn)**

It seems more and more apparent to me that a return to our relationship with feminine energy is part of what‚Äôs needed to heal our society. Part of the feminine archetype that I think is called for is that of the homemaker; rather than going off in the world and conquering new lands, we need to appreciate and take care of what we already have. We need to settle into this place that has supported us through our entire existence and remember that we belong here. This world is our home and its ok to rest and enjoy our being here. What use is striving if you never reach your destination? Our cultural progress doesn‚Äôt have to be a mad dash towards ever new horizons, part of growing is the rest you take after your journey. This is where you can integrate all that you‚Äôve done and learned and reflect upon what‚Äôs valuable in life.

These ideas are mirrored in the archetypes of Hermes and Hestia. These gods were traditionally constellated together as their energies balance each other out. Hermes resides over technology, commerce, and movement. He is the spirit of the traveler and the inventor, of language and its use to create material things. He is very much the god of our times, with so much information moving around, and so much attachment to our goals and strivings. What we have lost in modern times is a connection with Hestia. She is the goddess of the hearth, of warmth and belonging. In Hestia, we find our own centers, we find that we can rest where we are and tend to what needs nurturing. Hestia is the grounding presence that‚Äôs needed if Hermes‚Äô wanderings become manic and uncontrolled. And so her embrace is greatly needed in these unstable times.

**Materialism (Deconstruction/Discernment) and Spirit (Interconnection/Relationship)**

Another myth that I feel is coming to an end is the idea of a purely materialistic universe. The idea that this world can be broken down into its fundamental pieces and that from there we can understand what all this is. Materialism is certainly true on one plane of reality and has aided our understanding of the physical world greatly. The technologic and scientific knowledge we have amassed through viewing the world through an objective lens is truly astonishing and has created the context for the world we currently live in. But viewing life as if it were mere material is both shortsighted and problematic, the consequences of this belief allow for the destruction of the natural world and exploitation of its inhabitants. When we view the bounty of nature as resources for our own use, we strip the world of its needs and its voice. The world loses its subjective presence and becomes a dead backdrop for our own human activities rather than a living environment we are a part of. This world is not a collection of objects, it is a community of subjects.

I feel like most sciences are coming to this understanding, we‚Äôre finding that we can‚Äôt ever truly know anything in complete isolation for identity itself is relational, we are what we are only in relation to what we‚Äôre not. In the natural sciences, we can look at biomes and see how each creature fulfills a necessary role that allows for the whole environments flourishing. Each organism exists not just as an isolated entity, but as an interconnected force in constant relation to its environment. We are participants within the world, we are the world‚Äôs unfolding, we are verbs as well as nouns, waves as well as particles. Even physics has come to this understanding with ideas of quantum entanglement. You can‚Äôt remove the subject from its context because its context is what makes it it.

This brings me to the phenomenological perspective, to the illusory duality of subject and object that allows the phenomena of experience to happen. It is the experience of separation that allows for the creation of experience, there must be a you and a me for relationship to occur. Our language operates in this form as well, the subject finds itself only in relation to an external object and the object can only exist in the gaze of a subject. But in reality, it‚Äôs just experience, it‚Äôs simply a happening. Buddhists call this idea ‚ÄúDialectical Monism‚Äù. Reality is ultimately a unified whole, but for experience to take place, a separation has to occur, there must be polarities for any quality or perception to take form. Light requires darkness, the inner requires the outer, the subject requires the object, these traits are in a state of interdependence for the other to make sense. Mathematically, this idea is 1-1=0. The absolute state of things is unified, but a dualistic trick of the mind allows for creation and relationship to occur. Now what this illusion of separation allows for is the possibility for union, for a coming together. God must split himself in two in order for the cosmic dance to unfold. And I guess I‚Äôm hoping that as a culture, we can start to come together once more. Even in our language, to heal means ‚Äúto make whole‚Äù. I hope we can move out of this manic delusion that we are all isolated beings fending for ourselves and find communion with those around us, to find ourselves in our togetherness.

**In Conclusion**

In this time of transformation, we must bear witness to the death of our old ways of being. Like the caterpillar, we must allow our previous form to dissolve so that the imago will come into being. We are moving into a period of great change, the old ways will not go easily, but as individuals and as community, we are empowered to move with this current and live out these new myths. This is not to disavow our past or dismiss all that we‚Äôve learned from this experience. My thinking is that our path is like that of the prodigal son. We left home so that we could return and see it with new eyes, we were cast out of the garden so that in our return we could hold true understanding of our place within its sanctuary. Our story is of our great wandering and of our forgetting so that one day, we may come back home and remember who we are.",1605381105.0
spirituality,Twice I've had a fountain of sludge shoot out of my pineal gland. Once during a DMT session and once doing some inner child work. Help me understand!!!,"I have to start by saying that I‚Äôve had this same experience twice in my lifetime now. Both situations came under very similar circumstances, aside from the fact that the first one was facilitated by DMT. The first time I was 18 years old. I had just graduated high school, my girlfriend left me and I quit my job in the same week. We were in the woods smoking DMT and my one friend started screaming ‚ÄúU. D. F.‚Äù After a couple times my other friend shouts, ‚ÄúThe Unknown Destiny of Fate!‚Äù As I contemplated that statement this feeling of calmness and understanding and connectedness that I had never experienced before came over me. Then, all of a sudden, from the very center of my brain I felt this hot sensation and then some sort of sludge or liquid shooting up out of my brain like a fountain.

Fast forward 15 years to right around my 33rd birthday. I took on a very stressful promotion and I find out my second girlfriend in a row is cheating on me the same exact way. This time I‚Äôm four years in. I was deathly afraid of the change and being on my own. I didn‚Äôt want her to leave and I told her that I was going to spend every day becoming the best version of myself, the one that she would want to come back to, and no matter if she came back or not, whatever came out the other side would be a far better version of myself.¬† (Thank god she never came back!) Through the help of my sister, this began my spiritual journey.¬†

My father had an affair that lasted well over a year when I was 8-9. My sister and I were taken on a car ride by my mother one time to show us all the signs my dad had left for my step mom along her mail route to tell her happy birthday. My mom taught me the 10 commandments to manipulate me into telling my dad that adultery would send him to hell. I answered the door once to two men standing there with guns asking for my dad. As you can tell, the catalyst for me needing a spiritual journey.¬†

33 year old me was writing a very intense letter to my dad. I came to the realization that my life always felt like I was inside a video game and I died, but instead of restarting the level like you would in a video game, that was it. I just got up from my spot and continued playing through a game that would never matter, because it wasn‚Äôt real. From that point on I wasn‚Äôt living a real life because in my head at 9 years old, there wasn‚Äôt a life outside of my family and my parents being together. I‚Äôm texting with my sister to talk to her about this revelation and, without thought, I typed out a phrase I had never even once considered. I said, ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre better off this way.‚Äù What? Better off? As I went back through my memories I tried to picture what could have been IF I never lost my life in that video game and I was still playing it. There was that sensation all over again. The core of my brain was on fire and, just like the first time, only this time more intense, a hot, viscous, dark black sludge started shooting out of the center of my brain like the fountains at the Bellagio. I felt it reach the top of my skull and then spread out to each and every corner of my head then rain down my entire body to my sternum. I shot up heroin and meth, at the same time, every day for a while. I have never been that high in my lifetime. As with the first time, it came with a sense of peace and calmness that was completely foreign to my being.¬†

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever heard of such a thing happening. I don‚Äôt know if you are able to give me any more insight than this being a spiritual third eye opening. I‚Äôm not looking for answers to validate what happened to me. I know how real and powerful it was. However, I am incredibly curious to have an explanation and to try to understand better and see if there is more that I can learn from this experience.¬†",1605369397.0

spirituality,"A New Moon in Scorpio - November 14th, 2020","The New Moon in Scorpio this month takes place at 9:07 PM, PST, on Saturday, November 14th. This is actually quite a constructive and purposeful lunation, and so it's worth feeling into and translating its energy into your own life. Ruling it is Mars in Aries, which has completed two-thirds of its ""renovation"" process it has been in since the start of July this year. **This is a potent and positive omen, as Mars actually goes direct just the day before, on Friday the 13th.**

With Mars direct now and ruling this New Moon, we can look forward to the resolution and reversal of issues that have been long plaguing us with their incompleteness. **Mars Retrograde since mid-September has brought delays, rethinks and immersive confrontations with our own willpower, and the limits thereof.** Over the past two months, we've been especially challenged in whatever area Aries rules in our charts, by whole-sign house. For example, if you've got Cancer rising, Mars Rx has been in your 10th whole sign house, during which time you've probably encountered necessary but aggravating obstacles to your career and vocational life. You can expect these blockages to begin shifting now - slowly at first, and then gradually gaining momentum.

Generally speaking, these delays and setbacks will have been for the better, even if during the retrograde, we felt blocked or like we were **giving 200% effort for 50% of expected results.** While this energetic upgrade will still take until mid-February of 2021 to fully complete, the grinding, raw frustration should start to ease up now. We can expect things to begin happening at a quicker pace, to get answers, and to see some germination of the seeds we've been trying to coax to life.

The actual New Moon itself is configured in a flowing way to the current stellium in Capricorn - Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto - which have been creating so much systemic upheaval, fear, catharsis and dark rapture over 2020. It has been one of ""those years"" - one which history will remember for a long time to come. However, at this New Moon we have a window of opportunity to begin making sense of these shifts in a new way. **Emotional integration, deeper alignment, and making firm decisions based on trust are all in the mix.**

The idea of ""being sure"" of something - not from the head so much as the gut - is a key Scorpio frame. Coupled with that is the idea of ""investment"" or of something being worthy of our full commitment. Scorpio shoots from the hip and is all or nothing, and at this New Moon we can begin to see where ""going all in"" could pay off down the line. Of course, this requires a process of checking in with our own integrity at crossroads moments - indeed, the image and **feeling of a crossroads is strong** at this New Moon.

While there are still numerous challenges to be faced in the coming weeks and months, this New Moon signals a relative turning point. It does not denote miracles or sudden graces, as the moon is in Fall in Scorpio. The movements of this lunation are likely to be more privately felt, intimate, personal and introspective, the results of which will play out over the next 6 months until **the Full Moon in Scorpio on April 26th, 2021.** That Full Moon acts as a bookend for this process we are about to begin, and promises earthy, tangible results through our deep work and shadow processes.

This is a fantastic time to embark on an analysis of your patterns of holding back, control, obsession, deep desires, and especially, unconscious fears. How do you really feel right now about x or y? What is driving you forward, or pushing you from the rear? Often in life it is so hard to tell the real answers to these questions. **You may think you know how you feel, but actually feeling it is another matter.** Getting clear about your true motivations at this New Moon will help create the momentum you need to move through these next 6 months, but it's a process that requires a different level of intimacy and attention.

This New Moon moment could include revelations of its own that serve as a starting gun for this process of searching. Mercury is finalizing its oppositions with Uranus, as well as its own Retrograde period which was fairly chaotic. Watch for big reveals and flashes of insight this weekend. Also important is Venus, which makes superior squares to the Capricorn trio, highlighting again our search for justice and due process in both our personal and public lives. **Now would be a time to make a plan for the next months - a strategy that is both rooted in your own ""truth,"" as well as being ruthlessly pragmatic.** Now would not be a time to play games with yourself - call your own bluff if you've been stalling out on something critical.

It's time to put your chips in and ante up. This last few weeks of 2020 offers a dazzling finale of big eclipses, a triplicity shift we haven't seen for 800 years, and the completing of Mars' big renovations. It's definitely no slouch for end-of-year astrology this time. You can expect things to move in a way that they haven't over the past few months - this can be for good or not. It's time to sharpen those edges and drop in as the energy around us begins to untangle and move forward.

**Questions for Journalling and Shadow Work:**

1. What feels like it‚Äôs been stalled out in my life? What have been the reasons for that, externally and internally?
2. In what ways could I begin to engage that blockage differently now, in line with the changing energetic tides around me? Where could I listen for more help, for more clues?
3. In what places do I need to trust more, invest more, get off the fence, and create sacred devotion? What does ‚Äúreal alignment‚Äù mean to me? Where does that level of truth come from?

spirituality,How to handle being completely at ease,"Hi dear fellow people of this funny experience. 

Recently I have found myself in a state of perfect calmness and content after yoga and meditation. I can just sit for the rest of the day and look out the window, maybe go for a walk but do pretty much nothing and I don't feel like I need any distraction. No chewing gum, no music, no socialising. I find anything else that I could do to be a disturbance of that calmness. 

I'm not sure what to do with that state. From a practical point of view I get absolutely nothing done, which is fine sometimes but how much of this state of mind do I want then?

It's rather nice but what do I do with it is a question I'm asking myself. I was always wondering what monks who spend most of their time meditating get out of it.

spirituality,Seeking advice on how to feel at peace spending time alone,"Hi guys was wondering if there‚Äôs anything that I can do to start to really enjoy spending long periods of time doing things on my own.

At the beginning of this year I was very close to a group of friends. I felt really bonded and close to them, they type of friends to do everything together. To make a long story short, eventually, I started to have a lot of realizations and discovered spirituality, yoga, regular meditation, deleted all my social media and started focusing on school and after that never heard from any of my friends again even after trying to reach out a few times. One day we were fine, and the next day it felt like our friendship and I meant nothing to them. I faced it head on and decided well damn it‚Äôs time to do this all on my own now. It has been about 10 months of this and everyday still feels strange and isolated, I thought I would get used to it a little by now, and while I am happy knowing that it must have been in my own best interest for this all to happen, I struggle with feeling very alone and isolated sometimes. It‚Äôs lonely not having people that you can call up and talk to or not having anyone to make plans with. I don‚Äôt miss my friendship with these people in specific but I miss having that close bond with someone. I want to feel content going out and doing things alone. Is there anything that I can practice or advice on how to face this lonely journey or at least make it a little more comfortable.",1605118579.0
spirituality,Loving Self (30),"It takes Time. Its Practice.

  
I realized to myself that I didn't want to allow the struggle to consume my Being, Mind &amp; Body Anymore. I Had Enough. Consuming Alcohol to numb the pain, numb myself, numb my identity. Smoking copious amounts over the past 7 years as well, made it very easy to push everything that was of value to me, further and further down, allowing me to run the other direction faster and faster. 

  
It came to a point where I didn't feel right anymore. I wasn't happy, I didn't feel, I wasn't aware of my energy, I was blocking my own path with my constant self numbing that I was telling myself was ""Just For Fun"", but really had turned into a necessity and an addiction through my own little past times. 

  
Celebration. Everyday we are so lucky to wake up. To open our eyes, to start a new day of opportunity and Life. Its amazing how I put opportunity first before Life, when Without Life there is no opportunity. We learn, we move forward. I have learned that when I have begun to accept how I feel, how I think, how I act fully and watching them instead of judging or dwelling, that the healing process comes naturally right after. It takes time and believe you me, I am just beginning my healing process. 

  
Giving myself the love needed for myself day to day has allowed me to now want to be the best me possible. Through day to day Journaling, Meditation, Being Present in Nature, Going for Walks, Sharing time with Family and Friends as well as Focusing on my Creative, Healing and Happiness is Possible and It is for You too. 

  
I love you.

spirituality,Christian but ... not? Help.,"I‚Äôm feeling really alone. I‚Äôve always been confident in my spiritual practice but I have been tormented lately and having full blown panic attacks at least twice a week about this. 

I was raised Christian and I never stopped believing in God or Jesus - although I did stop going to church as a teenager. I guess I ‚Äúmoved away‚Äù from Christianity in my teens and my practice became more open - but still deeply devoted and spiritual. As a 24 y.o I have fallen deeply in love with blending mental health awareness into deep spiritual transformation. I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of childhood and teen trauma from abusive parents and parental suicide. It‚Äôs been a lot. The only reason I‚Äôm adding this info is because I feel like I‚Äôve never fully been on board with traditional Christianity because i never felt like it gave me enough space to grieve and feel pain for my inner child and her losses. I do a lot of ‚Äúshadow work‚Äù. I have oracle cards and I practice meditation. 

I‚Äôm a massage therapist and I own my own studio where I offer reiki. This is my passion. When I was young I told my mom I wanted to ‚Äúheal‚Äù people. As I‚Äôve grown, I‚Äôve learned that we never heal people ‚Äî we simple hold space for them to heal themselves. We act as the conduit for their healing. 

I always felt confident using the words, ‚Äúuniverse, spirit, god, creator, source‚Äù. They all meant ‚ÄúHim‚Äù. I never doubted my love for God/the universe. 

HOWEVER, last year I fell deeply in love with a devout Christian man. He never judged these aspects of me in a way that was asking me to change myself ‚Äî but he did tell me that our values didn‚Äôt align and that we ultimately wouldn‚Äôt work our long term. 

I‚Äôm not asking for advice on this relationship although if you feel you have something encouraging and constructive to say, by all means. 

The panic attacks started because I love this man so deeply that I began to question my entire life and the growth I‚Äôve moved through to heal my childhood. My devotion to God ‚Äî the way I feel safe and on fire loving Him ‚Äî it all started to feel ‚Äúwrong‚Äù because of the tools I‚Äôve used to get here. Tarot, oracle cards, mediums, meditation, affirmations. 

All of the ‚Äúnew age‚Äù spirituality that I‚Äôve grown with and felt lifted by suddenly felt chaotic because of what the Bible says and I feel SO lost. 

I don‚Äôt want to denounce any of this. I used to stand tall and say, ‚Äúwhat I practice is safe for me and I know this because it‚Äôs always brought me closer to God. It‚Äôs always helped me feel whole, safe and loved.‚Äù And now I feel empty and alone and broken. 

I keep searching for communities that blend Christianity and ‚Äúnew age‚Äù spirituality to make sense of it. I can‚Äôt find any answers and while I‚Äôm looking is usually what triggers my panic attacks. 

If ANYONE has any advice or recommendations, please let me know. 

My entire life feels like it‚Äôs on the edge of changing and I feel like I‚Äôm losing myself and I don‚Äôt want to. I want to continue being the person I am ‚Äî with a beautiful and loving reiki practice. I want to have faith in God and my personal growth experience. 

I am so so lost.

spirituality,Pray for me as I quit smoking,"Over the past year I have made leaps and bounds in the understanding of myself and creation. Call it a grand reconnection with the present moment, eternity, my true self or a relationship with God, this part matters not.

I found sobriety in 2019 and this year I quit smoking in January. However I encountered some hardships, and although I was perfectly capable of handling this and did so successfully I decided to pick up my smoking habit again in April. At first I just wanted to enjoy the weather with the simple pleasure but it escalated into a habit after a few weeks.

The problem is I always pray when I smoke, and thus I am overcome with peace and love during these meditation sessions. It is a problem because I have intertwined the love of the Creator and the act of smoking and these two forces have become linked.

I am beginning a relationship with a new partner and she does not smoke so I do not want to bring that into the relationship. Beyond that, I no longer enjoy the act of smoking because it has become simply a matter of feeding the addiction and is no longer pleasurable, aside from having those moments to be alone and pray outside.

Please offer your advice and your well wishes as I attempt to quit smoking, I would love the support of this community as I continue on with grace. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",1591419094.0

spirituality,Just be yourself.,"I am starting to realize that the fundamental part of this search is to follow my own voice, my own guru, my own inner guide. To follow my own intuition.

If I can do that, if I can do that courageously and boldly, in spite of the hesitation and possible or imagined consequences... everything else is given. In fact, there is nowhere else to go. A life lived authentically is something that cannot be topped. It is the greatest joy, the greatest fulfillment, and the greatest peace.

It does not matter if what you do is ""wrong"". The only thing that is wrong is to be false. Anything that is dysfunctional, wounded, hurt, or suffering will be healed if you can only be yourself, unapologetically. It may take time, but it will take much less time if it is allowed into the light.

Only that which is expressed, real, and lived authentically can be healed. That which is false cannot be healed. That which is hidden cannot be healed.

Perhaps the greatest wound is that, ""What I am, is not enough"". Accept yourself totally, and that is all the healing that is needed.

spirituality,The Secret of Meditationüßéüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è," The secret of meditation is - when we sit still and the mind wanders, we should not lose our peace, we should gently bring the mind back. But again, it will wander. The mind is like a monkey, it will keep jumping from thought to thought, and it will wander, not to just one thought, but to many thoughts. The moment we regain consciousness during our meditation, we must gently bring our mind back. As we persist in bringing the mind back after its wandering, we will make it a habit for the mind not to wander. That's why we need focus, we need concentration. We need to be conscious of one thought and try to bring the mind back to that thought. That would help us to achieve our goal.",1598690361.0

Kind of makes me remember to not hold on to anything in this world, and just continuously let go. You cannot be in control most times. And trying to stay in control, is what breeds animosity and self hatred. Because it is imply impossible to be in control of certain things. But, when we fail to do so, we think it is our fault.

spirituality,You can be aware even if you are in an environment of completely unaware people. You do not have to pretend being asleep just because of pressure or anything. You are not bothered by that.,"&gt;. It is more difficult to be a aware and in the present if you are surrounded by other people you care about who have a completely different mentality about this‚Äîdriven by desire, anxiety, and other very base human drives.

Why is it difficult? It is only difficult because you give the power of belief to your mind. It is not difficult until comes a thought saying ""this is difficult"" and you just believe in that thought, making it appear as if you are truly experiencing it as difficult. That thought is perceived, it is not you. You are not even seeing the truth at this point, you are already identifying with the mind, being unaware. You must simply be aware and determined to stay aware, and nothing will be difficult. See it as your only job. Perceive that which is perceiving.

&gt;I see them as imperfect individuals who are doing their best and love me.

Why see them for something they are not? They might be ego-driven currently but their essence is pure love, pure consciousness, pure joy, pure compassion. The mask that they are putting should not affect how you see them. It makes no sense. You are basically putting on a mask your self and then judging them by their masks, as the ego does to its own projections.

&gt;Other days, however, I am more judgmental of them and it comes through in a negative way.

You must be aware that you are not judgmental, and you can never be judgemental. To be judgemental means that you are doing something, means you are doing the judging. That is not true, because the true being does not judge, it only effortlessly and naturally perceives. You are that which is perceiving judging, you can't be the judging itself, nor the thinker of the judging. It is something that the self simply won't do. The only thing that can be judgemental is a thought, once this thought is believed in by what you are (pure awareness) then it appears true. Thoughts which are anxious, judgmental appeared, and you decided to believe these thoughts to be yourself. You are not letting anything else other than these thoughts to flourish. You must discern between your self and the chattering mind within you. The chattering mind is very personal. Everything about it is personal. You must remain as the impersonal self.

Realizing yourself to be that which is perceives perceiving itself, will make life completely effortless. That which tries to do things with ""effort"" is itself perceived, it is not you. Anything that is anything less than peace, bliss, love, joy, compassion is perceived, when you perceive the perceiver itself, you notice that peace, bliss, love, joy and compassion are all naturally radiating from that perceiver. Stay perceiving of that which is perceiving. It is not hard, it is very natural, it is a joy. You'll notice how you will be literally present 100% of the day, whatever thoughts, emotions or sensations appear, they are perceived also, you'll be a light onto the world, because what you are is truly light. We must simply stay in the place of our true position and seeing, not in the place of identification with thoughts. Even identification with thoughts is perceived. Perceive that which is perceiving, this will help you so so much. Whenever you expect an unconscious situation to appear, be in that place of perceiving the perceiving and do not let go of it.

&gt;I am grateful for this opportunity to practice patience and forgiveness with my family but also think I will personally develop and thrive more when I am away from them on an everyday basis, and be able to love them better.

The mind makes you believe life is a practice. You are not here to practice anything, you are here to be purely the life that you are. You must simply exist as you are, and be aware (naturally, effortlessly you are and aware). If you are simply aware, everything will look and behave like heaven, simply because there is no identification with thoughts, emotions, sensations. Life is literally what you are. That divine love IS the life energy that you are. At all times. It can't be anywhere else. It is the being itself, and it is what you are.

The egoic-mind thinks ""I will personally develop and thrive more when I am away"". That might be true, and it also might be that you won't develop nor thrive. The self-realized does not develop nor thrive for anything. It is simply aware. The ego wants to develop and thrive, to show itself, to prove itself, but all of that is unnecessary suffering in your experiencing. You do not have to follow all of its plans and desires, you can simply stay as you are, at the place of perceiving the perceiver, you don't have to do something and work all the time like everyone and everything wants you to. It is completely ok to just exist, enjoy the beauty and immensity that this vast universe is, just by doing this you are actually an infinite blessing to the world. It is encouraged for you to be the self. Every single thing in life will automatically be blessed by your presence.",1589469366.0

# [Part 1](https://youtu.be/bUdn9OiYzt0)- What is Meditation?

It's important to understand what meditation is before we practice it to make sure we are doing it properly and with the right intentions.

Meditation is about strengthening our awareness and mindfulness by returning to our observing nature simply observing what is happening in the present moment.

It is not about stopping the mind and having no thoughts, but about observing the mind and accepting the thoughts, letting them come and go and being at peace with it.

Meditation can increase our patience, joy, peace, and control of the mind which benefits every aspect of life.

# [Part 2](https://youtu.be/m-8lLq5FhnM) - The Benefits of Meditation

Meditation is long known to its profound benefits on the mind and body and has been practiced since ancient times.

The three main benefits that we will begin to experience from our first session are:

1. A heightened sense of awareness and greater clarity of mind
2. Greater emotional control
3. Sense of inner peace and joy. Meditation helps us in every aspect of life be it at work, at home, or with friends.

It makes us more effective in everything we do because we can think with more clarity and insight. With meditation, we start creating like instead of reacting to it, or worse it just surviving it.

# [Part 3](https://youtu.be/C8pC-7x9KDk) - Preparation for Meditation

When it comes to preparation, there are three main areas.

They are:

\- Physical preparation (maintaining a strong, healthy and energetic body)

\- Mental preparation (maintaining a calm, focused and gentle mind)

\- Environmental preparation (having a clean, quiet, comfortable and safe spot to meditate)

Preparation for meditation is just as important as the actual practice itself and requires our attention throughout the entire day, not just the minutes leading up. In fact, preparation in a sense is its own full-time practice that we must all develop and cultivate.

# [Part 4](https://youtu.be/fPVOP1Un-e0) - How to Meditate

After we understand the idea of meditation, its benefits, and how to prepare our mind and body, we can begin our meditation.

In meditation, the process is clear and simple.

1. Find a comfortable position, back straight, shoulders slightly rolled back.
2. Find complete stillness of the body, no scratching, itching, rubbing, twitching, leaning.
3. Bring stillness to the eyes, slow down the flickering, darting and moving of the eyes.
4. Observe the breath and allow it to slow down, deepen and lengthen.
5. When the mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath.
6. Enjoy!

When we incorporate meditation into our daily routine, it brings much clarity to our mind, much sharpness to our senses, much effectiveness to our everyday tasks and much peace and joy to our natural state.

# [Part 5](https://youtu.be/AogtMJNleNU) - Managing the Difficulties of Meditation

Sometimes we have the motivation and good intention to practice meditation. But when we finally allocate some time to sit, we are dealt with some inconvenient challenges and obstacles that make it difficult to meditate.

I'd like to discuss four of the most comment difficulties in meditation and how we can manage them when they arise.

They are:

1. Pain and soreness
2. Drowsiness and tiredness
3. Lack of focus and a wandering mind
4. No free time to meditate!

When we learn to deal with these four main difficulties, meditation becomes much more pleasant and enjoyable which helps us make faster and more meaningful progress.

# [Part 6](https://youtu.be/uyBKGr9FQcY) - Concentration Meditation

After the mind is focused through Concentration Meditation, every other meditation practice becomes must easier and more beneficial.

Main tips to practice concentration meditation:

1. Sit comfortably.
2. Find complete stillness in the body and eyes.
3. Observe the only thing that's still moving which is the breath.
4. When the mind wanders, gently bring it back.
5. Repeat for the entire duration of the session.

A focused mind also benefits every aspect of life including work, family, social, health, and romance because it allows us to be more present and to live more deliberately and intentionally.

# [Part 7](https://youtu.be/lxXS6PCPTCw) - Mindfulness Meditation

Mindfulness is about being fully present and aware of where we are, what we're doing, how we feel, and what we think on a moment by moment basis.

By doing so, we wake up to the inner workings of our mental, emotional, and physical processes and understand why we are the way we are, think the way we think, and feel the way we feel. This understanding, coupled with acceptance leads to deep peace in the here and now.

The four main ways I share about developing mindfulness are:

1. Pay more attention - Try to take the time to experience your environment with all of your senses; touch, sound, sight, smell, and taste.
2. Live in the moment - Try to intentionally bring an open, accepting and discerning attention to everything you do. Find joy in simple pleasures.
3. Accept yourself fully - Treat yourself the way you would treat a good friend, with patience, empathy, and kindness.
4. Mindfulness meditation - Allow the mind to flow naturally and simply observe where it goes. Ground ourselves in our observing nature and watch life play out like a movie.

Mindfulness has changed my life as it has to everyone who has cultivated it in the past and present. It is about developing something we all have innate without ourselves, being our observing nature that's free from discriminations, criticism, and judgments.

# [Part 8](https://youtu.be/WRNh3vpXIzo) - Gratitude Meditation

Gratitude is focusing on all the good things in life and being thankful for everything that brings us happiness. It is about developing a thankful appreciation for all of life's joy and abundance, instead of focusing on life's negative sides. 

There are four main ways to develop gratitude: 

1. Mental Gratitude Exercises - Recount 3-5 good things that happened during the day, every night before bed. And remind yourself of all the good things that will be happening today, every morning. 
2. Gratitude Journal - Every time something good happens, write it in. Big all Small. 
3. Express gratitude openly and frequently - Express your gratitude for your friends, family and work to them directly. It will make them feel so respected and appreciated. 
4. Gratitude Meditation - (Passive) Be mindful of all your thoughts, feelings, sensations and emotions, and observe them through the lens of gratitude. (Active) Actively think positive thoughts, grateful thoughts, and be thankful for all of we have. 

Benefits of Gratitude: Strengthens friendships, Encourages humility, Reduces envy and jealousy, Increases fulfillment, Reduces selfishness, Improves physical and emotional wellbeing, Increases empathy, Strengthens self-esteem. 

May we all develop a grateful mind and observe all the joy and beauty life has to offer. how to practice gratitude meditation

I had the thinnest fucking piece of paper. I stepped outside, sent my energy into the paper, and went to burn it. The fucking thing would NOT BURN! AT ALL! 

It took me several minutes until a deep voice hit me almost softly saying ""Tiffany, you need to let go."" No doubts. It was loud and pronounced.

spirituality,"Not enough clothes, not enough shoes, not enough hats, houses, cars. Not enough stuff.","Why does the ego always want when it already has everything it needs?

The  ego always wants because it doesn't have what it needs. It has what it craves, it has what it thinks it should want, it has what keeps the body  alive, but it doesn't have what it needs.

What it needs is itself.

The ego doesn‚Äôt know what one is, the ego is not in touch with one‚Äôs true nature, the ego is a story about a person that, from the ego‚Äôs point of  view, is missing. The ego can‚Äôt connect to this being, this person, can‚Äôt experience  it directly.

What  the ego does is trying to dress up this invisible being, hoping that if  it piles enough clothes, hats, shoes on top of the empty space where it  thinks this being is, then the being will emerge. The ego thinks that  if it gets enough stuff for the being, enough money, enough titles and  achievements, enough positions and standing among other egos, enough  respect, then the being will materialize and the ego will finally know  who it is, what it is. It will finally feel fulfilled. It will finally  feel real.

But  this never happens, it can never happen because what one is, the true  nature of what one is, is invisible to ego. The being is beyond the  ego‚Äôs capacity to perceive.

Previously I discussed four of the lower chakras, if you haven't seen them, check them out starting with root. Links are at the bottom.

#Throat Gateway:

The throat chakra is your gateway to communication and truth expression. Being heard, truthfulness, feeling accepted socially are all very important traits governed by throat chakra.

#Lower Chakra Influence:

In essence, throat brings together many of the lower chakras in overall expression. 

Having good security and stability (Root) is the foundation of expression, being overwhelmed by fight or flight will block throat as well. 

Freedom of expression is vitally important to expressing truth (Sacral).

Health, strength and bodily will, mentally and spiritually benefits throat (Solar Plexus).

Self-love, self-confidence, and self-esteem all play a major roll in how your truth is expressed (Heart).

#Blockages and Imbalance

The key blockages for throat can be easily felt by imagining yourself on a stage in front of a large crowd of skeptics and presenting spirituality. Anxiety, self-doubt, and feeling overwhelmed are some of the signs that you still have room to improve your throat chakra.

&gt;""The main challenge for the fifth chakra is doubt and negative thinking. When you gain and verify your knowledge through meditation and direct experience, then doubt and negativity are removed.""

#Understanding the Throat

Confidence in your truth comes from belief and experience of your truth, but also understanding the shortcomings, misinterpretations, criticisms, and counterarguments to your truth. You must have solid backing both in terms of credibility and references. Throat is your expression of truth, so to convince or communicate effectively to others you must be prepared mentally, emotionally, and physically.

&gt;""As a communication center, it not only allows you to express who you are and what you stand for, but also allows you to listen deeply to another.""

One very important aspect of throat which I see often overlooked in communities is in receiving feedback and input. This is not a one way valve. If you treat what you say as dogma, you are doing yourself the highest disservice. Open communication means you are trying to convey your thoughts, but equally important you are willing to accept new thoughts from those who you communicate with.

Engage and be engaged. No one knows everything, be open to new truths.

&gt;""A person with an open Visuddha chakra is a good listener, she enables another person to have the experience of being heard - one of the most profound human needs.""

&gt;""Authentic expression is not something that comes easily. There‚Äôs a delicate dance between saying what you mean and staying tactful or diplomatic. Often it‚Äôs easier to say what the other person may want to hear instead of speaking your truth. Fear of not being accepted, or judgment from the other may hinder your truthful verbal expression.""

#Practical Tips

Checks for valid and powerful communication.

- is it true
- is it relevant 
- is it helpful
- is it necessary 
- is it considerate

Your higher self is kind, compassionate, and universally loving and tolerant. Words spoken from the higher self are the most powerful and impactful you could ever utter. 

Public speaking is a very powerful method of training to achieve a balanced throat. You will be overcoming fear, anxiety, stress, and if you don't want to have a bored or hostile audience, you better know what you're talking about and be interesting.

I practiced public speaking weekly for four years and in this time I learned the following:

- voice projection 
- clear diction 
- consistent message 
- confidence of message 
- reading the audience and adjusting as necessary
- tuning out distractions
- keeping them engaged

I often throw comedic quips into even my driest, most serious reports. Even in an audience of very serious and technically minded individuals, a quip will go a long way to keep them engaged and listening. You know your communication is failing if your audience is falling asleep, playing on their phones, or chatting to each other.

#Shadow Work

Though most of your shadow work is done in Solar Plexus and Heart, throat has it's own challenges.

Moods and triggers, letting your emotions drive you, and losing logic over passion are all ways that can turn your well planned and insightful communication into sloppy emoting.

Triggers are the biggest obstacle here. When you experience one, try to understand where it's coming from and address it. Especially in debate, it is vitally important that your opponent doesn't trigger you.

spirituality,The world is being shown the fragility of things which are gained,"Good health to all. 

In life, there are those things which are innate and those which must be gained. We as a race have been so caught up in our empires that we have neglected or even forgotten the grounds they were built on. 

Now, the castle is being shaken. Yes, it will hopefully hold until dawn. But the tremors we are now feeling result from the fragility of those things which must be gained. We reaped them from the earth, melded them to our liking, but at some point they must be reduced back to the earth. Anything which is gained must again be lost.

With this fragility in mind, let us turn our attention to those things which we needn‚Äôt accumulate in order to have in excess. Love, compassion, connection, breath. These simple things keep us grounded, make us who we are. Our fancy possessions and dreams of success are merely additions to the overwhelming wealth we already have.

Many things are threatening the bubble of comfort which many of us have been allowed, but I hope we do not lose faith. This comfort exists only on the surface, it is as fragile as the things which produce it. It is the internal connection we have with existence and each other which truly brings life into our bodies, and this will persist with or without comfort. This moment in history should be a reminder of where we came from, and what truly lasts.",1584410805.0

spirituality,Mother Nature has not brought us Winter this year,"I live in the mountains of Western North Carolina, and usually the winter season always brings us cold weather and tons of snow. But, for the first time, in the 18 years that i‚Äôve lived here, Mother Nature has not brought us a single snow yet. This is quite unusual and doesn‚Äôt align with the mountain weather that I know and love. I am now increasingly aware that the natural cycle, that humanity is currently acclimated to, is shifting and I fear that we are not prepared for this devastating change in our planets atmosphere. I am disgusted that America hasn‚Äôt taken any action in at least trying to reverse the effects of green house gas emissions. I‚Äôm shocked that the American government evidently supports the interests of big businesses corporations and the billionaires that own them. The revolution starts now.",1581785122.0
spirituality,Corona virus and keeping your vibrations high,"The only real scary thing about Corona virus is the amount of fear the media injects into the public. What we are really fighting here is the collective consciousness of negative thoughts vs positive thoughts. The light is always stronger. Let's keep our thoughts positive. It's only natural to have negative or fearful thoughts in these times, but we don't have to dwell there. We will contain this virus just like every other pandemic scare that came before this. Pray/send positive energy to China and everyone suffering from the virus. Trust in God and know that you are healthy mentally and physically. A healthy mind is a healthy body.

spirituality,You are beautiful you just don't know it.,"""A lady walks every day, 5 miles in each direction, to a river. At the river she fills her 2 buckets and walks home. A long stick across her shoulders with a bucket on each side. The bucket on her right side carries every single drop of water home with no problem. He is proud of his work and brags to the other bucket feverently. The bucket on the left however had a crack down its side and every single day, by the time the lady is home only half of his water is left. This made him sad, she is such a lovely lady and works so hard and because of his incompetence compared to other buckets she gets less water.

One day after 2 long years the depression and guilt became too much. He said to the lady ""Girl, why do you still fill me? Each day for 2 years I have brought you nothing but disappointment. The other bucket has brought you home a full bucket every time for your hard work and I only bring back half a bucket. Why do you still choose me even when I let you down every single day?!?""

The lady smiled and looked further into the distance and said ""I have always known about your crack and that is the reason I bring you with me. Do you see the flowers along the road? They go the whole way home.. 2 years ago I planted flower seeds and every day your beautiful crack waters my flowers on the way home.

spirituality,The Collective reality,"Call me crazy if you like......there is only so much rubbish that the world can put up with before it begins to self-cleanse. It could be me or you next, I don't know. What I do know is that the world (ALL OF US) needs healing, and the greatest healer is LOVE, not selfish love (emptying the supermarkets or profiteering from the tragic situation), but taking the time to reflect upon what will become of you without the love and care from those around you, appreciating each other, taking the time to reflect on the meaning of life. Life is beautiful, we are all beautiful. Yes, competition is good but not if you hurt others along the way. The situation with the coronavirus is nothing more than our collective reality of all the hate and selfishness that is fast and surely killing the present and future generations. We have the power to change our collective reality. Let Us Love One Another",1584965522.0
spirituality,My spiritual journey was the loneliest until,"I accepted the fact that not everyone is on the same page as me. When I started my spiritual journey, I was the loneliest. You see, I wanted to be understood. I have been busy educating myself about my newfound knowledge and I want to share it with people, especially with my loved ones. Although they listened sometimes I felt like I wasn't heard. My bf is also a skeptic. He does not believe what I believe in and I did not feel supported. 

But now I realized that loneliness is necessary. It's part of the journey. My spiritual journey is something that's very personal with me so I cannot expect everyone to just believe and accept it the way I did. If this is my version of ""awakening"", maybe others have it differently. It does not always have to resonate with mine and just because they don't practice it the way I would does not me they are less awake or conscious. 

My bf still does not understand my beliefs sometimes yet loves me the way i want to be loved. He's good for my sanity and he lets me be. He allows me to explore my spirituality the way I want to. He listens to me and yes he does not always agree but I am okay with that. Love is one if not the most spiritual thing in the universe after all! 

So if you're into meditation, astral projection, withcraft, Christianity, other religion, manifestion or whatever you believe in, I respect your beliefs. That is your way of spirituality and if it works for you, very good then! I am happy for you! There is no universal truth, only our individual truth. None of us know what's gonna happen and I will not allow my ego to devour me like that. 

Respect and love for all of you.",1580796092.0
spirituality,"Tipped the ladies at Dunkin $5 each and as soon as I walked out, a girl I‚Äôve wanted to reconnect with since 6th grade messaged me on Tinder.","I know $5 isn‚Äôt much, and the correlation isn‚Äôt necessarily financial but it is abundance. I had swiped on them about 2 weeks ago and it wasn‚Äôt a right-away match, couldn‚Äôt find their social media either so I figured our paths just weren‚Äôt meant to realign. When I tipped the cashiers I thought about how sweet they always are and how I wish the best for (us) black women. As soon as I stepped out, I was notified by their message. My heart is so full.

spirituality,That voice in your head that is constantly trying to make you feel guilty or ashamed about everything," 

The mind won't ever stop shaming and making you feel guilty. It is something that inevitably happens once you set on to the journey of coming to a place of no-ego.

Once you realize the ego is not something you wish to serve, it will make you ""obey"" by making you feel undesired emotions, sensations, thoughts, it will do everything possible to make you submit to the mind once again and bring you back into unconsciousness where the mind has control over what is going on.  
The one thing you need to realize is that the mind is not going to work for you, ever, you must make it work for you. You do that by understanding the mechanisms of the mind, how it is trying to manipulate you, how it is trying to take your power from you or rather, making you believe that you have no power over the mind. Hence this post.

You believe you have no power over these thoughts, emotions, sensations, you feel like they are just overpowering you and you are so desperate that you made a thread about it. Not blaming you, I am just showing you how the mind tricked you to believe you are powerless.

Now that you are aware of these tricks of the mind to keep pulling you back into this old identity of yours which was used to shaming and guilting itself (It is based on the conditioning you received as a child, teenager and adult up until this day), you were taught to feel shame and guilt, therefore your mind does these things on auto-pilot.

This is an old program of thoughts running in your consciousness right now, and you believe this program has anything to do with you. You take it personally and you feel like you need to ""deal"" with it.  
In fact, there is nothing to deal with. The only thing you need to realize is that you should be aware. You should be aware of all of these things appearing to happen within your being, it is not personal, it is just the conditioning you were made to believe in and abide by.

Now that you are aware that you are not these thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, emotions, sensations, desires, attachments and imagination that belonged to this conditioning, you can finally complete you self-realization by understanding that none of these things that you are aware of, are you.

Notice how the mind even says ""You are useless"" or ""You should feel shame"", it is saying ""You"" not ""I"", it is clearly something that is not you, funny, isn't it? None of these thoughts, sensations and emotions produced by your mind have anything to do with you, and yet it seems like they are paralyzing you in this way.

It seems to paralyze you only because you gave such an importance to these emotions, sensations and thoughts that because of this importance and belief that it has meaning, **you** gave it the power to offend you.  
You should realize that mind (thoughts, emotions, sensations etc) can't exist without you. You are the one beyond the mind.

You can exist with nothing at all, yet the mind can't exist without you. You need to realize who is the bigger one, you need to understand that the mind has absolutely 0 power over you, unless you give it the power of your belief to affect you.

What you should be doing is be aware of being aware of these thoughts, emotions, sensations. Do not identify your self as these things, as they are not generated by you. They have nothing to do with you. They are simply a kind of conditioning program that you are aware of. Be aware of being aware of that. That is the greatest power you have, the power to be your self, the stillness that is deep within any kind of storm and any kind of bullshit the mind is trying to ""attack"" you with.

Take a look, who is the mind trying to offend? It is trying to offend that old identity you believed your self to be, once you completely dis-identify from the past, and understand that it has nothing to do with you **now**, you will be able to completely carry on with your life without any real importance given to the mind. The mind can't attack you, it can only attack an idea of who you believe your self to be.

If you understand, directly experience the fact that you are **nothing**, the mind is **incapable** of touching you. It can try and offend that old identity for how long it wants to, but it has nothing to do with you. Let it be. Keep on being your self. There is no need to give importance, significance or trying to figure out why this is happening.

They are just thoughts, emotions and sensations. You were conditioned to believe this has some kind of meaning and that these are important but this is just another conditioned belief. You in fact have nothing to do with these natural phenomena that occur within consciousness. You are the universal consciousness it self, the no-thing aware of being aware, you are beyond all phenomena which appear to arise and then disappear.

Notice how everything in your life comes and goes, except that one thing. That no-thing. Which is you.

Identity, emotions, sensations, thoughts, beliefs, ideas, concepts, imagination, attachments, desires they all come, and they all go. They are unstable, inconsistent, and none of them are you. As you are the one aware of being aware of all of these phenomena. You can't be something that is coming and going. You are the no-thing aware of that. You are beyond all these phenomena, do not believe the emotions, sensations and thoughts that make you think you are scared. You **can't** be scared. It is only a thought saying ""You are scared"" or ""I am scared"" disguising itself to be you, but it is not you, it is just the mind trying to lure you back into unconsciousness. Overcome that, **Transcend** that, **realize what you truly are. The being itself. The awareness of awareness itself.**",1578483934.0
spirituality,Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value.,\- Albert Einstein,1597675475.0
spirituality,Awakening and Enlightenment are not the same,"Lots of peoples seems be confusing the two.  Awakening is simply to become aware of your true nature.  Enlightenment is when you understand everything.  This include yourself and this reality.

The reality is that it's an illusion created by your mind  to experience duality which is created by our need to label everything.   You need to come to the realization that labeling just diminish the value of anything.  You need to realize that when you remove labels and then can see everything for what they really are then you'll see that everything is the same, the rock, the tree, that chair, you, ONE.",1597543302.0
spirituality,"It is a simulation. You are simulating a perfect version of yourself that exists outside of time &amp; space.

spirituality,Has anyone else had a sudden spiritual awakening or increase in spiritual activity?,"About 3 months ago me and a close group of friends all experienced a sort of spiritual enlightenment at the same exact time. It was so vivid for myself at least, that it's completely changed me and the way I look at life. Its affected my friends very much so too, good and bad.

Ever since my first experience, it has been the most important thing in my mind; college and my future career doesn't seem all to important anymore compared to what I've been experiencing spiritually.

I think coronavirus has a role in it too, as it has forced a lot of people to look inside themselves more, as we arent as consumed with daily business, thus letting us have more alone time. 

I've been researching a lot upon this and it continues to keen my interest, along with actually seeing and communicating more with the spiritual plane. And the times I do get actual signs, I'm greeted with absolute euphoria.

I know this is probably a lot, but there's just so much I want to get off my chest, and also want to know what other people have to say.",1585268469.0
spirituality,Life comes with no instruction manual for a reason: you are to write it.,"The universe is not interested in how well you follow instructions. The universe is interested in how you respond to circumstances, because that response is a creative act.

The way things have been on our planet, our reactions have largely been dictated by conditioning‚Äîby the way we perceive our reality, which has been shaped by our culture. That does not take away from the fact that reactions and responses are a highly creative act. The universe is not interested in generic things, in exact clones and replicas, and above all, in repeating itself. God is the Creator, and a creative being lives to create. The main difference between ourselves and God, besides our degree of creative power of course, is that for all its omnipotence, the creator is not attached to its creations. Whereas for all our limitation, we are very attached, until we start learning how to be more like God and become more creative, yet more detached‚Äîin the most unconditionally loving way, of course.

By the way, my personal definitions here are: universe = God = you. Read on if this is still unclear, or send me a message.

On our planet, things are set up a certain way‚Äîand limitation is part of our paradigm. I believe that as human beings, we are biological agents of a spiritual force; spirit clothed in matter. That right there is a limitation self-imposed for a reason: a vast nonphysical being that clothes itself in matter, for a limited time, for a reason. The Universe is not separate from us; we only exist as beings who *see* themselves as separate for a reason. Our individuality matters, but not in the ways we often think. Our *creativity* is how we partake of the Divine; this is the way in which we are said to be Children of God.

Every act is an act of self-creation. The way we talk, the way we walk and the thoughts we think. Everything about ourselves, from the way we comb our hair to the way we dress and what we believe; who we socialize with, what we consume, both physically and mentally; what we do and what we don‚Äôt. It all adds up to the universal creation. It‚Äôs all part of the plan. Everything from your smallest tics and your most secret habits to the biggest things you ever did in your life: they all have helped create who you are now. The thing now is that we are starting, collectively, to learn to create *consciously*.

The goal here is to simply exist, to create, and through our experiences and our reactions‚Äîthrough our creations‚Äîlearn about ourselves more and more. The difference between ‚Äúcreation‚Äù and ‚Äúreaction‚Äù is awareness, it‚Äôs how we see things‚Äîhow we ‚ÄúC‚Äù things, how we shift that letter, how we shift our perceptions, between ‚ÄúCreation‚Äù and ‚ÄúreaCtion‚Äù. Since we are not separate from God, this is all our mission‚Äîthe adventure of every sentient being. I don‚Äôt experience my unity with all things *constantly*, every minute of every day, and I know my perception of myself as a separate being is part of the game. Still, I have had glimpses of my unity with all things, and I *do* experience my connection with something larger than myself in my daily life‚Äîthese days, especially through those darn number synchronicities, haha. Besides their individual relative meanings‚Äîbecause our reality is so multifaceted, layered and multi-dimensional‚ÄîI believe number synchronicities, and synchronicities of every kind, represent this above all: our connection to the whole.

We all have this capacity. We are all limited by design, yet unlimited in potential. As human beings, we don‚Äôt control all space and time, but we control the thing that really matters here, our innermost being, and we still have a very real influence in our immediate environment, and by extension the whole. You get to create your own universe: you get to take what I am saying here, use what you like about it and set the rest aside. Same goes for every experience we have.

Now go and be a conscious cREATOR, instead of simply a REAcTOR, and realize that this is our supreme gift as human beings. We didn‚Äôt come here to create by controlling every molecule and every atom, every circumstance and event and above all, the *reactions* of every other sentient being alive. We came here to create *our own inner experience* of the collective outer reality, with the creative tools we have been given. Those tools are our thoughts, our feelings, and the creative actions and reactions that spring from them.",1583563016.0

spirituality,All of our life experiences are lessons. Is this a privileged point of view to have???,"Over and over again I have read that we are here to learn and grow, and every experience we have teaches us something etc. All of this kind of stuff very much resonates with me and makes total sense.

I have personally experienced some hardships in my life time but have always come out the other end feeling like I have gained something, even from some awful experiences. 

But then I occasionally come across stories of people that have actually suffered some EXTREME and horrific things in their lives. Things that I can't even bear to imagine, torture, genocide, watching their own children die etc etc. And it makes all of my life's ""hardships"" seem microscopic.  


And then that got me thinking, am I just privileged in my life to be able to live in a ""oh everything happens for a reason"" mindset?

  
Like it just doesn't make sense that some people have it relatively easy in their lives while others are living in a lifelong nightmare of hell on earth. There's no way those people are thinking ""oh well, this is just the lesson I'm here to learn during this life time"".
